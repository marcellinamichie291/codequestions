# Where to put the DESC clause in this query without having an error?

I am new to sql and having issues with the following query:
SELECT AVG(people.weight),
             (people.playerid),
       (people.namefirst),
       (people.namelast),
       (batting.teamid),
       (teams.teamid),
       (teams.name)
 FROM people
 JOIN batting
 ON people.playerid = batting.playerid
 JOIN teams
 ON teams.teamid = batting.teamid
 GROUP BY (people.playerid),
       (people.namefirst),
       (people.namelast),
       (batting.teamid),
       (teams.teamid),
       (teams.name)
 LIMIT 30;

Where am I supposed to enter the DESC clause in the query without having an error ? What am I doing wrong ?
Thank you in advance.
