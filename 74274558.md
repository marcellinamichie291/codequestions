# Find all possible combinations of integers in Java

I am trying to solve the following riddle in Java:

Each symbol represents exactly one integer. The goal is to find the correct value for every symbol.
My main idea is to always calculate the first symbol*100 + the second*10 + the last. My problem is merely how to "brute force" all possible combinations for the integers. I thought about storing the possible values in Arrays, but I just can't get to any working solution.
Any help would be much appreciated.
