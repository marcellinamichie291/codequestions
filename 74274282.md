# Angular build failing only on Chrome through WampServer

I am trying to serve an Angular app locally using WampServer with apache server. I build the app using ng build, then using the build files with WampServer I serve the app locally for testing. On Mozilla everything goes perfectly fine, while on Chromium based browsers the app fails to load images, and the routing doesn't work properly.
Here are the errors on the console. The last one is what I get when I try to navigate to another component.
