# How to add find all for a key in pymongo's find() functionality

For context i am creating a HTML database filter functionality (with flask) where a user can select up to 5 options using 5 <select> element in HTML representing 5 keys in a collection of a MongoDB database. The default option in each select list is empty, represented as ' '.
So a valid output to my flask function could look like this
Output = ['dropdown1', '', 'dropdown3', '', '']
where dropdown1 and dropdown3 are possible values to associated key in the collection.
For the next step i want to use the pymongo find() to return documents from the collection matching the specifications in the Output list:
collection.find({'key1':'dropdown1}, {'key2': ' '}, {'key3':'dropdown3'}, {key4 : ' '}, {key5 : ' '} )
Now for the question:
is there a functionality like
collection.find({'key1':'dropdown1}, {'key2': 'all'}, {'key3':'dropdown3'}, {key4 : 'all'}, {key5 : 'all'} )
where 'all' represents find all values for this key. Alternatively a way to dynamically obtain:
collection.find({'key1':'dropdown1}, {'key3':'dropdown3'})
so that find() only gets select values which are nonempty:
