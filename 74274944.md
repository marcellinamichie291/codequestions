# Using monolog within a class with output to screen and e-mail

I'm using Monolog (https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) in my PHP 8.1 project with no other framework (it's only a small project), it has a main class that does the bulk of the work and the main file.  I want my program to write to the screen/a file plus e-mail the log.
I've initialised the logger:
use Monolog\Formatter\HtmlFormatter;
use Monolog\Handler\NativeMailerHandler;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
use Monolog\Level;
use Monolog\Logger;

$logger = new Logger('getData');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('php://stdout', Level::Debug));

// Email handling
$mailHandlier = new NativeMailerHandler($_ENV['MAILTO'], $serverName . " - " . implode(" ", $argv), $_ENV['MAILFROM'] ?? null, Level::Info, true, 80);
$mailHandlier->setFormatter(new HtmlFormatter());

I updated the class passing the logger instance, however I'm unsure if this is the correct way (thinking it will get a copy of the object, I thought about sending it by reference but I couldn't see others doing that), its outputs to the screen, but at the end of the script it sends no e-mail, the mailHandlier->send() is protected so cannot be accessed by the main script.
$classAPI = new classAPI($logger);

Inside classAPI
public function __construct(Logger $logger)
{
    // Inherit logging framework
    $this->logger = $logger;
 }


public function __destruct()
    {
        // Calculate runtime
        $endTime = new \DateTime();
        $timeDiff = $endTime->diff($this->startTime, true);
        $this->logger->info("API Completed: " . $endTime->format("D d M Y H:i") . ", Runtime: " . $timeDiff->format('%H:%I:%S') . " Complete");
        $this->logger->close();
     }

Any help would be much appreciated
