# DateTime Split to Date and Time

MySQL
I have a table and within the table I have a column containing DateTime. I need to seperate the column into two containing Date in one column and Time in another column.
I'm doing the below script, however, a separate table is showing instead of separating them within the same table.
    Select 
        CAST (firstcreated AS DATE) firstCreatedDate, cast (firstcreated as TIME) firstCreatedTime
    From [data].[datadata]


Select 
    CAST (firstcreated AS DATE) firstCreatedDate, cast (firstcreated as TIME) firstCreatedTime
From [data].[datadata]
