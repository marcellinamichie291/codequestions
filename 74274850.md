# Vendor-independent SQL syntax for dropping unique and primary key constraints

Precondition:
I am using Liquibase with SQL scripts in my app. I started testing with Oracle DB, but now I need to switch to PostgreSQL DB.
Problem:
When I added constraints, I didn't add the names of the constraints.
Liquibase changelog contains a script for dropping unique and primary key constraints:
alter table SCENARIO drop primary key/
alter table SCENARIO drop unique (OWNER_ID)/

This syntax doesn't sync with PostgreSQL
Could you give some advice, on how to resolve this problem?
