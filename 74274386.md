# How do I make some containers in a compose file not be accessible from the host?

I have a docker compose file declaring 7 containers: grafana, prometheus, prometheus-mongo, mongo1, mongo2, mongo3 and mongo-setup.
I would like to make the grafana container available from the host machine, make the mongo1-3, mongo-setup and prometheus-mongo not accessible from the host but they should be able to talk to each other, make prometheus and mongo-prometheus be able to talk to each other, and make prometheus and grafana be able to talk to each other.
As I am very new to Docker Networking (not Docker in general) I don't know how to set it up.
