# FreeRADIUS - What does "obsolete" modules mean?

Most of the modules on the official FreeRADIUS website are marked as "Obsolete". Specifically, I'm interested in the rml_rest module, it appeared recently, but is already outdated. Does this mean that its support has been discontinued and problems may arise in new versions, or how is this to be understood?
