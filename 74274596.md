# Swagger - Setting Default media-type or Accept Header for responses

I'm setting my API to produce both JSON And XML for POST requests, with this spring boot code:
@PostMapping(
    consumes = { APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE, APPLICATION_XML_VALUE },
    produces = { APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE, APPLICATION_XML_VALUE }
)
public Game create(
        @Valid @RequestBody Game request,
        BindingResult bindingResult
) .../

This is working fine, and I can select either JSON or XML as the media-type in Swagger, but I want the default field to be JSON - at the moment it is always XML:

How can I achieve this?
