# Read and compare data from multiple files

I'm trying to make a function that will accept a list of filenames as parameter to access data from two files at a time and compare the values, if value matches it will be added to the set and then print set.
The problem is that files have some matching values but function prints an empty set at the end.
def cross_reference(files):
    set_of_users = set()
    n = len(files)
    files = cycle(files)
    for index in range(n):
        with open(next(files), mode='r') as read_file:
            with open(next(files), mode='r') as read_file1:
                for contact in read_file:
                    for contact1 in read_file1:
                        if contact == contact1:
                            set_of_users.add(contact)
                            break
    print(set_of_users)

The files having values are:
file1.txt:
0709-12345
0724-87234
0723-67890
0721-16273

file2.txt:
0709-87263
0743-76346
0724-87234
0777-89264

file3.txt:
0724-87234
0743-87469
0709-12398
0709-78548

0724-87234 is common in all files but is not added in the set.
