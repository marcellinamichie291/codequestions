# awx to connect on private ip from kubernetes pods

I have installed AWX in kubernetes cluster and now i am trying to configure host. But the launching of host is failing because pods are in the different network and the hosts are in different network.

i need to use my private ips as these are private machines.
So how to connect on private ip from the AWX

i am new to kubernetes so no great idea on this. I just tried ping to confirm that it is not able to connect to private ip but anyhow host machine is in the same network
