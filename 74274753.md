# How to write the json for patch on Django REST Framework

I have PATCH button form on ModelViewSet

class CompanyViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = s.CompanySerializer   
    queryset = m.Company.objects.all()
    def patch(self, request, id, format=None):
        print(id)

Now I try to modify the existing data id = 1
So I write this in textarea and push PATCH button.
{
    "id":1,
    "name": ""
}

However , there comes error like
patch() missing 1 required positional argument: 'id'
Maybe my json is wrong?? How can I do PATCH?
patch() missing 1 required positional argument: 'id'
