# Sanity query always return empty array

I have two published posts. Localhost and my domain name are both in Sanity's CORS settings.
Sanity always return an empty array.
Here is my Client:


export default SanityClient({
  projectId: "******",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true,
  apiVersion: "2021-10-21",
})



And here is how I use it in my NextJS inside a getStaticProps


  const query = `*` // also tried with `*[_type == "post"]`
  return client.fetch(query).then((posts) => {
    console.log("data => ", posts)
    return {
      props: { posts },
    }
  })
