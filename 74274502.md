# Error passing argument into a a python function?

I am currently following a tutorial for making a Python Webcrawler made by thenewboston. I have a traceback error when passing an argument into a function when dealing with URLs and another Class. Below is my code which the error occurs:
PROJECT_NAME = 'tescowebsite'
HOMEPAGE = 'https://www.tesco.com/'
DOMAIN_NAME = get_domain_name(HOMEPAGE)
QUEUE_FILE = PROJECT_NAME + '/queue.txt'
CRAWLED_FILE = PROJECT_NAME + '/crawled.txt'
NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 8

queue = Queue()
Spider(PROJECT_NAME, HOMEPAGE, DOMAIN_NAME)


from urllib.request import urlopen
from linksfinding import LinkFinder
from main2working import *





class Spider:

    #Class variables (shared among all instances)
    project_name = ''
    base_url = ''
    domain_name = ''
    crawled_file = ''
    queue = set()
    crawled = set()

    def __init__(self, project_name, base_url, domain_name):
        Spider.project_name = project_name
        Spider.base_url = base_url
        Spider.domain_name = domain_name
        Spider.queue_file = Spider.project_name + 'queue.txt'
        Spider.crawled_file = Spider.project_name + '/crawled.txt'

        self.crawl_page('First spider', Spider.base_url)

Any solutions or advice would be much appreciated.
