# How do I check a Item from a Model and based on its value should decide whether it should be printed or not using C# MVC razor syntax

I am stuck in writing a condition explained below. Please help.
 @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => modelItem.QL[i].percentage)  actually prints 0.00 as value. I need to write a condition to avoid printing value 0.00 but should print other values. I provided the sample code below, can someone help me in achieving this. Your timely help will be very much appreciated. Thanks in Advance.
@model Project1.ViewModels.tbl_model

@for (int i = 0; i < Model.QL.Count; i++)
{
    **if(......)**{

    <tr>
            <td> @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => modelItem.QL[i].percentage) </td>
    </tr>

    }
    else{
    <tr>
        <td>
        </td>
    </tr>
    }

}```
