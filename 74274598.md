# Custom Axis Scale in Chart.js

Is there a way to use a function (probably needing a forward and reverse transform) to create a custom axis scale in Chart.js?
I'm looking for something similar to what is possible in matplotlib.
I know it is possible to do a logarithmic scaled axis is Chart.js, but what about a Weibull Scaled Axis or a Normal Scaled Axis?
