Over the past while, after being a Microsoft administrator for over 30 years and a Windows user since 1993, I was bested with relentless I.T. and even inexplicable hardware issues, coming from an obvious remote source, a hostile administrator. I'm fully aware of the implications. This question pertains specifically to security certificate details such as the public exponent. The public exponent showing on my system's certificates is 01 00 01. It is strange that a 17 bit exponent would be used for what is essentially beta. I'm a language and code developer within formative literary translation, not gatekeeping and encryption. I am very happy for anyone to view any message I send to anyone; I really don't believe in secrets, particularly given the level of known surveillance there is of basically everyone at all times. It doesn't bother me, but the notion that I should be bothered by a lack of privacy as a method of attempting to justify why I am unable to access standard content is frustrating. The issuers of certs are not willing to discuss this issue with me, and I have distinctly noticed issues surrounding my identity and AuthStack logins over the past couple of years. I do know, of course, it's been plainly obvious to me from the beginning, and I won't really say anything here, but isn't a 17 bit public exponent meant to be enumerated quite differently than 01 00 01? What I'm trying to do is access the web, and there are accessibility issues noted on nearly every site I visit now. It is frustrating to not see the same internet as others, and it's really bad when business resources are hidden from me. The certification process is poorly explained by everyone, and the opacity of the I.T. community when contacted directly by IP is hilarious and pathetic. Anyway, if someone wants to explain this modulus that would be cool too. I do like math and encryption. I don't intend to do any encryption; largely every message I send out could be broadcast and I wouldn't mind. However, being literally starved of resources based on what appears to be a significant administrative error is quite appalling and I do have a fair expectation of the informatics department.

I have managed to tweak my AuthStack profile enough to ask for help in the right places. If you aren't familiar with modulus

and public exponent, see that is the unique value. Anyone who works in networking knows this, and this is a very strange public exponent honestly. I'm trying to comprehend how I have been saddled with this identity. I have never accepted any certification policy and I don't intentionally perform any encryption or hide any aspect of my activities from anyone! I'm an open book, and people who interact with me know that I have the propensity to broadcast our interactions at my whim. I live in a studio capable of broadcast and am occasionally doing just that for extended periods. My ability to broadcast has been impinged, as has my ability to simply view content. If anyone wants to assist, hopefully I can hit you back better than Jason has this far amirite my brothers in arte?
