# How to use pandas.ewm.mean with a halflife and a non-adjusted decay?

I am creating a test dataframe as follows:
import pandas
index = pandas.date_range('2022-11-01 08:00', '2022-11-01 08:02', freq='T')
data = [1] + [0] * 2
df = pandas.DataFrame(data, index, columns=['val'])

This result in the following dataframe:

                      val
2022-11-01 08:00:00   1
2022-11-01 08:01:00   0
2022-11-01 08:02:00   0


I am now trying to decay the series with a halflife of 1 minute:
df.ewm(halflife='1 minute', times=df.index).mean()

I get the following result:

                      val
2022-11-01 08:00:00   1.000000
2022-11-01 08:01:00   0.333333
2022-11-01 08:02:00   0.142857


I find this result unexpected, as I would think that with a halflife of 1 minute, the observation at 08:01, 1 minute later, the value should have decayed by 1/2, yielding 0.5.
Looking at the documentation, I see there is a parameter adjust
When set to false, it calculates the decay as

This looks like what I want, but when I try to specify adjust=False I get the following exception:
df.ewm(halflife='1 minute', times=df.index, adjust=False).mean()


NotImplementedError: times is not supported with adjust=False.

and then when I try to remove times, I get a different error:
df.ewm(halflife='1 minute', adjust=False).mean()


ValueError: halflife can only be a timedelta convertible argument if times is not None.

So how can I get the decay that I expect, using a halflife?
