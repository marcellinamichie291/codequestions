# Base table or view not found: Table doesn't exist ERROR while trying to insert some data

I have a Laravel 9 project and in the migration of one of the tables, I would like to insert some data as well when creating the table:
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('tag_filters', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('tag_name');
        $table->string('tag_uri')->nullable();
        $table->string('tag_color');
        $table->unsignedBigInteger('tag_parent')->nullable();
        $table->timestamps();

        $table->foreign('tag_parent')->references('id')->on('tag_filters')->onDelete('cascade');

        DB::table('tag_filters')->insert(
            array(
                [
                    'tag_name' => 'javascript',
                    'tag_color' => 'f9bc64',
                ],
            )
        );
    });
}

But now when I run the migrations by saying php artisan migrate, I get this error:
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'forum.tag_filters' doesn't exist (SQL: insert into tag_filters...
So what's going wrong here?
How can I properly insert some data when creating a new table via the Migrations in Laravel?
