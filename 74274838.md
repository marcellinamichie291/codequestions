# ERROR - No response from gunicorn master within 120 seconds

i have freshly installed on ec2 instance on ubuntu, the installation was successfull but after that when i try to run "airflow standalone" to run airflow, it won't start.
Below is the error i get, do i need to install anything else also before running "airflow standlone" command.
My ultimate goal is to deploy python code for data transformation in my data-pipeline.
please help ?
