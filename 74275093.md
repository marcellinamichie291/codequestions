# Kotlin context receivers cannot resolve members of generic type

In the following code, the call member of Animal cannot be resolved even though Cat is specified as context receiver and it has a member named call.
interface Animal { val call: String }
object Cat : Animal { override val call: String = "Meow" }
object Dog : Animal { override val call: String = "Woof" }

fun <T : Animal> acquireAnimal(animal: T, block: context(T) () -> Unit) {
  block(animal)
}

fun main() {
  acquireAnimal(Cat) {
    call
  }
}

When I type this inside the lambda, then the IDE seems to suggest that the type of this is Any?.

If I do the same with a function without a generic context receiver, then it seems to get the type right.

Is this a limitation that is by design or is this a bug?
