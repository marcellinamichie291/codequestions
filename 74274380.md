# Connecting spring boot docker container to MQTT docker container

I'm trying to connect my containerized spring boot application with another containerized MQTT broker. Both of them are on their own projects as follows:
mqtt docker-compose.yml:
version: '3.9'

services:
  mqttbroker:
    container_name: mqttbroker
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./config:/mosquitto/config
      - ./data:/mosquitto/data
      - ./log:/mosquitto/log
    ports:
      - 8883:8883
    networks:
      - mynetwork
volumes:
  config:
  data:
  log:

mqtt Dockerfile
FROM eclipse-mosquitto
WORKDIR /mosquitto
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8883

And then the spring boot project is like:
spring boot docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  myapp:
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - '8082:8082'
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    networks:
      - mynetwork

In my application.properties I try to connect to the MQTT broker like:
mosquitto.url=tcp://mqttbroker:8883 and I get connection refused. However, if I run the spring boot application locally, I can connect to the docker container with mosquitto.url=tcp://localhost:8883.
I would rather have all the configurations in my docker-compose files to decrease manual codes.
I really appreciate your help in advance!
