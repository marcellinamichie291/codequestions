# Deploy app to a physical iPhone with connected Mac build host

i'm trying to debug an app on my iPhone connected to my windows 10 pc via usb. I have successfully connected VS for Windows (Version 17.3.6) to my build host (Mac in Cloud). I can also debug my app with the "Remote Simulator to Windows" or via Hot Restart. All this works.
But i'm not able to deploy the app for debugging on my physical device, which is build on the mac build host.
I tried disabling Hot Restart, because i have a build host and Hot Restart is without a build host. But if i disable Hot Restart the connected device disappears from die VS device list. Only remote device and the simulators are visible.
I expect, that VS uses die build host to build the app and delploy it to the connected device. Is this not possible or i miss something?
Thx
