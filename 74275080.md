# Replacing items skips values

I have a file that includes Database Name and Label - these labels correspond to sectors. My script goes as follows:
I read an excel file that has sector names on it, I then use this to get an allocation of calcrt_field and sector:
es_score_fields['esg_es_score_peers']= es_score_fields.iloc[:,10:100].apply(lambda x: '|'.join(x.dropna().astype(str)), axis=1)
once I have each calcrt_field aligned to the relevant peers (sectors), I read another file that has 2 columns: Database Name and Label. The end goal is to map the score peer sectors to each of these Database Names, examples:
Database Name1: Chemicals (123456)
Label1: Chemicals
Database Name 2: Cement (654321)
Label2: Cement
Once I read the file i use the following (multiple rows) to remove any symbol, space, comma:
score_peers_mapping.Label= BECS_mapping.Label.str.replace('&', '')
this gives me a list with both Database Name (no changes) and Label (all words combined into a single string)
I then map these based on string length as follows:
score_peers_mapping['length'] = score_peers_mapping.Label.str.len()
score_peers_mapping= score_peers_mapping.sort_values('length', ascending=False)
score_peers_mapping
peers_d = score_peers_mapping.to_dict('split')
peers_d = becs_d['data']
peers_d
finally, I do the following:
for item in peers_d:
esg_es_score_peers[['esg_es_score_peers']]= esg_es_score_peers[['esg_es_score_peers']].replace(item[1],item[0],regex=True)
I exported to csv at this stage to see if the mapping was being done correctly but I can see that only some of the fields are correctly being mapped. I think the problem is this replace step
Things I have checked (that might be useless but thought were a good start):

All Labels are already the same as the esg_es_score_peers - no need to substitute labels like i did to remove "&" and so on
Multiple rows have the same string length but the error does not necessarily apply to those ones (my initial thought was that maybe when sorting them by string length something was going wrong whenever there were multiple outputs with the same string length)

Any help will be welcome
thanks so much
