# Using Feign clietn with Pagable in SPRING boot

I have two microservices - A and B.
Microservice A has an endpoint that returns a list of users.
List<UserResDto> findUserRoleId(
        @RequestParam List<UUID> roleId)

There is a microservice B that calls this endpoint from service A to get users in the scheduler.
@Override
@Scheduled(cron = "${scheduler.cron-job}")
public void getUsers() {


var users = userRestClient.findUserByRoleId(
        USER_ROLES)
        .stream()
        .collect(Collectors.toList());


userRepository.saveAll(users);

}

Since there are too many users, I get a GATEWAY 504 timeout.
Can I get these users page by page without changing anything in service A?
I tried increasing the timeout but that only solved the readtimeout problem, but the feign.FeignException$GatewayTimeout: [504 Gateway Time-out] during [GET] "message":"The upstream server is timing out" error doesn't go away.
