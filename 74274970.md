# List of nodes that allows us to get to 50% of the network (gephi)

So, I'm using gephi to get to know more a network (undirected network) with no weights.
This is the dataset.
Now I'am trying to do a more advanced analysis and i don't think it's possible in gephi.
Problem: CanÂ´t find the list of nodes that would allow me to reach more than 50% of the network
Thank you for you help!
I have tried filtering with different filters but doesn't get me that result.
