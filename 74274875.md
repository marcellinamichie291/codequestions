# Why can't I write to an @ObservedObject?

I have a struct called Activity which has an id (UUID), name (String), description (String) and timesCompleted (Int).
I also have a class called Activities that contains an array of Activity structs called activityList. Activities is marked with ObservableObject.
I have activities declared as a @StateObject in my ContentView and I pass it to my ActivityDetailView where it is declared as an @ObservedObject.
However I can only partially write to activities.activityList in the child view. I can append, but I can't overwrite, update or remove an element from the array. No error is thrown but the view immediately crashes and the app returns to the main ContentView.
How do you update/write to an @ObservedObject? As you can see from the comments in my updateTimesCompleted() function I've tried all kinds of things to update/overwrite an existing element. All crash silently and return to ContentView. Append does not fail, but isn't the behavior I want, I want to update/overwrite an array element, not append a new copy.
Activity Struct:
struct Activity : Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var description: String
    var timesCompleted: Int
}

Activities Class:
class Activities: ObservableObject {
    @Published var activityList = [Activity]() {
        didSet {
            if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(activityList) {
                UserDefaults.standard.set(encoded, forKey: "activityList")
            }
        }
    }
    
    init() {
        if let savedList = UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: "activityList") {
            if let decodedList = try? JSONDecoder().decode([Activity].self, from: savedList) {
                activityList = decodedList
                return
            }
        }
        activityList = []
    }
    
    init(activityList: [Activity]) {
        self.activityList = activityList
    }
    
    subscript(index: Int) -> Activity {
        get {
            assert(index < activityList.count, "Index out of range")
            return activityList[index]
        }
        
        set {
            assert(index < activityList.count, "Index out of range")
            activityList[index] = newValue
        }
    }
}

ContentView:
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var activities = Activities()
    @State private var showingAddActivity = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(activities.activityList) { activity in
                    NavigationLink {
                        ActivityDetailView(activity: activity, activities: activities)
                    } label: {
                        Text(activity.name)
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Habits")
            .toolbar {
                Button {
                    showingAddActivity = true
                    let _ = print("add activity")
                }
            label: {
                Image(systemName: "plus")
            }
            }
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingAddActivity) {
            AddActivityView(activities: activities)
        }
    }
}

ActivityDetailView:
struct ActivityDetailView: View {
    @State private var timesCompleted = 0
    let activity: Activity
    
    @ObservedObject var activities: Activities
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                Text("Activity: \(activity.name)")
                Text("Description: \(activity.description)")
                
                Stepper {
                    Text("Times Completed: \(timesCompleted)")
                } onIncrement: {
                    timesCompleted += 1
                    updateTimesCompleted()
                } onDecrement: {
                    if timesCompleted > 0 {
                        timesCompleted -= 1
                        updateTimesCompleted()
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Activity Details")
        }
    }
    
    func updateTimesCompleted() {
        let newActivity = Activity(name: activity.name, description: activity.description, timesCompleted: timesCompleted)

        let _ = print("count: \(activities.activityList.count)")
        
        let index = activities.activityList.firstIndex(of: activity)
        let _ = print(index ?? -666)
        if let index = index {
            activities.activityList[index] = Activity(name: activity.name, description: activity.description, timesCompleted: timesCompleted)
            
            //activities.activityList.swapAt(index, activities.activityList.count - 1)
            //activities.activityList[index].incrementTimesCompleted()
            //activities.activityList.append(newActivity)
            //activities.activityList.remove(at: index)
            //activities.activityList.removeAll()
            //activities.activityList.append(newActivity)
        }
    }
}
