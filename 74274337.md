# How to rename files name with package.json script?

I created a template repository and want to somehow change the file name when someone uses the template to create it is own project.
For example, the project has TemplateController.ts file, I would like to be able to change the name on npm install or so and change it to the for example UserController.ts.
Also, be able to change folder names if name is a template and change the code part if there is a "template".
I did research, and maybe I should create a file with sh extension.
