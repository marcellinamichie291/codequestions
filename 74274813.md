# Preparing data for the generator and discriminator

I am getting values from a directory
dateset = image_dataset_from_directory(
                            'Fruit-Images-Dataset-master/Training',
                            subset='training',
                            seed=42,
                            validation_split=0.1,
                            image_size=image_size
)

And I want to send a set of data like this to the generator and discriminator
   [[image][tags][title]] 
   # image = [0.99607843, 1.         ,0.99215686, ...] 
   # tags = [Tomato, Tomato Cherry Red]
   # title = 1.png

But the problem is that I don't understand how to interact with the data set.
I tried to catalog images like this
 Training
   Tomato
      Tomato 1
        1.png
          ...
       Tomato Cherry Red
         1.png
         2.png
            ...

But in class_names it displays only Tomato and does not see Tomato Cherry Red
How can I make it so that there are more than one label?
I tried to go through each element separately
SIZE = 224
def resize_image(img, label):
  img = img.numpy().astype("uint8")
  img = tf.cast(img, tf.float32)
  img = tf.image.resize(img, (SIZE, SIZE))  
  img = img / 255.0  
  img = np.concatenate(myimg, axis=1) 
  return img, label
train_resized = training_dateset[0].map(resize_image) # Преобразовать

But got
 'PrefetchDataset' object is not subscriptable?

But when I write print(training_dateset) i get BatchDataset
for some reason it works with PrefetchDataset from tfds.load without problems
How do I properly prepare the data (Edit them)? So that their structure is something like this
  [
    [[image][tags][title]],
    [[image][tags][title]],
    [[image][tags][title]]
  ]
