# How to conserve italic font when exporting Inkscape SVG to EPS on Ubuntu?

On Ubuntu 20.04, whenever I try exporting an Inkscape (0.92.5) SVG drawing containing italic text to EPS, the result has only straight text (same font), independent of whether I select "Embed fonts" or "Convert text to paths".
Interestingly, doing the same on my Mac (macOS 11.6.7, Inkscape 1.2) doesn't give this issue.
My problem may be related to this question: Weird symbols when exporting SVG to EPS using Inkscape, but unfortunately this doesn't have an answer that fixes the issue.
