# Send data between page and modal dialog in Blazored

I have a page that lists some data in a table, in the last column I have created a
<td>
  <a class="nav-link" href="Edit/@item.id">
   <span class="oi oi-pencil" aria-hidden="true">Edit</span>
  </a>
</td>

That open the Edit page, and send the id with it. Recently, I found Balzored library which allow creating modal (pop up like) dialogs.
If I need to open a page, I would
<NavLink class="nav-link" @onclick="@(()=>modal.Show<Create>("Create"))">
   Add New
</NavLink>

But how can I pass the @item.id to the Edit page in Blazored.
The Edit page has @page "/edit/{Id}" as the first line.
