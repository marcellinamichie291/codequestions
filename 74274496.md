# How to run Google maps api through cloud functions

I am trying to run api through cloud function for which the data should be loaded for a future time instance but instead the data is being fetched on current onClick method when the user is inputting the data. I want the data to be fetched even when the app is terminated through cloud for notifications.
user gives details of when notifications is to be triggered and api is to be run in future as reminder but instead the notification and api is being triggered when the user is submitting the data on onClick event.
