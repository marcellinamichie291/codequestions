# Rate Limit for only success requests (Laravel 9)

Is there anyway to apply rate limiting to the route but for only success responses. Like for example if user sends request to send/code endpoint 5 times and if all of them was successful then block the user to send request again. But if 2 of them was unsuccessful (like validation error or something) but 3 was successful then user should have 2 more attempts for the given time.
I know rate limiting checks before request get executed, then block or let the user to continue. But is there anyway to apply my logic or should I try to approach differently?
