# how to use $val to get value from map in helm for kubernetes?

I got a map in values.yaml:
Schedule:
  app1: node01
  app2: node07
  app3: node13

and I want to use it in template/app.yaml:
{{- $tuplei := untilStep 1 4 1 -}}
{{- range $keyi, $vali := $tuplei }}
---
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeName: {{ $.Values.Schedule.node$vali }}

It can't work:

Error: parse error at (xxx/templates/app.yaml:51): bad character U+0024 '$'
helm.go:94: [debug] parse error at (xxx/templates/app.yaml:51): bad character U+0024 '$'

I have tried some ways, but still can't make it.
#{{- $ScheduleName :=  printf "app%d" $vali }}
#nodeName: get $.Values.Schedule "$ScheduleName"
#can't work, too.
