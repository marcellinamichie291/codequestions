# JS download blob before browser tab close

I have implement a Screen Record feature into my webapp and I want to stop and download the recorded video if user tries to leave while recording is in progress.
So I used the onbeforeunload event to call the recorders stop function. This works as expected when user reload/refresh the page. But it does not work if user closes the TAB or the BROWSER.
So is there anyway to force the browser to save/download the blob data before tab/browser close ?
