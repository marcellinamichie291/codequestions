# I'm trying to make a simple typing game, I just can not find the problem as to why the other functions won't start when the game ends

After the game is over, I need the correct and total keypresses to appear, along with the accuracy of the keypresses.
def correct_presses():
    global correct, total
    correct_displayer.hideturtle()
    correct_displayer.penup()
    correct_displayer.goto(-250,250)
    correct_displayer.pendown()
    correct_displayer.write("You got",correct,"amount of keypresses!", font=font_setup)

def total_presses():
    global correct, total
    total_displayer.hideturtle()
    total_displayer.penup()
    total_displayer.goto(250,250)
    total_displayer.pendown()
    total_displayer.write("You clicked",total,"amount of times.", font=font_setup)

def accuracy_of_presses():
    global correct, total
    accuracy_displayer.hideturtle()
    accuracy_displayer.penup()
    accuracy_displayer.goto(0,250)
    accuracy_displayer.pendown()
    accuracy_displayer.write("You got",correct//total*100,"percent of your keypresses correct.", font=font_setup)

def end_of_game():
    global correct, total
    if len(curr_letters) == 26:
        correct_presses()
        total_presses()
        accuracy_of_presses()

When the last letter is pressed, those things should appear, but they do not.
