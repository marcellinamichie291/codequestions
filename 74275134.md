# How to filter request to api-gateway's controller in api-gateway

I use a custom api-gateway for services and my gateway has a controller (for handling rest request making a grpc request to another service).
Also I have a CustomGlobalFilter for filtering rest requests. It works good for routes, but doesn't work for requests to api-gateway controller. I need to handle and filter requests from front to all services including api-gateway in one CustomGlobalFilter.
We have tried to change @Order and endpoint-api.
Routes configuration includes Api-gateway's apis.
Any suggestions? Did anyone face such kind of problem, if so how did solve it?
