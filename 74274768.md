I have this array [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6] and I'm trying to add each number inside it so that the sum of the two numbers is equal to 10, but so far it can only add the same number to itself and not two different numbers. How can I do this with javascript?
in this array for example the function should return [-1, 11]
my function


function sum(array) {
    let result = 10;
    let newArray = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] + array[i] === result) {
            newArray.push(array[i], array[i]);
        }
    }

    return newArray;
}

let array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6];
console.log(sum(array));
