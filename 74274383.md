# django-plotly-dash multi session on CPU intensive pages

Running -
django-plotly-dash
I have multipole python pages, the issue is that when I am loading one of the pages while it is running some calculations, I can not run the same page or other pages from a different session, and the webserver is not responding for other users. if I look at the runserver output, it is busy rendering the first request only.
