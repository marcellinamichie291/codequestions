# Module not found: Can't resolve '@apollo/client' - import {gql,useQuery} from '@apollo/client'; in next app

I am working on my first project using apollo for my course. I did not write this code it was writing by a MIT teacher a few years ago so I am thinking that maybe the issue. The following picture is a screenshot of one of the components that is having an issue and the terminal output. I have installed apollo-client since npm install apollo/client does not work and graphql just in case but still am getting this terminal output and am unable to complete 2 full modules because of these issues.
