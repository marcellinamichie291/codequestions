# how to have Bootstrap make my component drop below another component

I think I get the basics of bootstrap and how to assign sizes to colums. But somehow I don't seem to solve this simple usecase.
Usecase :
I have 2 components, let's say for a Todo-list application:

component 'New Todo' (Form Input field)
component 'Todo List' (Table List)

I would like to achieve that on large screens the 'New Todo' component is on the right (taking half the screen) and the 'Todo List' component is on the left (taking also half of the screen).
But on small (mobile) screens, the 'New Todo' component should be on the top and the 'Todo List' component should move below it.
Extra question : how can I make the 'New Todo' input field collapsable on small mobile screens ?
