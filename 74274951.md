# GGplot2 add background colour to legend title

I want to change the background colour of only the legend title (not the entire legend).
If I start with the below code:
library(tidyverse)
#produce a ggplot
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, colour=Species)) + 
  geom_point()


I can use theme( legend.title = element_rect( fill = "lightblue",  size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", colour = "black")) to change the background of the entire legend which isnt what I am after.
Is there anyway to just change the background colour of the legend title ?
