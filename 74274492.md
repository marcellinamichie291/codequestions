# Why are Netconf 1.1 RPC operations are defined with same old XML namespace?

RFC 4741 defines Netconf 1.0 and RFC 6241 defines Netconf 1.1. Section 3.1 of these RFC says that;
All NETCONF protocol elements are defined in the following namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0


My query is; RFC6241 has defined a new RFC <cancel-commit> with the same XML namespace. Do not we need a new namespace to identify this new RPC operation? Please clarify.
Please clarify the role of Namespace.
