# ffmpeg transparent background with colorkey shows background bleeding

I am creating a video with transparent background video with the following command. After creation I want to overlay this video on another video
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=red:s=1920x1080,colorkey=red,format=rgba -loop 1 -t 0.08 -i "CreditWhite.png" -filter_complex "[1:v]scale=1920:-2,setpts=if(eq(N\,0)\,0\,1+1/0.02/TB),fps=60[fg]; [0:v][fg]overlay=y=-'t*h*0.02':eof_action=endall[v]" -map "[v]" -pix_fmt yuva444p10le -vcodec prores_ks credits.mov

Creating the video works fine but when I overlay this on another video (using openshot) I get a lot of color bleeding of the background colour around the edges. Any suggestions to improve the ffmpeg prompt to stop this from happening? I tried very slightly increasing the opacity (0.06) as mentioned in another thread without success.
