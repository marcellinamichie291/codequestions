# Is there a way to create a npm package containing other packages modules as export?

I want to create a base npm package that exports modules from other packages such as react-router-dom & MUI etc.
in my index.ts file of the base-package I have
export * from 'react-router-dom';
and in my application, I'm using
import {BrowserRouter} from 'base-package'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <BrowserRouter>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Import is successful But I'm getting the following error

PS : I tried the similar approach with 'react-icons' which works flawlessly
