# Package acceptance validation error: The package Documents.msix doesn't contain any Application elements in the app manifest file

I made a .exe from a .py and from there I made an installator and the passed it to msix with the windows tool.
when uploading the .msix, this error appears:
Package acceptance validation error: The package Documents.msix doesn't contain any Application elements in the app manifest file.
how can I solve this?
