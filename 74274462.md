# MySQL select over the result set again

EDIT, because wrog problem description (sorry for that!)
I need a query in MySQL that loops through the selected rows and creates a result array. The pattern for this is shown below.
Currently I call a select again and again. Is there a way to create a single query from this? Thanks a lot!
Table structure
ID, VID, AID, ... (title, etc.) ... TID

Select over the vid field

SELECT id, vid, aid FROM tbl WHERE vid = 24;
ID  VID AID
1   24  NULL
2   24  NULL
3   24  712
4   24  713
5   24  714
6   24  715
7   24  716
...


If aid not null => select the same table with the AID value as condition for another field

SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE TID = 112
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE TID = 113 
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE TID = 114 
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE TID = 115 
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE TID = 116


Result should be (all null rows and the selected rows from above)

ID  VID AID   ...
1   24  NULL
2   24  NULL
75  24  712
79  24  713
88  24  714
92  24  715
97  24  716

The problem in this e.g. is that i need a loop and tones of selects. Pseudocode:
rows = [] 
foreach (main_select)
{
    if (aid != null)
    {
        selected_row = select * from tbl where tid = aid
        rows[] = selected_row
    }
    else
    {
        rows[] = main_select_row_from_iteration
    }
}
