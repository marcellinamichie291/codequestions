# Instagram Graph API for Extracting Views Count of Public Profile Posts

I am currently using business_discovery from graph API as the endpoint for extracting basic media details from public/non-owned Instagram profiles. However, one of the major parameter missing from this endpoint is video/reels views count. Is there any possible endpoint through which I can retrieve view count of video posts from public profiles?
