# copy text from tmux inside VSCode

I use VSCode on macOS, I ssh into Linux remote station and here I run tmux (inside VSCode integrated terminal). However, I am not able to copy any text from tmux into system clipboard when used like this. I am not even able to select the text using mouse - when I select any the selection highlight disappears immediately.
The copying to system clipboard works if:

I run tmux inside separate window of iTerm2
I run normal zshell inside VSC integrated terminal

How to copy text from tmux inside VSC integrated terminal?
