# Firestore emulator missing some collections after being successfully launched

I've been trying to launch a test/copy firestore in my local emulator and everything is great, except for one thing: my firestore emulator is missing collections and stops working because of unknown reason.
I have exported prod Firestore DB to local storage as 'some_date.tar' extention and unarchived this file to my project root. After which I have run firebase emulators:start --import ./firestore-local-data (i am already logged in to firebase and project is selected). The emulator runs correctly and functions are working, but when you go to UI of the emulated Firestore you can not open all collections and view them. For example smaller collections work just fine, but as soon as I open the huge one it all breaks and I can no longer open even smaller if I had not opened them before the huge one. I enabled flow control in my Windows 10 as traceback suggests but it didn't help. I also noticed that when I click on the 'department' collection I get 400 Bad Request. Please help me to solve this issue. Thank you!
