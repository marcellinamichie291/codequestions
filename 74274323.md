# Custom django permissions for group chats?

I have a custom group model like this:
class MyGroup(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200,null=True,blank=False,default="Group name")
    members = models.ManyToManyField(get_user_model(), blank=True, related_name="grpmembers")
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(get_user_model(), on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=False, related_name="createdby+")
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(editable=False)

It works, it's fine, I override the save method in django admin so the created_by will point to the logged in user on save.
Problem #1
Even if you are the creator of the group, you can select yourself to either be in- or be removed from the group which kinda looks silly. I'm thinking of solving this by saying the user can view the group if they're in members or created_by.
Problem #2
Custom permission. I want to have some permissions, like:

Can view the group: which means the user is either the creator or is in the members list
Can edit the group: which means the user is the creator(can edit their own) or is staff(can edit anyone's stuff) or is superuser(root)

I can write it down and imagine how it would work, but I have no idea how to implement these.
I've found some ways, like creating a Meta and defining permissions there and also making the permissions as def(/functions), but how could I access the currently logged in user?
Like okay let's say I do
def can_view_group(self):
r1 = self.filter(members=req.user) # where req.uset is not accessible bc we're in models.py

, but how do I tell the permission to check the currently logged in user?
