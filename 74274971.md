# R - Calculate means including all factor levels but one

lets say, we use the dataframe mtcars and I would like to add the column qsec_control which is calculated as the mean(qsec) of all rows that don't have the same cyl as the current row (e.g. if cyl == 6, it would take mean(qsec[cyl != 6]) ).
The question feels somewhat dumb, but I cant figure out how to do this.
Thanks in advance
