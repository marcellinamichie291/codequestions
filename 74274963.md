# Documentation on specific a-scene element attributes

how do I find out what the optimal attributes on the <a-scene> tag should be? seen a few different values for 'renderer' and 'ar-js' attribute, such as trackingMethod etc but I'm having trouble locating the best document to learn about what they all do? can anyone point me to the right page?
