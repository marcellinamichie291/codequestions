# csv file formatting but no modules or importing is allowed

import os
#checkit is a file that contains data about snow and weather in a csv format
#check that it exists
checkit = "test.cs"
def file_exists(checkit):
    if not os.path.exists(checkit):
        raise FileNotFoundError("no data about snowfall.")
    else:
        pass
#functioncall
file_exists(checkit) 

#functioncall

list1 = []
#open the file  
with open(checkit, "r") as file_snowfall:
    #loop it over line for line and strip and split
    for line in file_snowfall:
        myline_strip = line.strip()
        list_line = myline_strip.split(",")
        my_list.append(list_line)
    #make sure that the content of the header column is not empty -> no empty strintgs
    header = list1[0]
    for values in header:
        if len(values) > 1:
            pass
        else:
            print("the input of the header is too short")
            break


This is my code so far.
I know that I need to read the lines is by using deadline (to only read the header first).
Then I also need a condition that checks that headers with inputs such as:
[["snowfall: "indiana"],[]....].
Is working as well.
So I need to check that there are the strings only accepted. However, I am not allowed to use regular expressions. Also no csv / panda import allowed.
It is in photon.
I tried a lot. if you could show me a working example I would be very glad.
