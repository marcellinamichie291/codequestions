# How to get access token from google sign in?

I am trying to get access token of the user who confirmed his id from google sign in. My code is,
useEffect(() => {
        /* global google */
        if (typeof window !== undefined) {
            console.log('w', window)
            window?.google?.accounts?.id?.initialize({
                client_id: clientId,
                callback: handleCallBackResponse,
            })
            window?.google?.accounts?.id?.renderButton(
                document.getElementById('signInDiv'),
                {
                    theme: 'outline',
                    size: 'large',
                }
            )
        }
    }, [])


here, from the handleCallBackResponse function, i don't get any access token rather i get three things which is client_id, credential, and btn. Btw i need access token.
The response object from handleCallBackResponse is,
{clientId: client_id, credential: credential_token, select_by: "btn"},
