# Trying to recover my lost linux partition (dual boot windows/deb)

Some months ago, I've changed my boot order to make my windows in first boot position. Since this day I can't boot on my linux anymore because I don't see it when i'm booting.
After some research I've found that the problem may come from the fact that i've installed my Linux partitions with LVM, which may not be a good idea on a dual boot. But i'm not sure of anything.
I did not try a lot of things cause i'm a bit a newbie, and i would love to get my linux content back without breaking it.
The only things i've done is to look at my disk partitions to see if my linux was at least still there.

If someone knows anything !
