# How to search multiple post title in wp query

I trying to fetch wp query using multiple post title but post title or s accept only one parameter.
This is my code:
$post_title = array(
'book', 
 'car',
 'bike'
);

         $conditions = array( 
              'posts_per_page' => 9, 
              'paged' => $paged,   
              'post_type'   =>'custom',
              'order'            => 'DESC',
              's' => $post_title,
              'post_status' => "publish", 

            );


        $the_query = new WP_Query( $conditions );
