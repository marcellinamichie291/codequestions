# Not getting JS file from Google Sheets

In my google sheet I tried the B1 cell to become a valid JS staement by below formula.
="var name =" & " '"& A1 & "' ;"

Then cell B1 becomes valid statement  var name = 'Raj Paul' ;
By publishing the sheet, I tried to make it as a script file for my webpage like below

Then I used this as a script source file in wp hosted webpage JSbySheets
Below is the code.
<p>Hi, This is <span id="shvar"></span> </p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSQIORejF59NZEyEigMfHFpNcs-XCjKyUbTSrcWJcR0Mn3DO6oSHWeGfm3XvnqQBj1ipMI00I-r5qH7/pub?gid=0&single=true&range=b1&output=csv">

function shvar () {
document.getElementById("shvar").innerHTML = name ;
}

</script>

Here in code I tried to get a variable named name
The value of the variable is Raj Paul
Actually my Paragraph element should like below
Hi, This is Raj Paul
But it's not returning the value, how to get this ..?
