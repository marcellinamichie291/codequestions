# How to look for a problem with low RPS in VisualVM?

There was a problem with the high response time of my Spring application.
My colleagues advised me to use VisualVM, simultaneously running the load using Jmeter. I want to check which method takes the most time
However, in VisualVM I get an uninformative answer - there are no methods of my application.
Can you tell me if I'm going the right way and how to display information on methods inside the application?
