# Perform DOM operation after it was updated inside onMutate in react-query

I wrote a component called Chat (some parts are omitted for simplicity):
function Chat() {
  const containerRef = React.useRef(null);
  const messages = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["messages"],
    queryFn: api.getMessages
  });
  
  const createMessage = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (message) => api.createMessage(message),
    onMutate: (message) => {
      // 1. cancels query, updates cache, returns previous value
      optimisitcUpdate(messages, message);

      // 2. scroll to bottom
      const { current: container } = containerRef;

      // ❌ won't work, because the DOM is not updated yet
      container?.scrollTo(0, container.scrollHeight);

      // 💩 works, because the DOM is updated, but it's hacky
      setTimeout(() => container?.scrollTo(0, container.scrollHeight))
    },
  });

  return (
    <div id="messages" ref={containerRef}>
      {messages.data?.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.uuid}>{message.body}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

It's pretty straightforward. useQuery to fetch all messages, useMutation to create a new message, and return all of the messages.
Whenever createMessage occurs, I want to optimistically update the messages and then scroll to the bottom (like any other chat behavior).
The problem is, I have no way of doing flushSync inside useMutation, so as a workaround, I wrap the logic inside a setTimeout, but that's a hacky way.
I was wondering if there's a more robust approach than this.
