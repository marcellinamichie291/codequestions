# Unable to pull sleep data via android native sdk from Google Fit

I have tried multiple ways of pulling sleep data from GoogleFit but have not been successful. I am able to pull other data but not sleep data.
We have already received approval from google following relevant permission:
Scope Approved Name : .../auth/fitness.sleep.read

Below code we have tried.
val client = Fitness.getSessionsClient(this, getGoogleAccount())

val sessionReadRequest = SessionReadRequest.Builder()
        .read(DataType.TYPE_SLEEP_SEGMENT)
        .includeSleepSessions()
        .readSessionsFromAllApps()
        .setTimeInterval(periodStartMillis, periodEndMillis, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        .build()

client.readSession(sessionReadRequest)
    .addOnSuccessListener { response ->
        for (session in response.sessions) {
            val sessionStart = session.getStartTime(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            val sessionEnd = session.getEndTime(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            Log.i(TAG, "Sleep between $sessionStart and $sessionEnd")

            // If the sleep session has finer granularity sub-components, extract them:
            val dataSets = response.getDataSet(session)
            for (dataSet in dataSets) {
                for (point in dataSet.dataPoints) {
                    val sleepStageVal = point.getValue(Field.FIELD_SLEEP_SEGMENT_TYPE).asInt()
                    val sleepStage = SLEEP_STAGES[sleepStageVal]
                    val segmentStart = point.getStartTime(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                    val segmentEnd = point.getEndTime(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                    Log.i("TESTSLEEP", "\t* Type $sleepStage between $segmentStart and $segmentEnd")
                }
            }
        }

I was expecting dataset object to return the user sleep data. But unfortunately, it is not.
I would really appreciate if somebody could look at the code snippet and let us know what we are doing wrong. Thanks for your help and support.
