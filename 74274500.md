i tried the answer in the How can I make infinite grid with canvas? but it just a fake grid with limited wide and high
const init_infgrid = () => {
  canvas_infgrid = $c('canvas');
  canvas_infgrid.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas_infgrid.height = window.innerHeight;
  c_infgrid = canvas_infgrid.getContext('2d');

  canvas_infgrid.addEventListener("mousedown", e => {
    reset();
    start_infgrid = getPos_Infgrid(e)
  });
  canvas_infgrid.addEventListener("mouseup", reset);
  canvas_infgrid.addEventListener("mouseleave", reset);

  canvas_infgrid.addEventListener("mousemove", e => {
      if (!start_infgrid) return;
      let pos = getPos_Infgrid(e);
      c_infgrid.translate(pos.x - start_infgrid.x, pos.y - start_infgrid.y);
      draw();
      start_infgrid = pos;
  });
  $('#canvasarea').appendChild(canvas_infgrid)
  draw()
}

function draw() {
    let step = 50;
    let left = 0.5 - Math.ceil(canvas_infgrid.width / step) * step;
    let top = 0.5 - Math.ceil(canvas_infgrid.height / step) * step;
    let right = 2 * canvas_infgrid.width;
    let bottom = 2 * canvas_infgrid.height;
    c_infgrid.clearRect(left, top, right - left, bottom - top);
    c_infgrid.beginPath();
    for (let x = left; x < right; x += step) {
        c_infgrid.moveTo(x, top);
        c_infgrid.lineTo(x, bottom);
    }
    for (let y = top; y < bottom; y += step) {
        c_infgrid.moveTo(left, y);
        c_infgrid.lineTo(right, y);
    }
    c_infgrid.strokeStyle = "#888";
    c_infgrid.stroke();
}

// Mouse event handling:
let start_infgrid;
const getPos_Infgrid = (e) => ({
    x: e.clientX - canvas_infgrid.offsetLeft,
    y: e.clientY - canvas_infgrid.offsetTop
});

const reset = () => {
    start_infgrid = null;
    //no want to reset translation
    //c_infgrid.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); // reset translation
    draw();
}
