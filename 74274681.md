# How to add option that will accept string discord js

I can't find a solution to my problem. I want to create a change_nick command and I don't know the type/number of this option to use.
My command creator:
commands.create
            (
                {
                    name: 'change_nick',
                    description: 'changes nick for specified person',
                    options:
                    [
                        {
                            name: 'user',
                            description: 'user that name will be changed',
                            type: 6,
                        },
                        {
                            name: "new_username'
                            description: "new username",
                            type: "" //thath's what i'm searching for,
                        },
                    ]
                },
            );

I tried browsing and reading the documentation but I couldn't find anything
