# VBA automation error, The specified module could not be found when try to create Pcom object

I am using IBM Pcom 64bits and micro office 64bits, and I would like to use VBA to interact with Pcom.
I created an Excel file with VBA, however, there is an error "automation error, The specified module could not be found" when execute this:
Set autECLSession = CreateObject("PCOMM.autECLSession")
And the weird thing is that, if I put this Excel to my "Desktop", it works! For other locations, it will always "automation error, The specified module could not be found".
I would like to make this Excel with VBA works everywhere, any idea what happens?
