# In c++ we declare a vector like this. std::vector<int> v(6); how to do it for two dimensional vector

std::vector<int> v(6);

how to declare a two dimensional vector with limits like above code for one dimension
I'm a noob in c++. I tried like this:
`
std::vector<int> v(6)(2);

`
I expected a two dimensional vector with 6 rows and 2 columns to take input in.
I know how to declare 2d vector. I just wanted it with limit.
