# How to get 'coordinates' out of a list?

So i have a map in a list that looks like this (+ is obstacle, - is free path):
map = [
    '-------'
    '++--++-'
    '-+++---'
    '---++++'
    ]

I want to build a program that prints out the coordinates of an obstacle, so output should look like this:
list_of_obstacles : [ (1, 2, 2), (5, 6, 2), (2, 4, 3), (4, 7, 4) ]
#(start_of_obstacle, finish_of_obstacle, line)
I hope it makes sense. Thank you in advance for all the answers.
