# export Oracle DB schema in H2 format with liquibase. Difference between `sql` and `xml` outputs

I'm exporting a Oracle schema, and I want to have a script that I can use for in-memory tests  with H2.
I export the schema with maven, mvn liquibase:generateChangeLog.
I have noticed that when I specify an outputChangeLogFile of type sql, the Oracle and H2 formats produce different output (e.g. generatedChangelog.h2.sql vs generatedChangelog.oracle.sql).
With type xml they produce the same ( generatedChangelog.h2.xml vs generatedChangelog.oracle.xml).
In particular, with the sql type I get

NAME VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL for H2
NAME VARCHAR2(255 BYTE) NOT NULL for Oracle

with the xml format I get

<column name="NAME" type="VARCHAR2(255 BYTE)"> for both H2 and Oracle

this particular syntax is not valid with H2, so this seems a bug to me. Liquibase can clearly understands this as you can see from the sql example, but it doesn't produce a valid changeSet for the xml format.
Is there anything I can do to produce the correct output in xml format?
Thanks
