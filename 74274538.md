# How can I combine a line of code with the data.frame() function?

I've written a line of code to calculate GDP change over a decade. I want this to appear in the published report. However, it appears without titles - specifically, Country and Value.
This is the code I've written:
#code for GDP growth 1960 to 1970
round(with(Belize_1960_1970, (Value[Year == 1970] - Value[Year == 1960])/Value[Year == 1960])*100)

In this case, the output was 90.
To improve the published 'look', I used the data frame function, as it would allow me to include Country and GDP_percent
country <- "Belize"
GDP_percent <- 90
df <- data.frame(country, GDP_percent)
print(df, row.names=FALSE)

I then hid the code and output which I had used to calculate the change in GDP, leaving the data frame with its labelled information. As a workaround, it functions well.
However, is there a neater solution which would combine the data.frame() function with the line of code I used to calculate the change in GDP?
My solution was very clunky:
#code for GDP growth 1960 to 1970
data.frame(round(with(Belize_1960_1970, (Value[Year == 1970] - Value[Year == 1960])/Value[Year == 1960])*100))
