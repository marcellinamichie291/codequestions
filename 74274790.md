# integrate caddy with datadog container on AWS

I am trying to enable logging in my application that uses a caddy file and send metrics to datadog.
The datadog container that I run in the AWS Fargate task definition is running and the agent is waiting for traces but, of course, not receiving any as the logging is not enabled.
the application itself is very simple:
exec caddy run --config ./Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile

with caddyfile:
{
    admin off
    auto_https off
    http_port 8080
    https_port 8433
    log {
       output stdout
       format json
     } 
}

:8080 {
    file_server browse
    root * /mnt/cvdupdate/databases
}

I have read that there is a datadog plugin for caddy
that sends traces to datadog but I cannot manage to set it up?
what is the correct way?
