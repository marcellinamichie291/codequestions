# how can i disable a specific collision in unity 3d?

hi i was making a multiplayer game where at some point the bullet was colliding with the sender and i don't want that. It keeps making glitches and the bullet keeps floating. I even tried reducing the player box collider but its still getting stuck. if i disable collision detection for the player and the bullet, the multiplayer version will be affected and players won't be dying
Please help
tried to reduce the player collider but when the bullet is shot on y axis its getting stuck
