# How can I simplify the For loop(c++)?

I found a code on the internet to encrypt user input with Caesar encryption. But in the code the loop head bother me, because we didn't have things like "message[i]" or "\0" in class. Is it possible to write this in a different way? But we had not used arrays as far as in this loop header. This is not homework or anything like that. I'm practicing for my computer science test next week and there will probably be something similar. The loop header always looked like this for example for(i = 0; i < 4; i++). How can I write this code without arrays?
How can I write the loop differently? Or do I have to change other code parts?
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char message[100], ch;
    int i, key;
    cout << "Enter a message to encrypt: ";
    cin.getline(message, 100);
    cout << "Enter key: ";
    cin >> key;
    for (i = 0; message[i] != '\0'; ++i)
    {                    //<-
        ch = message[i]; //<-
        if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')
        {
            ch = ch + key;
            if (ch > 'z')
            {
                ch = ch - 'z' + 'a' - 1;
            }
            message[i] = ch; //<-
        }
        else if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z')
        {
            ch = ch + key;
            if (ch > 'Z')
            {
                ch = ch - 'Z' + 'A' - 1;
            }
            message[i] = ch; //<-
        }
    }
    cout << "Encrypted message: " << message;
    return 0;
}
