# Helm: Is it possible to access values from pre-existing resources in a template?

I manually deployed some secrets in my cluster. Is it possible to access these in a Helm template to create other secrets?
I.a., I want to put coordinates to a pre-existing secret in my values.yaml and let Helm create another secret using values from this first secret.
Is this possible, and if yes, how should I achieve that?
