# Download mp4 file in reactjs

I need to download a mp4 file in the way chrome does and show the estimated time.
Approach 1. For that I am using this in my react code
return axios({
    url: data,
    method: "GET",
    responseType: "blob",
  })
    .then((response) => {
      FileDownload(response.data, `video.mp4`);
      return response;
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err, "this is filedownload err");
      return err;
    });

Which takes a lot of time as it first fetch the data using axios and download the blob data.
Approach 2. I am using anchor tag but it is opening it in different tab and playing the video in html video player.
<a href="https://XXXXXsample/test/new/ab9e3ff2-c4a2-4823-bd48-367d1de53a50.mp4" download="file">Download</a>

In the second approach can I click on the html video player download button programmatically?
