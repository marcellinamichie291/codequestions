# How to build up a binomial logit model or Poisson model for non-negative response variable in SAS?

My outcome variable is non-negative for the number of hospitalizations, my main predictor variable is a dummy variable for whether receiving home hemodialysis or clinic hemodialysis. Therefore, it seems that I need to build up a negative binomial model or poisson model (patients admitted to hospital is not so many, so the distribution is very right heavy tailed). What about the exact coding is?
