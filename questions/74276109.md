How to make a label hide in the webpage but it must be readable for screen readers
<label for="phone" aria-describedby="input">
<p id="input"> message </p>
</label> 


this one works for one field I am trying the same for the Separate fields .
there is 3 fields for phone number local code , prefix last one is suffix
which is in the same row but different Column , under these fields i have provided an example for the input so whenever the people uses screen reader it must read the example along with the field name .

imagine this as my fields , the example as 123-456-7890
any inputs would be appreciable !!
