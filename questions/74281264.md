I coded the following for a game and I am trying to get the same code to be part of a method and make a few changes to make the game have a next level. Can you help make this a method?
private void label_click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{ 
    if (firstClicked != null && secondClicked != null)
        return;
    Label clickedLabel = sender as Label;
    if (clickedLabel == null)
        return;

    if (clickedLabel.ForeColor == Color.Black)
        return;
    if(firstClicked==null)
    { 
        firstClicked = clickedLabel;
        firstClicked.ForeColor = Color.Black;
        return;
    }
    secondClicked = clickedLabel;
    secondClicked.ForeColor = Color.Black;
    checkForWinner();
    if (firstClicked.Text == secondClicked.Text)
    {
        firstClicked = null;
        secondClicked = null;
        Score = Score + 10;
    }
    else
        timer1.Start();
}
