# How to include a new JavaScript file to my Statamic application?

I am trying to include a new js file into my Statamic application. As per the Statamic documentation I changed the file AppServiceProvider.php
in the boot method I added
Statamic::script('App', 'newfile.js');

But it doesn't load the javascript file. Is there anything else I have to do to make the script working?
