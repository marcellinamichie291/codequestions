# How to get the autoscaling group name from software.amazon.awssdk.services.ec2.model.Instance object

I have a few ec2s and I know their private ips. I probably can get those instances with the following java code (havent tried yet)
 List<String> ec2ips = new ArrayList<String>();
 ec2ips.add("100.71.234.22");
 ec2ips.add("100.71.234.12");
 Filter filter = Filter.builder()
                .name("network-interface.addresses.private-ip-address")
                .values(ec2ips)
                .build();

 DescribeInstancesRequest request = DescribeInstancesRequest.builder()
                .filters(filter)
                .build();

     
 DescribeInstancesResponse response = ec2.describeInstances(request);

 for (Reservation reservation : response.reservations()) {
     for (Instance instance : reservation.instances()) {
         System.out.printf(
                        "Found reservation with id %s, " +
                                "AMI %s, " +
                                "type %s, " +
                                "state %s " +
                                "and monitoring state %s",
                        instance.instanceId(),
                        instance.imageId(),
                        instance.instanceType(),
                        instance.state().name(),
                        instance.monitoring().state());
     }
 }

I dont see however a way of getting the Autoscaling group name the instance is in from the Instance object. There must be a way?
