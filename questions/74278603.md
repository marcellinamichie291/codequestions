i want to implement a Gui like Visual Studio in Maui. There is a library that made this quite easy for WPF https://github.com/Dirkster99/AvalonDock/issues however i didn't find anything for Maui that does the same. Additionaly this library has to be in Xaml / c# (instead of in blazor), because it has to work with nested xaml compontents.
If anyone knows a library like AvalonDock but for Maui id be quite thankfull ^^
(preferably a free or pay once library)
I tried implementing it myself, however i prefer no to blow all my time budget, so a library is the only sensible solution.
