# STM32 Boot pin functions

I have a question about the BOOT pin performance of the STM32.
In the datasheet says that upon reset, the boot pin (PA13) is established at the beginning as the picture shows.

I wanna know if it is only at the beginning of the reset and then I can use the BOOT pin as an ADC pin???
