# How to catch exceptions with a custom base exception class raised in other package

My goal is to catch only the base exception instead of explicitly catching all the self-defined exceptions.
It.  I cannot get it works if the exception is raised in other packages.
The project structure:
./
    /packageA
        __init__.py
        a.py
    /packageB
        __init__.py
        b.py
        exceptions.py

# b.py
import exceptions as ex

def help():
    raise ex.xxException

I know this can be done with first defining an abstract base exception class, then inherit it.
# exceptions.py

class myException(Exception): pass

class xxException(myException): pass

class yyException(myException): pass

It works only when it is raised and catch within the same package.
When I do somthing like:
# a.py

from packageB import b, exceptions

try:
    b.help()
catch exceptions.myException:
    print("base ex")
catch exceptions.xxException:
    print("xx ex")
catch Exception:
    print("ex")

# output: ex
