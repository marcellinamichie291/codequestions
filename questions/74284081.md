# How to configure Mailgun on Heroku review app

I have the MailGun addon working successfully on my staging app in Heroku. I am trying to configure it for my review apps on the same pipeline. Here is my app.json:
{
    "name": "App name",
    "repository": "https://github.com/...",
    "stack": "heroku-22",
    "environments": {
        "test": {
            "scripts": {
                "test": "yarn test"
            },
            "formation": {
                "test": {
                    "quantity": 1,
                    "size": "Standard-2X"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "addons": [
        "mailgun:starter"
    ]
}

I've got the same mailgun env vars in the review app configuration as I do the functioning staging app. When I try to build review apps, I get the error:
An error occurred

Could not create test run. The account "...@herokumanager.com" is not permitted to install the mailgun add-on at this time. Your account may require additional verification. Please visit https://tools.heroku.support/addons-verification to complete this process.

Following the link leads me to a page requesting my phone number. I enter it. I get a verification text with a Heroku Add-ons Verification code, which I then enter into the next screen. But I still can't build the app without the error.
