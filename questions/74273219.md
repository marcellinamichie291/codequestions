# How the request.data can used for switching the django class view?

I am trying to use single API to call the different class based view. Actually planning to solve this by using another function. Is this pythonic way?
My Urls.py
from django.urls import path
from masterdata import views
from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns

urlpatterns = [
    path('AAA/', views.AAAList.as_view()),
    path('AAA/<str:pk>/', views.AAADetails.as_view()),
    path('BBB/<str:pk>/', views.BBBList.as_view()),
    path('BBB/<str:pk>/', views.BBBDetails.as_view()),
    ]


urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(urlpatterns)


my Views.py
class AAAList(APIView):
   "some operation"

class AAADetails(APIView):
   "some operation"

class BBBList(APIView):
   "some operation"

class BBBDetails(APIView):
   "some operation"



My actual need is I want to switch these class using single Url with passing the body data in the method.
url looks like,
path("",views."somefunction or class")

How can I achieve this?
i try to solve this by an creating function in views.py
def switcher(request):
if request.GET.get("body param")==AAA:
    return AAA.as_view()(request)
elif request.GET.get("body param")==AAA:
    return BBB.as_view()(request)
