# What causes CLS in my site? Simple divs and tables

I have been trying to figure out what is causing CLS on my site for a very long time, I have completely re-coded it, but the problem persists.
It is a simply PHP+HTML website.
If possible, I don't want to write the URL of my site here, I would send it in a private message if someone could help. The problem must be very trivial.
Thank you!
