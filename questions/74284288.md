I want to implement a simple animation of pressing a piano button in Pygame.
Pressed a key – it changes color, released it – returns to its original state.
For example, when pressing and holding the "A" key on the keyboard, the button changes color to gray, and when released, it returns to its original state.
How to implement such animation if there are a lot of buttons? For example, 88 pieces.
The code will be very large.
Below is an example for 3 buttons.
import pygame
pygame.init()
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 500, 400
FPS = 60

window = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH,HEIGHT))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
GRAY = (125, 125, 125)

color1 = color2 = color3 = BLACK

window.fill(WHITE)        

play = True
while play:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            play = False
        
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_a:
                color1 = GRAY
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_a:
                color1 = BLACK
        
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_s:
                color2 = GRAY
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_s:
                color2 = BLACK

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_d:
                color3 = GRAY
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_d:
                color3 = BLACK

    pygame.draw.rect(window, color1, (30, 30, 20, 160))
    pygame.draw.rect(window, color2, (55, 30, 20, 160))
    pygame.draw.rect(window, color3, (80, 30, 20, 160))

        
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(FPS)
    
pygame.quit()
