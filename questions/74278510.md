# oracle sql developer empty mrp_orders_v

I am using Oracle database
Oracle Applications : 11.5.10.2
There are table apps.mrp_orders_v that I can't query in "oracle Sql developer"
"select * from apps.mrp_orders_v" but no data is returned
The funny thing is when I use the same credentials thru ODBC and microsoft Access or Power query in excel then I can see the data
Any idea?
There are lots of other tables where I can see data from the oracle database thru oracle sql developer
Kind regards
John
