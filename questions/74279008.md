# How to NULL Address records that do not have an alpha AND numeric character with RegEx?

I'm just looking for some help in NULL-ing address records that do not have an alpha AND a numeric character.
I tried a Regex version of this and it just NULL'd all the values:
Case when address like '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%' then address else NULL end as clean_address
Examples of what I'm trying to accomplish.
Address Values with:

'none' becomes NULL
'.' becomes NULL
'pobox' becomes NULL
'123 Street #$' becomes NULL

These Address Fields get retained:

'123 Sesame Street'
'123 Sesame Str.'
'Pobox 123'

Thank you all for your help.
Tried a regex and it didn't work as expected
