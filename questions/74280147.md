# Python Type Hint Instances of class

I'm unsure of the Python convention for type hinting for this situation
I have a class
class A(object):
     pass

And a not defined number of subclasses of A, i.e.:
class B(A):
     pass

class C(A):
     pass

class D(A):
     pass
.....


If I want that a function, accepts only instances of B,C,D, and not instances of A, what is the correct typing notation?
def fnc(x: # Only instances of B,C,D,...):
   pass

With the notation
def fnc(x: A):
   pass

the function will accept also instances of A itself, correct?
