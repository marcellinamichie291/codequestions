# Karate: Can we use "match each" twice in same line for 2 different assertions?

Basically, I want to achieve the below assertions in a single statement
* match each obj[*].id != ''
* match each obj[*].name != ''

-> obj: its a list of JSON objects returned as the response to an API
The below code snippet does not work.
* match each obj[*].id != '' && each obj[*].name != ''

can this be achieved in karate?
