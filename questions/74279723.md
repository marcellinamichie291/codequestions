# SSIS Feed Account Numbers From Excel File as Criteria

hoping to be guided in the right direction with this.
I have an Excel sheet with about 7,900 account numbers. I need to feed those account numbers into a SQL query to pull data on those accounts. I would normally be able to just import that into a SQL server but I don't have access to this server to bring the data in for use. I'm having to do this through SSIS.
Is there a way to have SSIS read each row for the account numbers and feed them into my query as a variable?
I haven't tried anything with this yet as this would be the first time trying something like this in SSIS.
