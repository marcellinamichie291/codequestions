# C#: How to refer to child class's member in parent method

I am implementing 2 kinds of ByteMessage creater class using Inheritance like below.
abstract class MessageCreater
{
    int messageSize;
    void validateMessage(byte[] message)
    {
        if (message.Length!=messageSize)
            throw new Exception("Length not proper");
    }
    
}
class XMessageCreater: MessageCreater
{
    static readonly messageSize = 10;
    public byte[] Create()
    {
        byte[] message;
        // specific procedure here
        validateMessage(message);
        return message;
    }
}
class YMessageCreater: MessageCreater
{
    static readonly messageSize = 20;
    public byte[] Create()
    {
        // specific procedure here
        validateMessage(message);
        return message;    
    }
}

My problem is, to make it short, When validating the message length, messageSize always equals 0 (this is perhaps because the parent class member "messageSize" was being initialized as 0).
when validating in XMessageClass, messageSize variable should be 10, and in YMessageClass, should be 20.
Can you give me a clue to make it work like this?
Using Inheritance is not necessary.
