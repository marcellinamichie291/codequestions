# How to know which Support Library version my Android app is using?

In my gradle.properties I have this:
android.useAndroidX=true

When I Make Project, I get BUILD SUCCESSFUL. From Android Studio, I go to Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX... I am getting 15 references in 9 files to be changed:

Reading https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/migrating-to-androidx-tip-tricks-and-guidance-88d5de238876, I see that the step 1 of the recommended approach to migrate is to Update to Support Library version 28. In order to do that, I want to know what Support Library version the code of my app is at. Where can I see that? In some of my .java files I have found the following:
import android.support.annotation.NonNull;
import android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.support.v4.content.ContextCompat;
import android.support.v4.app.ActivityCompat;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;
import android.support.multidex.MultiDex;

In my app\build.gradle I have this: implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'.
Do any of the lines above reveals or helps to reveal the Support Library version that the code of my app is at? Thank you.
