# Why some metrics in kube-state-metrics are not scrapped?

My objective is to create query in PromQL to answer the question "What is the current CPU and memory usage of specifc pods?". Looking at the definition of kube-state-metrics it should be achievable by using metric 'kube_pod_overhead_cpu_cores' however those metrics are blank. My endpoint at this point look like this:

# HELP kube_pod_overhead_cpu_cores The pod overhead in regards to cpu cores associated with running a pod.
# TYPE kube_pod_overhead_cpu_cores gauge
# HELP kube_pod_overhead_memory_bytes The pod overhead in regards to memory associated with running a pod.
# TYPE kube_pod_overhead_memory_bytes gauge

And there is none info regarding those metrics.
I've read something about RuntimeClass associated with Pod Overhead but i dont know if it is the right direction in order to solve this problem...
