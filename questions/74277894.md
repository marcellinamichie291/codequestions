I want to know the how can i create an oracle procedure to find out the distinct records from whole table and insert into same table by updating value of another column
Suppose the table name is temp and below is the structure of the table
| id       | address              |  key  |ver_id
|  1         | 242  Street          |  123  | 1
| 2          | 242 Street           | 123   |2
| 3          | 242  Street          |  123  |3
| 4          | 242 Long St          | 456   |4
So,how to write a oracle procedure to select 1 record from first 3 rows for above columns which is duplicate and insert that distinct record at the end of the table by updating ver_id as -1  like below:
| id       | address              |  key  |ver_id
|  1         | 242  Street          |  123  | 1
| 2          | 242 Street           | 123   |2
| 3          | 242  Street          |  123  |3
| 4          | 242 Long St          | 456   |4
|  5         | 242  Street          |  123  |-1
I have tried to write the simple procedure to find out the duplicates from table
create or replace PROCEDURE demo (
key1 IN VARCHAR2
) AS
CURSOR c_temp IS
SELECT
*
FROM
temp
WHERE
key = key1;
r_temp c_temp%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
OPEN c_temp;
LOOP
FETCH c_temp INTO r_temp;
EXIT WHEN c_temp%notfound;
dbms_output.put_line('id: '
|| r_temp.id
|| ' address: '
|| r_temp.address);
END LOOP;

CLOSE c_temp ;

END;
But above procedure is just fetch the records with duplicate records, but i need help to write the procedure to select distintct records from duplicate and insert into same table with different ver_id as -1
