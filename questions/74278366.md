I write a program that inputs the day/month/year and prints the day/month/year the next day. But when running again, the results are not satisfactory. Please suggest me 1 solution or tell me where I am wrong.
My knowledge is just learning if_else.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int d, m, y;
  cin >> d >> m >> y;
  // d: date
  // m: month
  // y: year

  if ((m == 1) || (m = 3) || (m = 5) || (m  = 7) || (m = 8) || (m = 10)) {
    if (d = 31) {
      cout << 1 << " " << m + 1 << " " << y;
    } else {
      cout << d + 1 << " " << m << " " << y;
    }
  } else if (m == 12) {
    if (d == 31) {
      cout << 1 << " " << 1 << "" << y + 1;
    } else {
      cout << d + 1 << " " << 12 << " " << y;
    }
  } else if ((m == 4) || (m == 6) || (m == 9) || (m == 11)) {
    if (d = 30) {
      cout << 1 << " " << m + 1 << " " << y;
    } else {
      cout << d + 1 << " " << m << " " << y;
    }
  } else {
      if ((y % 400 == 0) || ((y % 4 == 0) && (y % 100 != 0))) {
        if (d == 29) {
          cout << 1 << " " << 3 << " " << y;
        } else {
        cout << d + 1 << " " << 2 << " " << y;
        }
      }  else {
        if (d == 28) {
          cout << 1 << " " << 3 << " " << y;

        } else {
        cout << d + 1 << " " << 2 << " " << y;
        }
      }
    }
}
