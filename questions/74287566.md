# Eloquent ORM (Laravel/PHP) does not use variable?

 foreach($jsons as $key => $value) {
                    if ($value != 'e19f9a5d-fa1c-4209-893f-50b24c299774') {
                        if(Person::where('id', 'like', $firstEightSymbolsOfId . '%')->where('instagramId', '=', $value . '%')->exists()) {
                            error_log('Made it in');
                            error_log($value);
                            return $this->badRequestResponder->validationError(['message' => 'Already in database!']);
                        } else {
                            error_log('Made it in2');
                            error_log($value);
                            $instagramId = $value;
                        }
                    }

So when I use this code with a staticly typed value in the eloquent orm statement where('instagramId', '=', 'someusername')->exists() the above code goes into first else block and prints "Made it in" & also the content of $value, but when I put in where('instagramId', '=', $value . '%') to check dynamicly if the value is in the database already, it goes into the else block and still assigns $instagramId = $value, even if the provided value already exists.
What am I doing wrong here, since I also provide an id in the first where statement and this one works. Has it something to do with the foreach loop or something? I am not that good in php, so it would be nice to get some help.
