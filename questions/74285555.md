# How to Stop useEffect running infinitely when using useNavigate inside it

I am making an e-store. I have the uid of logged-in user. I am trying to make a condition that if the logged in user uid is not equal to admin uid, then I do not want that user to go on the admin page. The useEffect runs infinite.


    const navigate = useNavigate();
    const user = localStorage.getItem("uid");

    useEffect(() => {

        if (user === 'at64ZIYgqaawRyCAkH6xMYBRNwS2') {
            navigate('/admin')
        }
        else {
            navigate('/home')
        }
    })
