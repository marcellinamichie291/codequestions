# How to test whether stringstream operator>> has parsed a bad type and skip it

I am interested in discussing methods for using stringstream to parse a line with multiple types. I would begin by looking at the following line:
"2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678"

Now lets assume I have a long line that has multiple strings and doubles. The obvious way to solve this is to tokenize the string and then check converting each one. I am interested in skipping this second step and using stringstream directly to only find the numbers. 
I figured a good way to approach this would be to read through the string and check if the failbit has been set, which it will if I try to parse a string into a double. 
Say I have the following code:
string a("2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678");

 stringstream parser;
 parser.str(a);

 for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
 {
     double b;
     parser >> b;
     if (parser.fail())
     {
         std::cout << "Failed!" << std::endl;
         parser.clear();
     }
     std::cout << b << std::endl;
 }

It will print out the following: 
2.832
1.3067
Failed!
0
Failed!
0

I am not surprised that it fails to parse a string, but what is happening internally such that it fails to clear its failbit and parse the next number?
