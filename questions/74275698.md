# Clipping CT numbers for deep learning

"For learning efficiency during the training, the HU values on the CT image is clipped between -1000 and +1000, and then normalized to -1 to +1". What are the reasons for applying **clipping **and normalizing HU values of a CT image during the training of a deep learning model?
