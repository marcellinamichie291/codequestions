# Axios does not catch any of the error responses in vue

I have a function created that makes an axios get API call. When the api responds successfully everything works fine, but when the API call has any kind of error it does not reach the catch block. For example:
 public async getData() {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://599d6a620a785b0011f4f6c8.mockapi.io/users');
        console.log('success', response)
      }catch( error) {
        console.log('errr',error);
      };
    }

I get the following response in the console:
success {data: Array(100), status: 200, statusText: 'OK', headers: {…}, config: {…}, …}

Now, when i change the url of the above function (to mimic a 404) to:
 public async getData() {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://599d6a620a785b0011f4f6c8.mockapi.io/toReturn404');
        console.log('success', response)
      }catch( error) {
        console.log('errr',error);
      };
    }

I get the following responses

Even though it should have been thrown to the catch block it stays in the try block.
I tried recreating it in the stackblitz but it works as expected there : Stackblitz
Axios version in both stackblitz and the project is : "axios": "^0.27.2",
