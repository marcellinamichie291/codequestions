# What is the difference in Job between JobModifyIndex, ModifyIndex and Version?

In the Nomad Job JSON specification we can find the following fields, from https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/api-docs/jobs#read-job :
    "JobModifyIndex": 637478,
    "ModifyIndex": 637480,
    "Version": 1,

What is "JobModifyIndex"? What is "ModifyIndex"? How do they differ? What is the relation between them and job "Version"?
