# Assigning people to rounds based of preference with a limit

Here is a concise description of my problem. Assume there are N number of people in a math tournament. The tournament is split into 6 different rounds each with varying topics. Any person has a skill set that is better suited for a specific round. Say that rounds are numbered 1-6 and a person, call them Tom, will perform well in rounds 1,3,5. Say another person will perform well in rounds 2,3. Each person may only be put into 3 rounds and each round MUST have at least 5 people. I’m trying to design an algorithm that will assign each person a set of rounds so that the maximum amount of people are in the most amount of rounds that they will perform well in. However, I’m not sure how to do this. I would try to brute force this as a backup plan but I would like a better (if any) solution. Does there exist a problem similar to this that I can refer to?
I have tried researching problems such as this but have only found the Stable Marriage Problem. This problem is different from mine however. Trying to brute force this is also difficult because I’m not sure how to generate combinations of people and rounds given the limits of 3 rounds per person and 5 people at least round
