# How to chunk a string with HTML in JavaScript

I need to "paginate" strings of unknown length that may contain arbitrary HTML tags. Like a book, I need to avoid clipping in the middle of words, so the page/chunk lengths can be shorter than the target length but not longer. I also need the HTML preserved in the chunks.
const exampleString = "I am a string with some <bold>HTML</bold> tags that need to be <i>preserved</i>"

function chunkHtmlString(string, pageLength) {...}

const pages = chunkHtmlString(exampleString)
console.log(pages)

The logged output would be:
[
"I am a string ",
"with some <bold>HTML</bold> ",
"tags that need ",
"to be <i>preserved</i>"
]

What's the best way to do this? Splitting strings is easy without the HTML. Answers to similar questions involve using regex to strip out HTML, but I've found that using regex with HTML can be surprisingly difficult if the set of tags is not simple, and then I would somehow need to re-injective the markup after the pages are created.
