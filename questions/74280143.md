# No output to CSV using PowerShell psobject in Active Directory

I have this portion of code here that has worked in the past in multiple AD environments, however after testing within a new AD environment, I am getting no output to CSV or any errors being thrown. The size of the CSV file is always zero.

if (![string]::IsNullOrEmpty($searchbase))
    {
    $ADComputers = get-adcomputer -searchBase $searchbase -filter * -properties * -ResultPageSize $resultpagesize
    }
    else
    {
    $ADComputers=Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties * -ResultPageSize $resultpagesize
    }

$data = @()
foreach ($computer in $ADComputers) {
    $computer.member| foreach-object {$members += $_}
    $computer.memberof | foreach-object {$memberof += $_}
    $memstr = ($members -join ";")
    $memstr2 = ($memberof -join ";")

        $ADcomp = Get-ADComputer $computer -properties logonCount, ManagedBy | select-object logonCount, ManagedBy
    
        $row = New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{
        PrincipalID = $script:ctr;
        logonCount=$ADcomp.logonCount;
        ManagedBy=$ADcomp.ManagedBy;
        
        }

    $data += $row
    $script:ctr++
}
$data | Export-Csv "ADComputers.csv" -NoTypeInformation

I'm not sure exactly where to go from here because I have tested multiple different options, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
