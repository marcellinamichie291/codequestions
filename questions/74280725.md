# Using '*' instead of '_' in imports

I have a project which is the code of an API.
In build.sbt the version of Scala is:
scalaVersion := "2.13.8"

In several Scala files I see imports using * instead of _ like this:
...
import sttp.tapir.*
...

How is that? It is my understanding that * can be used in Scala 3, but not in 2.1x ... I can't see any library (it's a big codebase) or something related to this ...
Why does it works instead of showing compiling errors?
