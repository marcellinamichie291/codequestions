# Ubuntu Desktop on Raspberry PI - silent boot

So I've got Ubuntu Desktop 22.10 on my Raspberry PI running and need it to silently boot the desktop.  (Splash is okay which I will be changing to a custom image.) But there is one bit of text that keeps showing that won't ever go away.
The text that shows up is a date (that looks like an uptime sort-of) and then a line of text that looks like info about the file system:
Thu Jan  1 00:00:03 UTC 1970
writeable: clean 194919/1921904 files, 1926064/7725947 blocks

Any clues on how to stop this from displaying?
Here's what I've tried:

Edit /etc/default/grub file:

GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet loglevel=0 rd.systemd.show_status=false rd.udev.log-priority=0 vt.global_cursor_default=0"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet loglevel=0 rd.systemd.show_status=false rd.udev.log-priority=0 vt.global_cursor_default=0"

And also created the file /etc/sysctl.d/20-quiet-printk.conf
with the contents:
kernel.printk = 0 0 0 0

Only other bit of information I have is that the text shows up just before the Ubuntu logo  screen.  I also don't see anything similar to this in Dmesg.
I'm just an old C# developer who is now tasked with setting this up for a new testing device and I'm stuck.  Help please! ðŸ™‚ Thanks!!
