# VUE Need Pinia store info before mounted hook to retrieve from database

I am building a VUE application that uses Pinia as a store and Firebase as a database. I am trying to access a collection from Firebase on page load that requires me to have the logged in users uid.
Currently, I have stored the user.uid inside a user store created by Pinia.  The two hooks I have used are setup and async created. When running this, the error I get is that this.authStore.user.uid evaluates to undefined.
setup(){
    const db = getFirestore(firebaseApp);
    const authStore = useAuthStore();
    return { authStore,db,};
  },
  
async created(){
    const q =  query(collection(this.db,this.authStore.user.uid)); //This does not exist
    const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q);
    querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
      // doc.data() is never undefined for query doc snapshots
      this.data[doc.id] = doc.data();
      // console.log(doc.id, " => ", doc.data());
    });  
  },

I believe I need a method to delay the running of the function within created, however I am not sure how to wrap the whole code block in an await function to wait for the value uid to be available.
