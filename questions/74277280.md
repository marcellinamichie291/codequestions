# List comprehension correct format to include extended expression

I ma trying to iterate through a list of numbers to calculate the largest number, using list comprehension, but the syntax seems to be evading me. Precisely, I am not able to figure out where to place the expression. I am trying to use a counter, and store the largest number of the list in the counter. Is there a problem in my approach? Any help would be much appreciated. I have gone through a lot of questions concerning list comprehension but I have not been able to locate a working syntax to place the expression in list comprehension.
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,722,4,35,353,5,4634,64,64,634,4,3]
counter= 0
b = [counter = num for num in a if num > counter]
print(b)

I am not able to figure out how to utilize the expression. I used this code block to capture the largest number in the list using a counter variable and for loop. What could be the working syntax to write this using list comprehension?
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,722,4,35,353,5,4634,64,64,634,4,3]
counter = 0 
for number in a:
    if number > counter:
        counter = number
print(counter)
