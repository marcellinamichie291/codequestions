# Pandas to_csv error: need to escape, but no escapechar set

I am trying to convert a TXT file to CSV UTF-8 using Pandas. So far I have the following, which works in most cases:
if filepath.endswith(".txt"):
            filetxt = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='delimiter', engine ='python')
            #lineas = len(filetxt)
            filetxt.to_csv(subdir + '/' + fileWEx + '.csv', index=None, encoding='utf-8', sep=';'

But on certain files, I get the error: "Error: need to escape, but no escapechar set"
The file has the following "characters" which I assume are causing the error:

Is there a way to fix it with Pandas or is it required to open the file to deal with these values?
