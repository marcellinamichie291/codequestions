# Pandas query not working in some versions

I have the following code:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name':['john','david','anna'],
    'country':['USA','UK',np.nan]
})

df.query('country.isnull()')

This runs for me in pandas, it doesn't run for some of my teammates (whose installation process I don't control), but we have the same pandas version (1.3.4).
They get:
TypeError: 'Series' objects are mutable, thus they cannot be hashed

Can anybody help me understand why this code works differently on different computers?
Apparently, some people have this issue as well: blog.
