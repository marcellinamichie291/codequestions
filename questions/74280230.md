# CMake Error: Detected a mismatch for the compiler version between your conan profile settings and CMake

I have Debian 10.13, cmake 3.24, gcc 9.5, conan 1.53. I need recent gcc and recent cmake than available for Debian 10 to be able to use modern stuff against GLIBC 2.28. I compiled the gcc from source. When I run conan build command I get the following error:

CMake Error at build/conanbuildinfo.cmake:1950 (message): Detected a
mismatch for the compiler version between your conan profile settings
and CMake:
Compiler version specified in your conan profile: 8
Compiler version detected in CMake: 9.5
Please check your conan profile settings (conan profile show
[default|your_profile_name])

Command gcc -- version returns 9.5. In file ~/.conan/profiles/default a line is set to compiler.version=9. How can I fix the conan build? There is a similar question, but the only answer does not work for me.
