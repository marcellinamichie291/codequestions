# Is there a generic way to execute different python files, depending on sys.args?

I would like to create a python file that can be run from the terminal - this file will be in charge of running various other python files depending on the functionality required along with their required arguments, respectively. For example, this is the main file:
import sys
from midi_to_audio import arguments, run


files = ["midi_to_audio.py"]


def main(file, args):

    if file == "midi_to_audio.py":

        if len(args) != arguments:
            print("Incorrect argument length")
        else:
            run("test","t")


if __name__ == '__main__':

    sys.argv.pop(0)
    file = sys.argv[0]
    sys.argv.pop(0)

    if file not in files:
        print("File does not exist")

    else:
        main(file, sys.argv)

And this is the first file used in the example (midi_to_audio.py):
arguments = 2


def run(file, output_file):
    print("Ran this method")

So depending on which file I've specified when running the cmd via the terminal, it will go into a different file and call its run method. If the arguments are not as required in each file, it will not run
For example: >python main.py midi_to_audio.py file_name_here output_name_here
My problem is that, as I add more files with their own "arguments" and "run" functions, I wonder if python is going to get confused with which arguments or which run function to execute. Is there a more safer/generic way of doing this?
Also, is there a way of getting the names of the python files depending on which files I've imported? Because for now I have to import the file and manually add their file name to the files list in main.py
