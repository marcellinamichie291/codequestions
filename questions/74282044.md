So there's this data in a set of code on github that's specified as 1x500x666 where there are 666 timesteps and I'm assuming 500 bits of data for each timestep. They use orig_func_data_cell = cell(1, nsteps); to put it into a cell form for the number of steps, but I just wanted to figure out what the benefit of this was. I have my own data that's 20x100 (100 timesteps, 20 data points for each step) but I'm also not fully sure if I should put this into a cell, or how to do that when the original code is for 3-dimensional data? Could anyone help?
(Edit: for context, my data is basically values for the solution of the heat equation (u) on a grid of 100 timesteps and 20 x-steps, so I'm not sure how that helps explain what kind of cell I need, but it would be helpful if anyone could please explain. Thank you!)
