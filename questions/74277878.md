# adding rows based on values of other rows

I have a list (in a dataframe) that looks like this:
oddnum = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 23]

I want to create a new list that looks like this:
newlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 23]


I want to test if the distance between two numbers is 2 (if oddnum[index+1]-oddnum[index] == 2)

If the distance is 2, then I want to add the number following oddnum[index] and create a new list (oddnum[index] + 1)

If the distance is greater than two, keep the list as is


I keep getting key error because (I think) the list runs out of [index] and [index+1] no longer exists once it reaches the end of the list. How do I do this?
