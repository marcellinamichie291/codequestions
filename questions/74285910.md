I need to write a for loop in matlab that takes the first column of a 3xn matrice and prioritizes the smallest numbers. Essentially one of the inputs will be a number and that number is how many rows can have 1 as the output. I need the output=1 to be assigned to the smallest variables in the first column of thematrices.
It won't let me upload my code, says files too large
