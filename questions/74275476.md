# Pipes leading to "argument is not interpretable as logical" error?

I'm encountering a bit of an error I can't explain, I've got a bs_carousel using the bsplus library.
A working version of it is of this pattern:
bs_carousel("info") %>% bs_set_data(interval = FALSE) %>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image1, if(checker1 == 1){reactable(df1[,!(names(df1) %in% c("Day"))])}))%>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image2, if(checker2 == 1){reactable(df2[,!(names(df2) %in% c("Day"))])}))%>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image3, if(checker3 == 1){reactable(df3[,!(names(df3) %in% c("Day"))])})) 

However I need to put another condition in that shows each "bs_append" when a condition is met:
bs_carousel("info") %>% bs_set_data(interval = FALSE) %>% 
      if(dim(df1_checked)[1] != 0){bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image1, if(checker1 == 1){reactable(df1[,!(names(df1) %in% c("Day"))])}))}%>% 
      if(dim(df2_checked)[1] != 0){bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image2, if(checker2 == 1){reactable(df2[,!(names(df2) %in% c("Day"))])}))}%>% 
      if(dim(df3_checked)[1] != 0){bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image3, if(checker3 == 1){reactable(df3[,!(names(df3) %in% c("Day"))])}))} 

However for some reason, I get the following error:
Error in if (.) dim(df1_checked)[1] != 0 else { : 
  argument is not interpretable as logical

I don't think it's a data issue (therefore I haven't posted it yet), because when I put the entire bs_carousel in the same condition, it runs fine (or at least correctly for that conidition):
if(dim(df1_checked)[1] != 0){
bs_carousel("info") %>% bs_set_data(interval = FALSE) %>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image1, if(checker1 == 1){reactable(df1[,!(names(df1) %in% c("Day"))])}))%>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image2, if(checker2 == 1){reactable(df2[,!(names(df2) %in% c("Day"))])}))%>% 
  bs_append(bs_carousel_image(image3, if(checker3 == 1){reactable(df3[,!(names(df3) %in% c("Day"))])}))}

Is my syntax wrong, or am I missing something more fundamental?
Thanks for any advice
