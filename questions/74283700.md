When I have a
std::string s 

I can do
s.c_str() 

to convert it to a char* . As I understand it only adds a '\0' to the end of s.
Can I then conclude that just adding '\0' converts a string to a char * ?
Is doing something like that converting it to char* then ?
std::string s = "Hi ";
s[2] = '\0'

Does .c_str() convert all strings to their corresponding char* ? E.g.  for** std::string,    std::u8string,    std::wstring,   std::u16string,   std::u32string ? Does c_str() convert them to  char*,   char8_t*,   wchar_t*,   char16_t*,   char32_t* respectively ?
