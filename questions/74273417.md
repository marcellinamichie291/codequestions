I have a list of sentences, I need to add new line character and save in text file as the following format.
Note: I don't need new line character I want to keep in the given string format. I just want to keep \n and not get new line in text file
list:['Hi','I am xyz']
String Format:'Hi\nI am xyz'
If someone knows please let me know.
