# Structural pattern matching

One of the core changes in Python 3.10.x is the structural pattern matching feature.
A basic example of this new feature is the following:
>>> user = {
...     "name": {"first": "test_name", "last": "test_last"},
...     "title": "Python 3.10 is here!",
... }

>>> match user:
...     case {"name": {"first": first_name}}:
...         pass
...

>>> first_name
'test_name'

But this extraction can be done without structural pattern matching.
Can you give an example(s) of real word scenarios which can leverage the power of this new feature?
