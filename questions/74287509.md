# Npm, nvm, node not recognised in any shell

I have been trying to fix this issue for a while now and it's blocking me from doing any coding in VS code. I had to test a change I made to an emailer microservice and was told that I needed to use an older version of node, so I installed nvm and the older version of node, this didn't work for me but it's a separate issue right now, I just want to be able to run my nodejs apps for now.
I am on a work laptop and do not have admin access, I have to ask an admin to log in for me when I want to run cmd as administrator, which I need to do, so I can use the nvm commands.
The problem I have since installing nvm and running a different version of node, is that the terminal in VS code does not recognise npm commands so I cant even start my app using the terminal, even when I switch back to using the newer version. I had a look online and was advised to delete node and then reinstall using the nvm install command. This also didn't work, I think this has made it worse and installed node into the admins user account as I can't access the programs/nodejs file.
I also had a look at the path variables, the nvm_home, nvm_syslink, etc are all pointing towards files/folders in the admin users account, does this stop me from accessing those commands in the terminal?
Shall I just delete it nodejs, nvm and npm and then reinstall? I won't be able to work on the emailer, but at least I might be able to work on the other microservices
