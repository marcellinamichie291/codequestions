# Can i improve detection and decryption with opencv?

I am using pyzbar. Of the 13 images, he recognized and decoded 5. Can I improve the result by converting the images through opencv?
I know that there is a QrCodeDetector in opencv, but it does worse with recognition.
my code:
for i in imgs:
        image = i
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

        gradX = cv2.Sobel(gray, ddepth=cv2.CV_32F, dx=1, dy=0, ksize=-1)
        gradY = cv2.Sobel(gray, ddepth=cv2.CV_32F, dx=0, dy=1, ksize=-1)

        gradient = cv2.subtract(gradX, gradY)
        gradient = cv2.convertScaleAbs(gradient)
        blurred = cv2.blur(gradient, (9, 9))
        (_, thresh) = cv2.threshold(blurred, 225, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
        kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (21, 7))
        closed = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
        closed = cv2.erode(closed, None, iterations=1)
        closed = cv2.dilate(closed, None, iterations=1)
        (cnts, _) = cv2.findContours(closed.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,
                                     cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
        c = sorted(cnts, key=cv2.contourArea, reverse=True)[0]
       
        rect = cv2.minAreaRect(c)
        box = np.int0(cv2.boxPoints(rect))
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(box)
       
        if w <= 0 or h <= 0 or y <=0 or x<= 0:
            continue
        out = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        pyzbar.decode(out)
        cv2.drawContours(image, [box], -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)
        cv2.resize(image, (1410, 810))
        cv2.imshow("finalImg", image)
        cv2.waitKey(0)
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()

I thought that if I cut the qr codes from the image myself, then it would be easier for pyzbar to recognize and decipher them. But he began to recognize even fewer qr codes.
