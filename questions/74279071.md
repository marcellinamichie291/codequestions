# How to disable dependency if another dependency is not downloaded?

I have followind dependencies inside Chart.yaml:
  - name: opensearch
    version: 2.3.0
    repository: https://opensearch-project.github.io/helm-charts/
    condition: opensearch.enabled

  - name: opensearch-my-custom-configuration-app
    version: ^1.0.0
    repository: "@myrepo"
    condition: opensearch-my-custom-configuration-app

I want to prevent enabling opensearch-my-custom-configuration-app in case if opensearch.enabled is not enabled.
So combintaion
opensearch.enabled=false
opensearch-my-custom-configuration-app=true

should be considered as illegal and transformed to
opensearch.enabled=false
opensearch-my-custom-configuration-app=false

official documentation is very pure about it. https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/dependencies/#conditions-and-tags
How can I achieve it ?
