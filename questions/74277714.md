# Function/helper to lookup self from object

The API for value lookup exists on the collection, which makes sense and works in the vast majority of cases. Curious if an API exists to go the other way:
const store = {key: 1}
const getKey = () => "key" as (string | undefined) // might be compute-heavy
const result = store[getKey()] // undefined cannot be used as an index type. Can't do this.

const result = getKey() && store[getKey()] // needed to call getKey() twice here, meaning I can't inline efficiently

const result = getKey()?.valueIn(store) // would be awesome if this returned 1
valueIn(store) {store[self]} // under the hood
