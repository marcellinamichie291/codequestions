# How to ensure that a consumer resume from last read message from a specific Partition?

Below is our scenario:


where number of partitions is same as number of consumers
If any one consumer(say consumer 2 reading messages from Partition 2) is crashed or not operational,

What happens to unread messages stored in Partition2? Does other consumer pick it?

or

Messages in Partition2 are unread until consumer 2 restarts from the point it stopped reading(before crash)

Goal:

Message in any partition should not be read more than once by consumer group

Messages in every partition are being read in sequence amidst restart of consumer
