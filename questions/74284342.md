# Apply same content to multiple server blocks in nginx's default.conf file

I got nginxproxy from the docker hub and use it.
I want add a ddos defense to default.conf, which is automatically created in the nginxproxy container.
Since there are many domains, there are several server blocks.
server{
    server_name www.domain.com
}
server{
    server_name admin.domain.com
}
server{
    server_name api.domain.com
}

I want to apply the same information to all server blocks.
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ddos_req:10m rate=5r/s;
limit_req_status 404; 

server {
    # ...
    location /{
        limit_req zone=ddos_req;
    # ...
    }
}

Is it possible to divide and include files or apply the same to all servers with one code?
There is no http block in default.conf, what should I do?
