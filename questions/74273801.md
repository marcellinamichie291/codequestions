# Credit card address verifications of merchants in India

How credit card verification is working in Indian merchant sites, I have read about AVI, and will that compare the full address or only digits, is that the same process in India also. Do the merchants have manual access to our credit card address informations other than AVI score verification. Will our address information be private ?
