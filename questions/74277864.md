# How to correctly annotate a csv file for uploading into a bucket in InfluxDB

I am trying to evaluate InfluxDB as a real time, time series data visualization tool. I have an account with InfluDB and I have created a bucket for data storage.  I now want to upload a csv file into the bucket via the click to upload feature but I keep getting errors associated with incorrect annotations.  The last error I received was:
'Failed to upload the selected CSV: error in csv.from(): failed to read metadata: failed to read header row: wrong number of fields'
I have tried to decipher their docs and examples on how to annotate a csv file and have tried many different combinations of #datatype, #group and #default but nothing works.
This is the latest attempt that generated the error above.

#datatype,string,string,double,dateTime
#group,true,true,false,false
#default,,,,
_measurement,station,_value,_time

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
