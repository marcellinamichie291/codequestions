# Get data starting from the middle of the table

I have a question. I want to get data from the middle of the table. But the problem is I can't start from the middle. I have read that rownum can't be used for this. But i dont know how to do this with another method. Anyone have any clue how to do this? Thank you.
Below is an example.
select count(1) --9857
from time_day_dm
where rownum between 5000 and 9857
The output would be 0.
What i expect would be 4857.
