# Find the major element of the array

I'm stuck in this logic and I don't know how to solve it, I have the following question:
"Given a nums array of size n, return the majority element, that is, the element that appears the most times in your array."
And I have this code base:
`using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        
        int[] num = new int[n];

        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            num[i] = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        }
        Console.WriteLine(MajorityElement(num)); 
    }




    public static int MajorityElement(int[] nums)
    {
        int major = nums[0];
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
        {
            if ( )
            {
                major = nums[i];
                count++;
            }
            else
            {
                if (major == nums[i])
                {
                    count++;
                }
                else
                {
                    count--;
                }
            }
        }
        return major;
    }
}`

But I can't think of what the logic of the first IF would be.
How would that logic be in this question? And how would I solve it?
