# Private Media Using Google Cloud CDN

I have an application that uses the google bucket to store media, as there are many media, it was necessary to use the CDN service to reduce latency when loading them. However, when I use the CDN, the media is public and accessible to any unauthenticated person. Is there any way to cache the media and at the same time keep it private through an authentication token?
I tried in many ways following the documentation, keeping the Cache Type capturing the information from the Cache-Control header and the authorization token, but after caching the media it is accessible without the authentication token.
Can anybody help me?
