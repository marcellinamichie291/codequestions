# Are there any tools that exist to capture two DOMs and highlight the changes between them in an image? Or ideally in browser?

Usecase:
I need to make changes to the code in a POST request.  The api workings are rather opaque. It's unclear what I'm going to receive in return and how the DOM is going to change.
Would be nice to have a method to snapshot the DOM.  Then conduct a new code change, which re-bundles/serves, then reloads the DOM.  Take a second snapshot.  Then compare the two.  Does this exist?
