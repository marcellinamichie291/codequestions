I want to create a sidenav where the menu links will be placed next to icons. Note that each link has a different icon.
I tried to find an answer to this question here, but, unfortunately, this thread didn't give me clear understanding of which approach I should choose.
As far as I understand, it's better to use <img> if an image is a part of content (it may be image related to an article, advertisement etc.). While background-image should be used for decoration images, for example.
Accordingly, I should use background-image property, but in this case I will have to set bgi using nth-child(). Is it correct? It seems to me that placing different icons in <img> will be much more convenient.
