I'm trying to fetch items and customer accounts with the most recent transaction date.
Here is a sample table.
fruit     account  transaction_date
apple     123      11/01/2022
orange    123      10/31/2022
banana    123      10/30/2022
banana    456      11/01/2022
orange    456      10/31/2022
banana    789      10/29/2022
apple     789      10/20/2022
apple     1011     11/01/2022
banana    1011     10/31/2022

desired output.
fruit     account  transaction_date 
banana    456      11/01/2022
banana    789      10/29/2022

I tried using max transaction date but I get all accounts instead of just the two from the desired output. If the max date is not a banana it should not be on the result.
SELECT fruit, account, MAX(transaction_date) AS max_transaction date
  FROM tbl_test
 WHERE fruit = 'banana'
 GROUP BY fruit, account;
