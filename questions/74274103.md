I'm building a backend and a password is read on my html form using js and checked, then sends it in JSON format, I need to accept this data on the server and further parse it in the database, I don't understand how to do it, I was looking for long examples and ours are only in GIN, but I need to implement this without a framework.
type inputData struct {
        Login    string `json:"Login"`
        Password string `json:"Password"`
    }

    var id inputData

    err := c.BindJSON(&id)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err.Error())

        c.JSON(200, gin.H{
            "Error": err.Error(),
        })
        return
    }
