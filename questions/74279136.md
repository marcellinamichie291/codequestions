With df.replace able to replace pd.NaT with any value but np.nan/None
Note: I have to do multiple data transformations where I'd be using fillna('') which wont work on NaT and I don't want chained replace as it's bit expensive on massive dataframes.
I have a df (provided after dtype info)
ID                                                  int64
TYPE                                                 object
NAME                                                object
LOCATION_ID                                        float64
COUNTRY_ID                                         float64
REGION_ID                                          float64
SLA_TIME_TO_FIRST_RESPONSE_START_TIME       datetime64[ns]
SLA_TIME_TO_FIRST_RESPONSE_STOP_TIME        datetime64[ns]
SLA_TIME_TO_RESOLUTION_START_TIME           datetime64[ns]
SLA_TIME_TO_RESOLUTION_STOP_TIME            datetime64[ns]


df.replace(pd.NaT,np.nan)

Won't replace NaT to NaN

df.replace(pd.NaT, 'anything')

replaces NaT to 'anything'
