# Python Zero-Padding in Output Text File with "{0:+03f}".format() Not Working

I have created a program that calculates a variable-coefficient regression, and am attempting to output those coefficients to a text file. I am trying to use string formatting to pad zeros in order to have the output file line up correctly. The offending code is shown below:
output.write("N = 1 Regression:\n")
output.write("a    = {0:+03.6f}\n".format(T_fit_N1params[0]))
output.write("b1   = {0:+03.6f}\n".format(T_fit_N1params[1]))
output.write("tau1 = {0:+03.6f}\n".format(T_fit_N1params[2]))
output.write("R2   = {0:+03.6f}\n".format(R2(T_data, T_fit_N1)))

and its output is shown below:
N = 1 Regression:
a    = +11.685376
b1   = +75.493626
tau1 = +2.452343
R2   = +0.978152

I am instead expecting the following:
N = 1 Regression:
a    = +011.685376
b1   = +075.493626
tau1 = +002.452343
R2   = +000.978152

I know this is probably something simple, but I can't seem to figure it out even after visiting the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting
