# VBA Mass Find and Replace just wipes cells

Relatively simple problem. I have a huge spreadsheet full of product codes. I need to change about 200 of them. I have the below code. I am just testing this at the moment before using it on the live system. When I run the Macro it just deletes all the data in the cells on the other sheet rather than replacing it with the new product code in the second column. All help greatly appreciated.
Sub Multi_FindReplace()

Dim sht As Worksheet
Dim fndList As Integer
Dim rplcList As Integer
Dim tbl As ListObject
Dim myArray As Variant

  Set tbl = Worksheets("Sheet4").ListObjects("Table1")

  Set TempArray = tbl.DataBodyRange
  myArray = Application.Transpose(TempArray)
  
  fndList = 1
  rplcList = 2

  For x = LBound(myArray, 1) To UBound(myArray, 2)
      For Each sht In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
        If sht.Name <> tbl.Parent.Name Then
          
          sht.Cells.Replace What:=myArray(fndList, x), Replacement:=myArray(rplcList, x), _
            LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, MatchCase:=False, _
            SearchFormat:=False, ReplaceFormat:=False
        
        End If
      Next sht
  Next x

End Sub
