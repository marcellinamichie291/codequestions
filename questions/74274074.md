# Mailto link in MS Adaptive Card Action (Teams) opens new email window twice

I have set up an incoming webhook in MS Teams that includes an action to answer to the question posted via email. The answer email contains the question quoted with '>' at the beginning of each line.
The problem is that the email composer window opens twice as if I would click the button in Teams two times.
See the example code below.

When e.g. copying the mailto part into MS Word as a hyperlink and clicking it, the email composer window opens just one time. When clicking the button in the Adaptive card, it opens twice.
I could test this only with MS Outlook 365.
Can somebody spot where the culprit is?
