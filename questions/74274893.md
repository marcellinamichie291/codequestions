# github actions hides my jwt token retrieved from the backend

I have a CRON github action, which executes a python script.
First request goes well, the script gets jwt token from the backend.
Then when I am trying to do the second request, guarded by JwtGuard, the token is not attached in Authentication header.
I am logging the headers on backend and 'Authentication' header seems to be 'undefined'.
When I am trying to display jwtToken obtained from backend with Auth request, in Github Actions I can only see '***'.
What is the proper way to manage the token in github actions and attach it to the next requests properly?
