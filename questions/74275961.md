# antd select open upwards

i have modal in a fraction of the size of the full screen, inside the model I put a label of select antd, The problem is that it opens upwards instead of downwards.
When I add the open=true porps of select for enter css of antd and maybe try to edit it, It opens properly down and not up
here is my code:
 <Modal
bodyStyle={{ maxHeight: "90vh", minHeight: "75vh" }}>

      <Select
                    placeholder="bla"
                    style={{
                      minWidth: "140px",
                      fontSize:"11.5px",
                    }}
                    // open={true}
                    getPopupContainer={() =>document.getElementById('relativeSelect1')}
                    options={specialOptionQ1}
      />)

      <div id="relativeSelect1" style={{ position:"relative" }}/>
</Modal>

what can i change for this antd select option open dwonwards?
