# Python doesn't want to run function asynchronous

I just want to run async function like really async, but it blocks main thread for 5 seconds
import asyncio

async def sideTask():
    await asyncio.sleep(5)  # this will pause main thread for no reason
    print("doing side job")

global test

test = 0

# main work
while True:
    test += 1

    time.sleep(1)
    if test > 3:
        test = 0
        asyncio.run(sideTask())

I am expecting async function being async
