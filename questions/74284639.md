I try to plot two gggplots in same figure with shared legend from each plots. But what I receive is two plot but legend and fill color is from only one plot. How can I plot two plots together with shared legend and same fill color for unique value?
I tried plot_grid() and grid_arrange(). but result was not as expected.
