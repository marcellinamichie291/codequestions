# Problem Solving Array: How can i solve this problem?

Can anyone help me to solve this problem?
Let A [1..n] be an array that has the following property: ∃ 𝑖', 1 ≤ 𝑖 ′ ≤ 𝑛, such that
(∀𝑖: 1≤𝑖 <𝑖', A [i + 1] = 1 + A [i]) && (∀𝑗: 𝑖' ≤𝑗 <𝑛, 𝐴 [𝑗 + 1] = 𝐴 [𝑗] +2 ) The index element 𝑖' it is called boost.
Write the pseudocode of an efficient algorithm which, given a non-empty array A for which the above property holds, returns the boost (ie the index).
I was thinking to something like:
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  If((v[i + 1] != 1 + v[i]) && (v[i + 3] == 2 + v[i + 2]))
  return v[i + 1]
}

I know that it's almost certainly wrong but i didn't fully understand the problem.
