# array.push() in a for loop in an async function (IFC.js)

I am new in IFC.js and js.
My aim is to create a function that loads an IFC model through web-ifc-three loader, get all its ifcSpaces by getAllItemsOfType() and then push each ifcSpace to an empty array defined outside the function (spaceIDstoPush).
I think it is a syntax problem of async functions.
Thanks for any help!
When I run my script, the console shows an array that seems working but that seems to work but is actually empty... a sort of "fake array".
Here's the screeshot of my console, where 230, 377, 495, and 613 are the IDs of the ifcSpaces of the example.ifc model that I load.

Here's my script:
let spaceIDsToPush = [];

async function pushIfcSpaces(ifcUrl) {
  const ifcModel = await ifcLoader.loadAsync(ifcUrl);
  const ifcSpaces = await ifcLoader.ifcManager.getAllItemsOfType(0,IFCSPACE,false);
  
  for (let ifcSpace of ifcSpaces){
    spaceIDsToPush.push(ifcSpace);
  };

  }

pushIfcSpaces("../../IFC/example.ifc");

console.log(spaceIDsToPush);
