# Using pdfjs-dist on vercel (serverless function)

I'm trying to fetch and parse PDF file using the pdfjs-dist package in node runtime inside the Vercel Serverless Function.
Code (TypeScript):
import * as pdfjs from "pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf";
...

const document = await pdfjs.getDocument(url).promise;
...

Locally, when running vercel dev everything works OK. But after the deployment, when accessing the remote endpoint, I get following error:
Error: Setting up fake worker failed: \"Cannot find module './pdf.worker.js'
Any idea what can be causing this difference between local Vercel execution and the deployed version?

Local node version: v16.16
Vercel node version: 16.x
"pdfjs-dist": "^3.0.279"
