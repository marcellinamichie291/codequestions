# Why internationalization is not working on NextJS 13 using a [locale] sub-folder on app/

How to get i18n working on Next 13 ?
I have created a nested [locale]/ folder in app/ but it just gives a 404
See my next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: 'fr,
    locales: ['fr', 'en'],
    localeDetection: true
  }
}

Did you find a way to internationalize your app/ folder in NextJS v13 ?
EDIT:
On the beta.nextjs doc it says :

We are currently not planning to include the following features in app:
Internationalization (i18n)

I have as well found an open issue about it, which does not provide any workaround yet.
