I have a long list of dates (starting from 1942-1-1 00:00:00 to 2012-12-31 24:00:00. These are associated with some amounts respectively(see below). Is there a way to first filter all amounts for one day separately, and then add them up together?
For example for 1942-01-01, how to find all values(amounts) that occur in this day (from time 0 to 24) and then sum them together?
    time                    amount
        DateTime            Float64
    1942-01-01T00:00:00 7.0
    1942-01-02T00:00:00 0.2
    1942-01-03T00:00:00 2.1
    1942-01-04T00:00:00 3.0
        :
    2012-12-31T23:00:00 4.0
    2012-12-31T24:00:00 0.0



df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
for i in 1:24
filter(r ->hour(r.time) == i, df)
end
