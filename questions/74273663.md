I am trying to create a responsive navbar in angular which has a header text, Search bar, and some buttons.
When the screen size reduces the buttons kind of becomes like a dropdown like the outlook navbar.

Now when I reduce the screen size, the buttons enter dropdown.

The more I reduce the screen width, the more buttons go into dropdown

Is it possible to create such a behavior with only HTML CSS or any JavaScript functionality is required.
Any Suggestions on how to approach this issue?
I tried to implement with CSS alone. When the screen width reduces one button at a time should go into dropdown, but all the buttons are going into the dropdown.
