# Is it possible to deploy a smart contract with the complied abi json file using any flutter web3 package?

I'm trying to develop a Dapp with flutter. There I need to deploy a smart contract for each user to interact with when they sign up for the application. I explored the web3dart library and there were no functions to do that. I there any other library/ method to do that?
Edit: looking for a similar dart method to myContract.deploy(options) in web3.js. reference
