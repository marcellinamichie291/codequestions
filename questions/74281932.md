# Setting a periodic request to a Pythonanywhere server

I'm a bit new regarding coding and specially setting up servers and interacting with them. To learn, I wanted to practice how to interact with a remote server periodically. I took as an example the server https://darwincubansalsa.pythonanywhere.com/book_lesson, which accepts bookings once every week at a specific hour.
Aim:

To set a recurring process that sends a request to the https://darwincubansalsa.pythonanywhere.com/book_lesson domain every Sunday at 22:00 with the details of the booking.

Once I know a good way to set up the process I'll get into the details of the POST request. But first I would like to know what is the best option to set up a server for this simple task. I could think of using a free version of Pythonanywhere or even GitHub actions in a recurring manner. Setting up the server locally in my computer would not be the preferred way, given that they may be turned off during the opening window for requests.
Thank you in advance, everyone.
