# How to construct an alias with a command line variable inside a pair of double quotes?

Here is the command syntax. The format "name:/jsmith/" is literal and cannot be changed.
search -l "name:/jsmith/"

search -l "name:/jsmi.*/"

I am trying to create a bash alias that will take a command line variable ($1) as input like below:
alias new_search='search -l "name:/$1/"'

So the new search command would simply be:
new_search jsmith

new_search jsmi.*

Obviously the alias above is incorrect.
I understand that escape character helps preserving (" and /) and I also searched online and made some progress but the syntax below still fails.
alias new_search='search -l \"name:\/$1\/\"'

Any suggestions? Thanks!
