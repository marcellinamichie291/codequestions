# How to identify a unique client on the server side?

I'm new in backend, never worked with it before.
I want to add to my app authentication system: client asks server for unique ID, server generates about 5-6 symbols ID and return it to the client. The user can use this ID so others can find his device by it. After some delay (like few hours) server deletes unique ID so client has to ask for another one to continue using server services.
For my app this should be comfortable way - without any oauth systems. But what if someone wants to change client code so the same client will send thousands of requests to the server to create unique ID for it? It sounds really unsafe for server's database, it can be filled with fake IDs of the same device.
My questions are - is it possible to make request for creating ID safer like server checks if exactly this user already asked for ID before to reject this request? Maybe I can check something like client IP / MAC adress or something else? What's best practice for simular problems?
For more detailed context, I'm using Spring, Android SDK, Retrofit. Sorry for english, I'm not native speaker.
