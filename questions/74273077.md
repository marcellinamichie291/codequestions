# Angular 6 switch between Lazy Loading and Eager ('regular') loading using a flag on build-time

in our project we need to share the same codebase for 2 types of application (regular angular app and single-spa application). For regular app we use Lazy Loading modules, but for Single-spa we need to use a 'normal' loading with only one main.js file.
We have that flag specified in environment.ts so we know which app to load on build-time. Question is, how can we define how to load chunks without duplicating the routing arrays/files? Something like this:
{
        path: 'engage',
        loadChildren: isSSPA ? () => EngageModule :  './components/engage/engage.module#EngageModule',
      }

Thanks in advance!
ng-version:
"@angular/core": "^6.1.0",

ts-config:
"module": "esnext",

I've tried to isolate the modules so there's only one lazy loading route in use with the construction above, but it's not generating any chunks for modules even though flag is set to OFF:
