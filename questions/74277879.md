# Making dynamic pages in react

Let's say you have the following component "template1" which is a template for all the ids you want. But also let's assume there are several other of these templates as well as "home", "about us" etc. So let's say you have so many ids that it isn't feasible to make individual pages for them. How would you go about doing this in a scalable way? The way I am seeing it in my minds eye would be something like /template1/5Exo4a /template2/5Exo4a for the same id accross multiple templates or /template1/5Exo4a /template1/5A3z4a for same template but different ids.
I am using vite + react typescript and currently have my app.tsx set up like so. Where SidePanel selects the individual ids etc. So would I need to step up that functionality to the app.tsx? Or am I able to just pass the ids back somehow?
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        <SidePanel/>
        
        <Routes>          
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />}/>
          <Route path="/template1" element={<template1/>}/>
          <Route path="/template2" element={<template2/>}/>
          <Route path="/template3" element={<template3/>}/>
          <Route path="/template4" element={<template4/>}/>
          <Route path="/template5" element={<template5/>}/>

        </Routes>
        <SecondaryPanel/>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
