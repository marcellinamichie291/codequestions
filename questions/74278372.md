# SQL find values that occur in column once has specific value in another column

I'm trying to make an sql request that turned out surprisingly difficult to me (or maybe this is just the end of the day, sigh).
I have 3 tables:
Team:




id




1


2


3




Team member table:




id
team_id




1
1


2
1


3
1


4
1


5
2


6
2


7
2


8
2


9
3


10
3


11
3


12
3




Team member info table:




id
team_member_id
department_id




1
1
12


3
2
43


5
3
23


7
4
12


9
5
12


11
6
12


13
7
12


15
8
12


17
9
43


19
10
23


21
11
14


23
12
23




These tables are simplified, so don't pay much attention to its structure.
What I need to do is to get ids of teams which consists of members that belong to SINGLE department_id.
So in our example I need team(id=2) since it consists of members id=5,6,7,8 and all of them belong to department 12.
We don't need team 1 and team 3 since its members belong to multiple departments: (12, 43, 23) and (43, 23, 14) respectively.
Thanks a lot!
