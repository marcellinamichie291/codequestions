# Distance between Centroids of cluster and max data points

I want to detect anomaly using K-means clustering. when I am using fit method each data points comes under the given cluster. I want to see the point which is farthest from the centroids.
how can I get the maximum distance for each cluster define some fraction of distance beyond which I can assign the data as anomaly.


I have centroid for each clusters and I also have datapoints.
