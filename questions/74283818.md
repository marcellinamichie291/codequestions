# Building and linking .NET 4.8 from source code

I'm looking into an issue with an old ASP.NET WebForms solution. It's been upgraded to .NET 4.8 but the UrlAuthorizationModule seems broken on some level based on debugging I've been doing and I'd like to debug through the code. I've been trying to copy out code from UrlAuthorizationModule from System.Web and craft my own module but there's so many internal dependencies that I need to copy out and it's becoming a nightmare to complete. Got me thinking it would be better to just build .NET from source and link to my own custom built runtime that I could debug into, or just link to my own custom System.Web.dll over the default (if it's even realistic). The Microsoft Reference Source website has a dump of the .cs files and no projects and solutions so it's not in a buildable state. I'm struggling to find any links that don't point to .NET Core source guidance.
Has anyone gone to the effort of building the source of .NET Framework 4.8 that is available for us to use?
