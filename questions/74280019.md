Got stumped in this question while reading about neural networks in class. I'm absolutely unaware as to what might be the answer.
S&L can be random variables, how can someone figure out their relation?
I drew up a simple NN consisting of L layers and S nodes per each layer. I may be wrong which is why I'm clueless about it.
Edit : I have been given some numbers :

brain has 10^11 neurons
Each neuron has 1000 inputs and 1000 outputs.
