I've been trying to get a function to return a list of powers of five. The function takes parameter 'n' and returns 'n' number of powers of five. An empty list is appended with powers of five from 1 to 'n' such that when 0 is passed through for 'n' it returns empty square brackets. Seems simple. However, when I print the function for n = 2, I end up with a wonky result.
My function:
def powers_5(n):

    pwr_list = []

    nums = range(1, n + 1)
    
    for num in nums:
        pwr_list.append(num ** 5)

    return pwr_list

def main():

    print(powers_5(2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

I end up with the result:
[1, 32]

Where did I go wrong?
