# How to automatically fill in a Multi-Page Google Form?

I'm trying to automatically fill in a google form through a link, as seen in this post:
Auto-Fill or automate a Google Form
Is there any way to do this, or is there a better way to submit the form?
I tried following the above tutorial, along with trying to splice the two form responses created from submitting the two pages, I also tried going to both urls in sequence. Not sure what else to do, someone please help.
