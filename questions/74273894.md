# how to use local sqlite database along with firebase database android

In my app, I have SQLite/Room database. I want to introduce sync between the devices of my users.
I want to combine my local SQLite/Room DB with cloud Firebase DB.
I want my SQLite database to be stored on the Firebase Database when the users are logged in otherwise let it store offline. Any changes to the local database should be reflected on Firebase Database when logged in. Also if a user deletes the local database he/she can retrieve it from Firebase Database. I just want to use firebase for the synchronization between the local database and Firebase Database.
But I have no clue how to do it. Can anyone please help me with this? My app is in android with java as a backend.
I'm new so need your help.
