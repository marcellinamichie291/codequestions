# ConfigureServices in program.cs file?

I try to follow this link https://www.tektutorialshub.com/asp-net-core/asp-net-core-identity-tutorial/ to add Identity core for a asp.net core web mvc project. But it mention I should configure service for dependency injection (ConfigureServices) in my startup.cs file, but I only have a program.cs file... Can someone please help me out and tell me how I can do this in the program.cs file instead (if its supposed to be done there...)
