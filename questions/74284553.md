# How to create a bigquery external table with custom partitions

I would like to create a biggqury external table for data stored in:
gs://mybucket/market/US/v1/part-001.avro
gs://mybucket/market/US/v2/part-001.avro
...
gs://mybucket/market/CA/v1/part-001.avro
gs://mybucket/market/CA/v2/part-001.avro
...

With a table definition file
{
  "avroOptions": {
    "useAvroLogicalTypes": true
  },
  "hivePartitioningOptions": {
    "mode": "CUSTOM",
    "sourceUriPrefix": "gs://mybucket/market/{cc:STRING}/{version:STRING}"
  },
  "sourceFormat": "AVRO",
  "sourceUris": [
    "gs://mybucket/market/*/*/*.avro"
  ]
}

and a schema file:
[
  {
    "mode": "NULLABLE",
    "name": "id",
    "type": "STRING"
  },
  {
    "mode": "NULLABLE",
    "name": "name",
    "type": "STRING"
  },
  ...

The table is created with command:
bq mk --external_table_definition=tabledef.json ds.mytable schema.json

But when trying to query the table, following error is reported
Failed to expand table ds.mytable with file pattern gs://mybucket/market/*/*/*.avro: matched no files. File: gs://mybucket/market/*/*/*.avro

I also tried many variations as below, but none of them worked.
 gs://mybucket/market/*
 gs://mybucket/market/**.avro
 gs://mybucket/market/**/*.avro

Can anyone see what the problem might be?
Thanks
