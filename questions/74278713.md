# Select nth-child(n) except the first matching child

I want to select all elements matching nth-child(2n) in a list except for the first matching element; for example...


li:nth-child(2n) {
  background: red;
}

li:nth-child(2) {
  background: none;
}
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
  <li>Four</li>
  <li>Five</li>
  <li>Six</li>
  <li>Seven</li>
  <li>Eight</li>
  <li>Nine</li>
  <li>Ten</li>
</ul>



The result of this is that only Four, Six, Eight and Ten have a red background color.
I would like to know if there's a better way of expressing the CSS rules though, and if it's possible to express as a single rule:
li:nth-child(2n) {
    background: red;
}

li:nth-child(2) {
    background: none;
}

Can these be combined and still behave the same way?
