# How to filter api-gateway's requests in the same api-gateway?

I use a custom api-gateway (microservice) for microservices and my gateway has a service class (for handling and filtering REST requests and making them to gRPC requests to another microservice).
I also have a CustomGlobalFilter class for handling and filtering REST requests for other all microservices in my architecture. CustomGlobalFilter works good for routes (for other microservices), but it doesn't work for api-gateway's requests. Therefore I use two methods for filtering and handling requests, one is for all microservices, second is for api-gateway's requests. It works, but I want to handle and filter all microservices and api-gateway requests in one method.
I need to handle and filter all requests which come from front to all other microservices and handle api-gateway's it self requests also in one CustomGlobalFilter, but I failed.
Any suggestions? How can I do it? Thanks in advance.
We have tried to change @Order and endpoint-api.
