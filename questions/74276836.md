A program that takes two integers and produces and outputs a function that converts the results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two integers. However, a Segmentation Fault error occurs when the compilation is executed. I want to know the cause of the code.
An error appears even if you create and output addition, subtraction, and multiplication functions respectively.
