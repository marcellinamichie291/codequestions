# How to call React method from index.html

I am working on a web app that is in React with Typescript where I need to do certain things i.e. one of our system needs to communicate with our web app through a Javascript function. I will get certain data in the Javascript function (index.html). I need to call a react function from script tag in html. How can I do this.
I try to call, but it didn't worked.
<script>
function func1(filename){
 CallReactMethod(filename); //Not working
}
