# sum up a numeric string (1111 = 1+1+1+1=4)

#Develop a program that reads a four-digit integer from the user and displays the sum of the digits in the number. For example, if the user enters 3141 then your program should display 3+1+4+1=9.

ri = input("please enter four digits")
if len(ri) == 4 and ri.isnumeric() == True:
    print(ri[0]+ri[1]+ri[2]+ri[3])
else:
    print("Error: should be four digits!")

How do I do this? Haven't seen something like this before I'm sure, and as you can see my code fails....
