# The code snippet below is not printing the API response to the console is there something wrong here?

console.log() is not printing anything to the console and the alert of else is working so i know the flow of control is going there but nothing is printing to the console
useEffect(() => {
      axios
      .get(apiURL)
      .then((res) => {
        if(res.data.success === false && res.data.response === null)
          alert('API response is false (Trending Items)');
        else{
          alert('API response is true (Trending Items)')
          setApiData(res.data.response)
          console.log("Trending Items API response ----->" + res.data.response)
        }
      })
    },[])
