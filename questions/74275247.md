# Iterating over multiple cells with a find function

I have a google sheet that has multiple entries. These values match a certain field entry but there is an issue with the entries. They need to iterate with each of the values. Below is a picture of what Im trying to achieve. Below is a picture of the issue Im trying to conquer
Example of problem]
I need to match cells in red against the cells in blue to then descend in iteration i.e.
s006 = CD12A_TPE1210
s006_1 = CD12A_TPE1211
s006_2 = CD12A_TPE1212

The Reason I need to match red against the blue is because Im worried this spreadsheet may have some entries that aren't hard set to s006.
I tried the find and replace function with a COUNTIF/IF statement but Im struggling to get the matching separated from the replace part.
