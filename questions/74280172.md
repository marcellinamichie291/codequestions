# How to run a github action only on a specified folder?

I have a monorepo setup and I want to introduce CI/CD into it using Github actions. I want a separate workflow for each service. So far, I have figured out that you can use path filtering to limit when an action is run BUT I have yet to figure out how to have the action run only on a specified folder/path.
This is my current structure:
mono-repo --
            |
            |- services --
            |             |- service1
            |             |- service2
            |- .github --
                         |- workflows --
                                        |- service1.yaml
                                        |- service2.yaml  

Any help is deeply appreciated. Thank you in advance.
