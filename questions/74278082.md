# Ui path studio arguments? defined as variables or hard coded values

I was doing practice questions for the rpa asociate exam and came across a question I was unsure on how to answer.
Suppose you have some arguments from an invoked workflow. Some are out arguments, some are in and some are in/out. The question asked which types of arguments supported being mapped to variables and which supported being mapped to hard coded values.
I didn't find much on the documentation expect a generic paragraph on arguments as a whole that said that you could map them to both variables and hard coded values regardless of direction.
