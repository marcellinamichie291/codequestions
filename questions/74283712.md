how are you? I am using React and Firebase, what I want to do is to upload an image and bring it through the URL and have that URL in an object that has more information.  I have tried several ways and the only way that works is the one you see in the image. But it doesn't work as it should, the first object that goes up without the URL and the second one goes up with the URL of the previous one. And that's where I'm stuck.

I leave the github to see the full code if necessary.
Thanks in advance.

I have tried extracting the URL and storing it but it does not bring it up.
