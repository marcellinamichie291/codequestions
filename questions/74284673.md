# Get Web data with images

I am trying to extract the article body with images from this link. So far, I have tried this way.
t_link = 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/5-ways-to-reset-your-retirement-savings-and-save-more-money-in-2022.html'
page = requests.get(t_link)
soup_page = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')


html_article = soup_page.find_all("div", {"class": re.compile('ArticleBody-articleBody.?')})


for article_body in html_article: 
  print(article_body)

But unfortunately the article_body didn't show any image, like this.

So, how can I get article data with article images?
