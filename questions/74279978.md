# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'str' and 'bool' for DF filtering

I am trying to filter my dataframe such that when I create a new columnoutput, it displays the "medium" rating. My dataframe has str values, so I convert them to numbers based on a ranking system I have and then I filter out the maximum and minimum rating per row.
I am running into this error:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'str' and 'bool'

I've created a data frame that pulls str values from my csv file:
df = pdf.read_csv('csv path', usecols=['rating1','rating2','rating3'])

And my dataframe looks like this:
             rating1    rating2     rating3
0             D           D            C
1             C           B            A
2             B           B            B

I need it to look like this
             rating1    rating2     rating3    mediumrating
0             D           D            C           1
1             C           B            A           3
2             B           B            B           3

I have a mapping dictionary that converts the values to numbers.
ranking = {
         'D': 1, 'C':2, 'B': 3, 'A' : 4
         }

Below you can find the code I use to determine the "medium rating". Basically, if all the ratings are the same, you can pull the minimum rating. If two of the ratings are the same, pull in the lowest rating. If the three ratings differ, filter out the max rating and the min rating.
if df == df.loc[(['rating1'] == df['rating2'] & df['rating1'] == df['rating3'])]:
    df['mediumrating'] = df.replace(ranking).min(axis=1)
elif df == df.loc[(['rating1'] == df['rating2'] | df['rating1'] == df['rating3'] | df['rating2'] == df['rating3'])]:
    df['mediumrating'] = df.replace(ranking).min(axis=1)
else:
    df['mediumrating'] == df.loc[(df.replace(ranking) > df.replace(ranking).min(axis=1) & df.replace(ranking) 

Any help on my formatting or process would be welcomed!!
