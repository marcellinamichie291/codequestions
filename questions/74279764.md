# SQL Server 2017 Replacing Negative value without repeating long expression

I have a long expression which may return a positive, negative or zero decimal value.  I would like to do this:
SELECT CASE WHEN {long expression} < 0 THEN 0 ELSE {long expression} END

But I don't want to repeat the long expression.  I would like something like ISNULL, such as
SELECT ISNEGATIVE({long expression}, 0)

But that doesn't seem to be a thing.  Obviously GREATER would work but it's 2017.
I'm pretty sure I'm hosed, but was hoping for a miracle.  Anyone?
