# How to fix VS Code error while loading images?

Any time I try to use an image from my local machine, I get an error from VS Code saying "An error occurred while loading the image. Open file using vs code's standard text/binary editor."
The original drag and drop of the image into the file functions as in I can see the image in the text editor but if I click onto another file/folder and back onto the image file, I get this error. This is happening in this instance while trying to use a .ico file but it has been happening for about a week now with any image I try to use (.png, .ico, .jpg, etc...). I am on a Windows 10 machine and memory is not an issue.
I have tried disabling all extensions, replacing the file with another, making sure VS Code is up to date and completely closing VS Code and re-opening it.
