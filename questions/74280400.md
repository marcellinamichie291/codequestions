# Add New Event in Modern SharePoint Calendar

I have created a new calendar view from a SharePoint list and have enabled the attachments as well.
When I click + New from the top, I can see the attachment option, but on the other hand if I click + new on hovering my mouse from within the day cell in the calendar, there is no attachment option showing. Please help.
The attachment option is enabled.
