# How to disable Client-Initiated Renegotiation in SSL stream context in PHP

I'm trying to improve security in a piece of PHP code that uses the stream_context_create function to create a SSL-enabled listener. Testing tools show that Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation is allowed, which is unsafe. I would like to disable this.
I've checked the SSL context options and the stream_context_create manpages (and a lot of others) but could not find any references how to do this.
It looks like I need to set one of the low-level openssl SSL context options, but I don't know how to do that from the PHP streams context.
