# CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "Firebase/Database" [Geofire issue]

As there is constant update with firebase plugins I run into cocopod errors, what exactly is this error and how do I resolve this ?
I have had one before and resolved it but with newer packages and older plugins this error keeps popping up.
