# Nested dictionary value acts as a counter

I have the below code and am trying to generate a new dictionary of parameters. I would like the new dictionary to be a nested dictionary, and one of the nested keys be the most recent value, while the second nested key to be a counter that increases each time a value is updated.
options = {'threads' : '1', 'tolerance' : '1'}
options_2 = {'threads' : '2', 'timeout': True}

over_params = {}

def overrides_tracker(options, over_params):
    print(options)
    for k, v in options.items():
        over_params[k]['count'] += 1
        over_params[k]['value'] = v
        
    return over_params
        

over_params = overrides_tracker(options, over_params)
over_params = overrides_tracker(options_2, over_params)
        
print(over_params)

Right now my code is returning a KeyError. Is there an easier way to implement this sort of counter. Note that the value does not matter if the count of times that parameter is overridden is greater than 1. (That's why I don't mind just updating the value and replacing it.)
I would like for the resulting dictionary to look like this with the given inputs and function calls. (Note that the 'threads' key has a count value of 2.
{'threads': {'count': 2, 'value': '2'}, 
'tolerance': {'count': 1, 'value': '1'}, 
'timeout': {'count': 1, 'value': True}}
