# Python Config.ini Not Reading String

I am trying to build my first config.ini file for Python but having issues using it in my script. I am attempting to use it with the JIRA module for work so thats where I am hitting a snag. Before using a config file, when assigning a variable it would look something like this.
var1 = issue.fields.customfield10000

After trying to get my config.ini working, it looks like this
config = ConfigParser()
config.read(config.ini)

config_data = config['DEV']

var1 = issue.fields.config_data['item']

With this I get the error "'PropertyHolder' object has no attribute 'config_data'
Not really sure where to go from here, hope someone can help, thanks.
I have tried 'str(config_data['item']' and 'eval(config_data['item']' but both errored out for similar errors.
