# for loop with while loop wont break

# Initialized list of cities
CitiesInMichigan = ["Acme", "Albion", "Detroit", "Watervliet", "Coloma", "Saginaw", "Richland", "Glenn", "Midland",
                    "Brooklyn"]

# Get user input
inCity = input("Enter name of city: ")

# Write your test statement here to see if there is a match.
for i in range(len(CitiesInMichigan)):
    if CitiesInMichigan[i] == inCity:
        while CitiesInMichigan is True:
            print("City found. ")
            break
        else:
            print("Not a city in Michigan. ")
            input("Enter name of city: ")



# If the city is found, print "City found."

# Otherwise, "Not a city in Michigan" message should be printed.

So what I am trying to go for was to have the input case insensitive so (Acme, ACME, acMe, etc.) would work
and to have it break if input matches or try again if input is false.
Instead I have been receiving that all inputs are not a city of Michigan.
What am I doing wrong?
P.S I am studying python for school and as a passion, I am still new and wrapping my head around it please criticize anything I do wrong to further improve my codings.
Thank you
