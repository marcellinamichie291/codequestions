# Total number of resources that need to be loaded for the given URL

I have some question related to splitting url.

I want to find out that how many resources is need for a url to load it fully.
how much time it will take for each resources. e.g how much time image will take to be full loaded how much time will content take to be fully loaded.
if i only pass images will the url will load full or if i pass only content (mean some byte of the data) will it load fully.

the full question is below::
For each valid URL, you should check whether each of its resources is splittable, i.e., it can
be loaded in parts by sending multiple HTTP requests. In addition, you should collect the
following information about each URL:
• Total number of resources that need to be loaded for the given URL.
• Number of resources that are splittable. Which HTTP methods support the fetching
of splittable resources?^
