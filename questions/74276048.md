# iOS universal link with url path containing "#!"

My iOS app has to support a universal link to a page something like
https://example.com/#!/game/home
And I am having difficulties in getting this to work. I have created an AASA file like
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [{
            "appID": "ASDF35SDF.ios.mybundle.com",
            "components": [{
                "/": "/#!/courses/*/home"
            }]
        }]
    }
}

I also tried with wildcards instead of directly adding "#!" in the AASA file.
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [{
            "appID": "ASDF35SDF.ios.mybundle.com",
            "components": [{
                "/": "/*/courses/*/home"
            }]
        }]
    }
}

Both didn't work. I have verified that my AASA file is correctly read (server logs). I have other paths without "#!" in the AASA file which are working correctly (thus making sure my AASA file is read correctly).
Any help is appreciated.
