# What is the proper way of implementing Angular template-driven sub-forms?

In an Angular project we have a model class like this:
export class Contract {

  amount!: number;

  // Contractual parties
  beneficiary: Party = new Party();
  applicant: Party = new Party();
}


export class Party {
  name!: string;
  streetAndNumber!: string;
  zipCode!: string;
  city!: string;
}

and a form to capture Contract data:
<form #form="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="save()">
   <mat-form-field> 
     <input matInput id="amount" name="amount" placeholder="Amount" required type="number"
               [(ngModel)]="contract.amount">
   </mat-form-field>
               
    <party-details-form
                        [party]="contract.beneficiary"
                        [label]="'Beneficiary'">
        </party-details-form>
    
    <party-details-form
                        [party]="contract.applicant"
                        [label]="'Applicant'">
        </party-details-form>
    
    
    <button mat-button type="submit" [disabled]="form.invalid">Next</button>
</form>

Which means we tried to define a reusable sub-form component to capture the Party data for each party (instead of redundantly defining the same form controls for each party). The party-details-form component looks like this:
@Component({
  selector: 'party-details-form',
  templateUrl: './party-details-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./party-details-form.component.scss']
})
export class PartyDetailsFormComponent {

  @Input() party: Party = new Party();
  @Input() label: string = "";
}

and its template is:
<div>
    <mat-form-field>
        <label for="partyName">{{ label }}</label>
        <input matInput id="partyName" name="partyName"
             required [(ngModel)]="party.name">
    </mat-form-field>
    
    <mat-form-field>
      <input matInput id="partyStreetAndNumber" name="partyStreetAndNumber"
             required [(ngModel)]="party.streetAndNumber">
    </mat-form-field>

    <mat-form-field class="zipCode">
      <input matInput id="zipCode" name="zipCode"
             required [(ngModel)]="party.zipCode">
    </mat-form-field>

    <mat-form-field class="city">
      <input matInput id="city" name="city"
             required [(ngModel)]="party.city">
    </mat-form-field>
</div>

This works fine except for one issue: All the fields in the party-details-form template are declared as required. However, the form in the parent component does not seem to know about them, i.e. does not validate the 'required' rule. So the submit button is enabled even if the party data is missing.
All the solutions I've found on the internet (such as this or this) look to me like hacks or workarounds.
I mean, defining a reusable sub-form component that can be used many times in a parent-form seems to me as such a common need that I would expect Angular to have a simple and clean way of doing it. What would you recommend?
A second question is how would you make the ids of the sub-form controls unique within the parent form?
