# My break statement unintentionally interrupt my loop, how should I fix it?

I was looping some music notes and wanted it to stop looping when I enter. However, the loop cycle stops when it encounters the code:
stop = gets
if stop == "\n"
    puts "You have stopped listening, どうして？"
    break
end`

that only intended to break when receive the 'enter' input
Here is the full code:

a=0
loop do
    if a+=1
        puts "♪"
        sleep(0.1)
    end
    if a+=2
        puts " ♫"
        sleep(0.2)
    end
    if a+=3
        puts"   ♪"
        sleep(0.3)
    end
    if a+=4
        puts"    ♫"
        sleep(0.4)
    end
    if a+=5
        puts"     ♪"
        sleep(0.5)
    end
    if a+=6
        puts"    ♪"
        sleep(0.6)
    end
    if a+=7
        puts"  ♪"
        sleep(0.5)
    end
    if a+=8
        puts"♪"
        sleep(0.4)
    end
stop = gets
  if stop == "\n"
    puts "You have stopped listening, どうして？"
    break
  end
end


I hope you gentlemen and ladies passing by could look into this and I wish you a good day!
I know the loop stopped after a+=8 because it ran into the break command, thus, I tried isolate the code block containing break but it was not the way..
