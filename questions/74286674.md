# Preview of math formulars in ASCiiDoc (VS Code)

I am using VS Code to write a document in ASCiiDoc. Part of this document are math formulas.
My problem is that preview of this formulars does not work.  For example: If I write
latexmath:[\alpha(t_i)] 

the preview is
(\alpha(t_i)).
In Git intepretation of this works, but not locally in preview. How do I fix this?
