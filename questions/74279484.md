# XCUI - Load a file from folder(mac) to iOS simulator/test device during test

I'm trying to write some auto-tests to application, to test it the right way i have to get some files (that i have to get on my iOS device/simulator), after that, do some tests and delete the files at the end(thats important),i have the right files in the folder where my tests located on my mac, the question is - Is it possible to load some files from myproject/uiTestsFolder into specific folder on test iOS device/simulator during test execution? If so - How?
I was trying to do it with Swift File Manager inside my test method, but haven't found the right solution. Could you please share if there is one.
