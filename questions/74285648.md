# Azure devops repo can not integrate with codeanywhere

i have export ssh public key from codeanywhere and import to azure devops, but when to use the git clone url from azure repo to import to codeanywhere, there will be an error from codeanywhere as below:
"Request createProjectFromGit failed with message: Cloning into 'repo002'...
Host key verification failed.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists."
The same method, i can able to launch online ide for github, gitlab, and bitbucker repo. but only azure repo i can not make it. Or azure repo will be a close box and can not access to another third party ide.
