# Automate Apigee API Proxy Deployment in CI/CD Pipeline

Is there any recommended method to create and deploy the Apigee API Proxy Bundle via a CI/CD pipeline (I'm using Azure DevOps)?
I want to avoid excessive API Proxy Bundles from being created and deployed when there are no changes to be made. I've already tested, and I see that identical bundles still create a new revision.
So far, my own solution is to write a PowerShell script to use apigeecli to download the current bundle and compare it against the apiproxy that I have locally in my repo. If it differs, I create and deploy a new API Proxy Bundle.
Has anyone seen anything better?
