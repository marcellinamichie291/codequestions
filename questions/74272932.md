# How to get all policy but only contain object and action without subject

casbin has method to get all policy by running this code:
Enforcer.GetPolicy()

the return data would be something like this:
[
    [
      "superadmin", // subject
      "user",       // object
      "create"      // action
    ],
    [
      "superadmin",
      "user",
      "read"
    ],
    [
      "admin",
      "user",
      "read"
    ]
]

is there any method to get data without the subject so the data I get would be something like this:
[
    [
      "user",       // object
      "create"      // action
    ],
    [
      "user",
      "read"
    ],
]
