# Google Play - migrating from APK to AAB - partial rollout does not work

We have an Android app built in 2020, we regularly update it by generating and uploading APKs. We always start with partial rollout (50% of audience etc.) in case something goes wrong and we can cancel this rollout.
Now we created AAB instead of APK, uploaded it, got approved, and started partial rollout (99% of audience). However, Play Store keeps suggesting old version to users (new users keep installing old version, old users keep using old version and 0 people have upgraded. We see this from stats)
We have lots of traffic (50k installs daily), so we would definitely notice if someone upgraded.
Why is that? Has anybody encountered this? It seems to me that partial rollout does not work while upgrading from APK to AAB, am I right?
