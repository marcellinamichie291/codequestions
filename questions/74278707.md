# Need help to automate folder and subfolder creation in VBA?

I have a folder with two excel sheets in it.
In the first sheet is a column with a long list of tags that get added to over time. I have made a macro that creates a folder based on selecting a cell.
Now I would like another macro that adds a subfolder into this folder this selection-created folder. Furthermore, In this selection-created folder I would like the macro to copy the other excel sheet from the first folder into.
My issue lies in that the first macro-created folder is new and therefor I need some way to identify this folder in order to create the subfolder rates and then put in the other excel file into it.
I hope that makes sense and thank you very much in advance :)
