# How to arrange react native's blocks dynamically?

I'm creating an app which is use content form Strapi cms. There are different blocks with different layout so I divide these block into components and each block is corresponding to a block of content in the cms. The question is how can I arrange these block in app according to the order of block content on strapi? I thought about order property but it seems to be not exist in react native.
