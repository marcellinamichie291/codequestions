# AWS .net SDK S3 gives the Error when try to access object with Bidirectional (Unicode) characters

We are uploaded one file using AWS SDK for JavaScript v2.727.1 with key “156-50191-55215f17-0718-4713-b0d4-3bcb8b401d71/Enterprise/Documents/156/Directories/kyoScan-‎10‎.‎31‎.‎2022-‎0‎.‎07‎.‎44_685_202210311112484.pdf” and its successfully uploaded but when we try to fetch the file information using S3FileInfo its gives the error below :
Target resource path [156-50191-55215f17-0718-4713-b0d4-3bcb8b401d71/Enterprise/Documents/156/Directories/kyoScan-‎10‎.‎31‎.‎2022-‎0‎.‎07‎.‎44_685_202210311112484.pdf] has bidirectional characters, which are not supportedby System.Uri and thus cannot be handled by the .NET SDK.
Currently we our Portal is using framework 4.6.1 and using AWSSDK.S3, Version=3.3.0.0
We try to check solution and found one solution that framework 4.7.2 but we are not able to upgrade our framework due to some reason.
