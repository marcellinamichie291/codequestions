# Micronaut: Graalvm: Native image tracing agent not working

I have been developing MS in Micronaut, which I want to run as Graalvm native image on AWS Lambda. I have few dependencies like Jackson ObjectMapper, Apache POI, etc. in the project which does use reflection framework. But, Graalvm doesn't support reflection framework out of the box. So, we need to provide the configuration for the classes which are using reflection framework. To generate such configuration, I am trying to use Graalvm tracing agent, but it doesn't seems to be working.

It generates the config JSON files successfully.
But these config JSONs doesn't contain the classes from 3rd party libs which are added in build.gradle.
I have below parameter in gradle.properties file:

org.gradle.jvmargs=-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=<path to dir>


Then, I run the project using gradle's run task from the IntelliJ, and do execute all the methods which actually use these libs (thus all those libs' code gets executed).
Once the execution is stopped, I find few config files generated on the dir path mentioned, but those files contains only classes related to Gradle, Jetbrains and few others. I cannot find any classes related to 3rd party libs which I am using and which are mentioned in build.gradle.

What should be the correct way to generate the reflection configuration JSON file for Micronaut Graalvm native image?
