# ggplot: customise x axis spacing when x is a factor

I have a plot from ggplot, where I am comparing two groups over time:

It was generated from a linear mixed effects model:
lme(pain ~  AssNo * Trt_Grp,
                random = list(~AssNo | Pat_TNO,
                              ~1 | recruitcent),
                data = ehp30_calc,
                na.action = na.omit) %>%
  emmeans(specs = "Trt_Grp", by = "AssNo") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AssNo, ymin = lower.CL, y = emmean, ymax = upper.CL, col = Trt_Grp, group = Trt_Grp)) +
  geom_errorbar(size = 1, width = 0.2, position = "dodge") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylim(0, 100) + 
  xlab("Assessment") +
  ylab("Pain from EHP30") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue"), name = "Group")

In the data, AssNo is the time variable and is a factor.
My time points are categorical variables (factors), but they are not equally spaced (baseline, 6 month, 1 year, then yearly until 3 years). Is there any way of changing the spacing of the x axis to reflect the unequal spacing in time?
