# No solution in OR-Tools, compared to Chuffed in two seconds

For my thesis I am making a simple schedule model. A small section of the code can be found below. The model aims to connect a set of specialized workers to a shift based on the required workload on time t. For now, this is a pure satisfaction problem.
Model:
enum employees; % all employees
set of employees: runnersPrimary; % runners employees
array[positions] of float: positionsRatio; % 50% of workload should be runners

% General labels
enum positions = {bar, runner, kitchen, free};
set of employees: emergencyResponseOfficer;

% Contract hours
array[employees] of int: contractHours;

% Workload requested
set of int: shiftLength = 1..(7*24); % one week schedule, scheduled per hour
array[shiftLength] of int: workload;

% Settings
int: minShiftLength = 3;
int: maxShiftLength = 8;

% Target variable
array[employees, shiftLength] of var positions: empToShift;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Support variables %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
array[shiftLength] of int: runnerLoad = [round(workload[s] * positionsRatio[runner]) | s in shiftLength];
set of positions: runnerAllowed = {runner, free}; % either working or not working

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Hard requirements %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Nobody working when store is closed
constraint forall(e in employees, s in shiftLength where workload[s] = 0)(empToShift[e,s] = free);

% Employees with fixed contract hours should work atleast contracthours
constraint forall(e in employees where contractHours[e] > 0)(
   sum(s in shiftLength)(empToShift[e, s] != free) >= contractHours[e] 
   /\ sum(s in shiftLength)(empToShift[e, s] != free) <= (contractHours[e] + 8)
);

% Min and max shift length
constraint forall(e in employees, s in 1..(length(shiftLength) - 3) 
                  where workload[s+1] > 0 /\ empToShift[e,s] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+1] != free)( 
  empToShift[e,s+2] != free /\ empToShift[e,s+3] != free
);    
           
constraint forall(e in employees, s in 1..(length(shiftLength) - (maxShiftLength+1)) 
                  where workload[s+1] > 0 /\ empToShift[e,s] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+1] != free)(
  empToShift[e,s+9] = free
); 

% Atleast 12 hours off after a shift
constraint forall(e in employees, s in 1..(length(shiftLength) - 12) 
                  where empToShift[e,s] != free /\ empToShift[e,s+1] = free) (
  empToShift[e,s+2] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+3] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+4] = free /\ 
  empToShift[e,s+5] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+6] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+7] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+8] = free /\ 
  empToShift[e,s+9] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+10] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+11] = free /\ empToShift[e,s+12] = free
);

% Employees can only work in assigned departments
include "member.mzn";
constraint forall(e in runnersPrimary, s in shiftLength)(member(runnerAllowed, empToShift[e,s]));

% Load at department should approximate target
constraint forall(s in shiftLength)(
  sum(e in runnersPrimary where runnerLoad[s] = 0)(empToShift[e,s] = runner) = 0
  /\ sum(e in runnersPrimary where runnerLoad[s] != 0)(empToShift[e,s] = runner) = runnerLoad[s]
);

solve satisfy;

With Chuffed a solution can be found within two seconds whereas OR-Tools can not find a solution at all. Clearly there is a problem with the model. What should be changed in order to make it find a solution within reasonable time?
