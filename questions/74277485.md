# How to display least and most expensive from array in Java

So I have an array of 15 Flying Objects, The flyingObjects class consists of 1 variable (Price: Double) with its getters and setters.
I also have an airplane class that extends FlyingObjects, a helicopter class that extends Airplane and quadrotor and multirotor class that extends helicopter. On the other side of the tree I have a UAV class that extends FlyingObjects, a MAV class that extends UAV and a AD class that extends UAV.
Here is the array:
    FlyingObjects [] test = new FlyingObjects[7];
    test[0] = new Uav(10,43);
    test[1] = new AgriculturalDrone(8000,780000,"Chase",2400);
    test[2] = new Uav(10,5);
    test[3] = new Mav(0.5,140000,"trooper",10);
    test[4] = new Multirotor("Hexa",140000,200,185,2021,1,4);
    test[5] = new Helicopter("Robinson",199000,250,100,2018,7);
    test[6] = new Airplane("Boeing",350000,450);

Now I need to write a method that will get me the most expensive and least expensive UAV in my array (note that the price is always the second attribute in the UAV's constructors).
for some reason my method always return the first UAV in the array as the least expensive and the last UAV in the array as the most expensive.
Any tip on how to fix this issue?
    public static void findLeastAndMostExpensiveUAV(FlyingObjects[] flyingObjects) {
    int mostExpensive = -1;
    int leastExpensive =1000000000;
    boolean hasUav = false;
    
    if(flyingObjects == null) {
        System.out.println("There is no UAV");
    }
    for(int i = 0;i<flyingObjects.length;i++) {
        if (flyingObjects[i] instanceof Uav) {
          Uav a = (Uav) flyingObjects[i];
          if (a.getPrice() >= mostExpensive) {
              mostExpensive = i;
          }if (a.getPrice() <= leastExpensive){
              leastExpensive = i;

          }
          if(!hasUav) {
              hasUav = true;
          }
        }
    }
    if(!hasUav) {
        System.out.println("There is no UAV");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("\nInformation about the most expensive UAV: \n"+ flyingObjects[mostExpensive]+"\n");
        System.out.println("Information about the least expensive UAV: \n"+flyingObjects[leastExpensive]);
    }
}
