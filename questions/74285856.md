I am appending three text files into one file while doing that there's an extra line coming up at the end of the new file.
Please let me know how to avoid that?
This is the command which I'm using: cat $PRETEXT $TMPFILE $POSTTEXT> Outputfile.txt
Output which I'm getting is:
file1
file2
file3
----(new line here)
