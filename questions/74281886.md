# How do I get a Double with a default value to be blank/empty in a form field in SwiftUI?

I've got a form in SwiftUI where one of the fields in a Double.
If I set @State private var qty: Double = 0 then the form field, naturally, has a default of 0. But when adding a new item, I want that field to just be blank.

If I just remove the default and make it @State private var qty: Double, then an error is thrown.
