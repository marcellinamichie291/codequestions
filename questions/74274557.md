# Are there any downsides in using the CDKToolkit's cloudformation execution role for cross account deployments?

This is the role generated by cdk bootstrap. It has admin functions by default and can be configured to be assumed by certain accounts, by supplying the --trust in bootstrap.
In our use case, our pipelines stages will assume this role and execute the cross account deployments.
My worry with using it as an umbrella role for all cross stack deployments is the openness it allows. Anyone can create a pipeline and just assume it and create/update any stack in any account.
I thought maybe I'm missing something. Because even with the CDK Pipelines, this behavior is baked in, and seemingly not customizable.
I thought the better way is to have a customized role per cross account per stack deployments. That way, it's limited on which pipeline can assume the role, and what account and stack it can touch.
Are there any reasons NOT to use this? Are there any downsides/upsides to it?
