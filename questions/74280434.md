# cumsum does not reset in new groups and gets computed regardless the groupby column

I have the following dataframe called classDailyExam. It shows per each class, how many exams were taken daily.

Based on this I want to compute the number of total exam taken until each day. I have this code for this purpose:
classDailyExam.groupby(level=0)['count'].cumsum()

This code produces this output :

At first look, it seems fine. However, when I scroll to the next ClassId value, the cumsum actually is not reset for the next ClassId. I mean cumsum is computed for the whole data regardless the ClassId.

Any ideas why this might be happening?
