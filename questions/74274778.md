# SSH times out when trying to connect

A few days ago i was rsyncing files to my server but it suddenly froze. Then i noticed that my SSH session also froze. When i tried sshing back it froze once again. Today my friend wanted me to ssh into his server so he made me a user gave it a password etc... (Note that he has succesfully ssh-ed in and sshd is running on port 22) but when i tried to connect it froze once again so i ran the command again with:
-vvv

The output is:
OpenSSH_9.1p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1q  5 Jul 2022
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug2: resolve_canonicalize: hostname <the ip address of the server> is address
debug3: expanded UserKnownHostsFile '~/.ssh/known_hosts' -> '/home/anon/.ssh/known_hosts'
debug3: expanded UserKnownHostsFile '~/.ssh/known_hosts2' -> '/home/anon/.ssh/known_hosts2'
debug3: ssh_connect_direct: entering

debug3: set_sock_tos: set socket 3 IP_TOS 0x48
debug1: connect to address ip port 22: Connection timed out
ssh: connect to host ip port 22: Connection timed out

That is the info i was able to gather but here is some general system info:
Os: arch (freshly updated)
I haven't tried much apart from updating my system since i am not an expert at SSH.
