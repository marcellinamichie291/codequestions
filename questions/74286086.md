# Issue with Unmarshalling GRPC Response To Generic Type

I am trying to use generics to convert a JSON object into a GRPC response that has an enum, i.e.:
type GRPCResponse {
    str string
    enu EnumType
}

type EnumType int32
const (
    Type1 EnumType = 0
    Type2 EnumType = 1
)

The function for unmarshalling looks like this:
func assertHTTPResponseOK[T any](t *testing.T, endpoint string) T {
    body, err := GetResponse(endpoint)

    var v T
    err := json.Unmarshal(body, &v)
    require.Nil(t, err)
    return v
}

And the code calling it looks like this:
assertHTTPResponseOK[*GRPCResponse](t, "some-endpoint")

The JSON object in question looks like this:
{"str":"hello", "enu": "Type2"}

and I am getting an error along the lines of:
json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field GRPCResponse.enu of type EnumType

From similar questions, I have seen that the usual advice is to use jsonpb.Unmarshal or protojson.Unmarshal instead of the typical json.Unmarshal.
In changing the Unmarshal function, I also had to change T to be protoreflect.ProtoMessage. However, this prevents me from passing a pointer to v to Unmarshal, because it is a pointer to the interface, not the interface. Of course, I also cannot pass in a nil pointer (not take the address of v).
So my questions are:

Is there a way to have the pointer of this generic object satisfy the interface protoreflect.ProtoMessage?
Is there a better Unmarshalling function that would better fit my problem?
