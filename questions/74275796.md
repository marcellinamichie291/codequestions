# How to fix defunct processes caused by nested shell executions

I have a resident Python that receives a request to execute a certain shell script (using poll to see if the child process has ended).
// agent.py
oProc = subprocess.Popen(script, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
nStartTime = time.time()
while oProc.poll() is None:
            if (timeout > 0) and (time.time() - nStartTime) > timeout:
                logger.debug("script:%s,time out..." % script)
                self.KillAll(oProc.pid)
                break

There is a shell A script where a command takes a long time to execute, so the command is executed in the background, but this causes shell A to become defunct and python print debug script:xxx time out... which is the debug output from python as above
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      4300     1  0 Sep01 ?        00:07:03 /usr/python/bin/python /xxx/agent.py start
...
root     13399 12538  0 19:26 ?        00:00:00 [test_script] <defunct>
...
root      9658     1  0 19:21 ?        00:00:00 /bin/bash /home/xxx/script_of_running_longtime.sh

test_script.sh executed by python
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit
set -o pipefail
...
...

nohup /home/xxx/script_of_running_longtime.sh &
...

script_of_running_longtime.sh
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit
set -o pipefail
...
...
some command
...

I would like to know what is causing this problem and how I can fix it. I really appreciate any help with this.

agent.py is a third party service and cannot be modified
