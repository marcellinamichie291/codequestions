# Hey got a Perlin noise creator in python and need any help for improvements or but testing. here it is

import math
import random

def CreateRandomArray(size):
    Array = []
    for i in range(size):
        Array.append(random.randint(0, 100))
    return Array
def Inturpulate(Array):
    for i in range(0, len(Array)):
        if(Array[i] < 50):
            Array[i] = 0
        elif(Array[i] > 50):
            Array[i] = 1
    return Array
Array = CreateRandomArray(9000)
PerlinNoise = Inturpulate(Array)

for i in range(0, len(PerlinNoise)):
    if(PerlinNoise[i] == 1):
        PerlinNoise[i] = "[]"
print(PerlinNoise)

I made this simple perlin noise generator, it can get any size and it needs to be inturpulated by the function before use, most of the time works, even with huge numbers like 9000, generates a list of 1s and 0s for you to use. Please try this out, i was working really hard on this. please please please, good luck coders...
