# MYSQL query causes a blank page instead of the form showing

This query is causing my page to come up blank.  When I comment out these three lines the form loads.
$sql = "SELECT * FROM User_Hero_Portrait WHERE username='$username' AND 
Hero_Name='$heroname'";
$result = $db->query($sql);
$data = $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);  

I have another query on the same page that works just fine.  That code is:
$sql2 = "SELECT * FROM Ascend_Levels ORDER BY Ascend_Sort";
$result2 = $db->query($sql2);
$data2 = $result2->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);

I've also tried this code, but it also causes the page to come up blank.
$sql = "SELECT * FROM User_Hero_Portrait WHERE username='$username' AND 
Hero_Name='$heroname'";
$result = mysqli_query($db, $sql);
$data = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);

Thanks in advance.
