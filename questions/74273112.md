I found in Python there are two ways to represent the dimension of a '1D' array, namely (p, ) and (p, 1), in which 'p' is number of elements in an array. How can I determine if an argument is the former case or the latter case? The following is an example:
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x.shape) # (3,)

x2 = np.random.rand(3, 1)
print(x2.shape) # (3, 1)

If I use 'shape[1] to detect whether the argument has the second dimension, there will be an error since the argument might be the first case. How can I determine the argument is the former case without having an error?
