# Specify 'using static' only for debug build in blazor

In my blazor app, I use using static to simplify console logging:
_Layout.razor:
@using static System.Console

SomeComponent.razor:
WriteLine("foo");       // instead of Console.WriteLine("foo");

I want that only in DEBUG builds, but I cannot use #if DEBUG in a _Layout.razor file.
Is there some way to include it only for DEBUG, or perhaps a way to include a _LayoutDebug.razor file only for DEBUG?
