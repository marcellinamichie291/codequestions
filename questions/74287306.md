# how to stop thread in ExecutorService

ExecutorService executor = ****;
List<List<Object>> objectGroup = Lists.partition(objectList, 5);
for (List<Object> eachGroup : objectGroup ) {
            CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(eachGroup.size());
            for (Object obj: eachGroup) {
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    doTask(obj);
                    latch.countDown();
                });
            }

            try {
                if (!latch.await(15, TimeUnit.MINUTES)) {
                    // todo close all thread in executor 
                }
            }
            catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println();
            }

        }

**
I want to close all thread in executor after 15 minutes but I do not know how to close.
Someone said to use executor.shutDownNow() but it will close the executor (I can not submit thread anymore), I don't want that to happen
