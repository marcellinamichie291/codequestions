# How react-markdown should use MathJax (react-mathjax)

Could you help me please to create react component which can render markdown and which use MathJax.
I used this article Rendering Markdown and LaTeX in React to solve this problem, but ReactMarkdown now doesn't have such props as renderers. Also rehypeMathJax plugin doesn't work correctly. For example doesn't render correct such instance as
\begin{align}
\text{good: } &\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n i\right)^2. \\[1em]
\text{bad: }  &\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = (\sum_{i=1}^n i)^2.
\end{align}

If i use as below it works great, but how i should wrap it into ReactMarkdown component
<MathJax.Provider>
    <MathJax.Node inline formula={value || ''} />
    <MathJax.Node formula={value || ''} />
</MathJax.Provider>

Please please help!
