I am coding an menuedriven program in python using csv file . the program is basically to input the details which are the usrname and password and display the details .but in  the code while entering the details the  usernames should be unique which means the username should not  repeat.
import csv
def create_filelog():
     with open("login.csv","a",newline="") as f:
         csw=csv.writer(f)
         fields = ["USERNAME","PASSWORD"]

         while True:
             User=input("Enter the username\t:")
             Pass=int(input("Enter the password\t:"))
             row = [User,Pass]
             csw.writerow(fields)
             csw.writerow(row)
             ch=input("Do you want to continue adding records (Y/N)?")
             if ch in 'Nn':
                 break

this is the function in which we usually enter the details and what change should be made WHILE ENTERING THE CODE THE USERNAME SHOULD NOT BE REPEATED
import csv
def create_filelog():
     with open("login.csv","a",newline="") as f:
         csw=csv.writer(f)
         fields = ["USERNAME","PASSWORD"]

         while True:
             User=input("Enter the username\t:")
             Pass=int(input("Enter the password\t:"))
             row = [User,Pass]
             csw.writerow(fields)
             csw.writerow(row)
             ch=input("Do you want to continue adding records (Y/N)?")
             if ch in 'Nn':
                 break

here i tried but i dont know a method to make the username entered by the user should not be repeated
