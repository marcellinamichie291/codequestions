# What encoding is this character? And how to handle it in xml

<tac id="10" name="KD&#11;#36">

I have a program that saves in xml (using Java). But after saving this line, the xml cannot be loaded anymore (SAX Parser).
Do I need to change the xml header to something else than UTF-8, if yes, to what?
