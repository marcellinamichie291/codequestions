# Java Discord bot hosting free on Heroku

I am looking to deploy my first java Discord bot on Heroku. Is there a free possibility to host it that will work also after 28 November (Heroku plans changes date), and if not what would be the best option for a small bot?
I had a look on Heroku offers, and it seems no free option will be available after 28 Nov.
