I have a custom class and on initialisation, it gets an image based on the name inputed. I would like the possibility to also be able to input a uiImage instead of this computed property but that doesn't seem to work.
struct Item { 
    var name: String
    var image: UIImage {
        UIImage(named: name.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "-").lowercased())!
    }
}

Elsewhere, the first one works fine, but the second doesn't.
Item(name: "A")
Item(name: "B", image: someImg)

Thanks for any help
