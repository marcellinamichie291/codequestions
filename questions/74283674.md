# How to read manufacturer information from SD card?

I bought a few SD cards, from different sources.   They all are marked as SanSisk or Samsung with "speed class" of 10, and "UHS speed class" of 3.
I used Windows Powershell RoboCopy to copy several directories totaling ~40 GB to each card, and then compared the time taken to do so.  One of the cards took over 8 times as long (copying the same set of directories).
So, I'm wondering it the card was "relabeled" by the seller.
Is there any way, on Windows 10, that I could read any of the properties of the card ?   I've heard manufacturer info is saved somewhere on the card.
