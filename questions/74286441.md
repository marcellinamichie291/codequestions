# Licensing Form not disappearing when intended to

        {
            InitializeComponent();
            instance = this;

        }


        private void frmLicensing_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            using (IsolatedStorageFile isolatedStorageFile = IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore(IsolatedStorageScope.User | IsolatedStorageScope.Assembly, null, null))
            {
                

                    using (IsolatedStorageFileStream isolatedStorageFileStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("Setting.txt", System.IO.FileMode.Open, isolatedStorageFile))
                    {
                        using (System.IO.StreamReader sr = new System.IO.StreamReader(isolatedStorageFileStream))
                        {
                            var Activated = Activation.isactive(sr.ReadLine());
                            if (!Activated)
                            {
                                this.Show();
                            }
                            else if(Activated == true)
                            {
