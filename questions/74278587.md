# pipenv ignores previously created virtual environment

I have the following issue with creating new virtual environment using pipenv.
Short explanation:
When I run the command pipenv install django, two virtualenvs folders are created (one with virtual environment and django, ony with nothing). When I run pipenv shell, pipenv tries to open the second (empty) folder and creates new environment.
Long explanation:
In a new folder (without any data) called "myServer", I run the following command with the aim to create virtual enviroment and install django in the environment.
pipenv install django
This command creates two folders in C:\Users\Admin.virtualenvs:
myServer-XHrXcwBn
myServer-y6mANNT9
The myServer-XHrXcwBn folder contains all folders and files for the virtual environment.
The myServer-y6mANNT9 folder contains only the src folder, which is empty.
When I run
pipenv shell
pipenv tries to open the "y6mANNT9" environment (which is empty) and creates new environment in the y6mANNT9 folder.
I expect pipenv to create only one virtual environment when pipenv install django is used and open the same virtual environment when pipenv shell is used.
What am I doing wrong?
P.S.: I use PowerShell in Win 10.
