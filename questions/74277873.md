# why useRef current value , isn't sharing trough custom hook?

I wanted to calculate the user scroll height , so I created a custom hook. and I wanted to share this value to another component. but it doesnt work.
code:
const useScroll = () => {
  let scrollHeight = useRef(0);

  const scroll = () => {
    scrollHeight.current =
      window.pageYOffset ||
      (document.documentElement || document.body.parentNode || document.body)
        .scrollTop;
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("scroll", scroll);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("scroll", () => {});
    };
  }, []);

  return scrollHeight.current;
};

export default useScroll;


the value is not updating here.
but if I use useState  here , it works. but that causes tremendous amount of component re-rendering. can you have any idea , how its happening?
