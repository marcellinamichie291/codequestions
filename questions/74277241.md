# Error on webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

I am trying to put the import:
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager, and it gives me an error everywhere except in jupiter, I have tried everything and nothing
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import load_workbook

I have installed all possible versions of webdriver_manager, I have updated the python version and nothing, it only lets me run the program in jupiter
