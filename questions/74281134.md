# Having issues with basic responsive functionality

Want to float a YT video over an image, and have everything be responsive.

I do need the YT video to start at a particular size, and then be responsive with the image it is on top of

Here is what I currently have, I need to fix a couple of things:

Ensure the YT video starts at a certain size within the image (attached example)
Everything shrinks if screen gets smaller

Example Image

Current  Code:


.container {
       border: 1px solid #DDDDDD;
       position: relative;
    
    }
    .tag {
       float: left;
       position: absolute;
       left: 3%;
       top: 14%;
       z-index: 1000;
       background-color: #000000;
       padding: 5px;
       color: #FFFFFF;
       font-weight: bold;
       font-size:8vw
    }
<div class="container">
    <div class="tag"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaYqazlUMOA?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/732x295" alt="poulin" class="responsive">
</div>
