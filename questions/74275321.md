# How to recode this string variable into new variable in STATA?

I want to recode my Variable "Ucod" with >100000 different observations into 3-4 classified values in the form of new variable. The problem is I dont want to enter all the values of "Ucod" to recode, For e.g I want to use "If" condition like If any Value in "Ucod" that starts with I(Values for e.g, I234, I345, I587...) recode the whole value to "CVD" regardless of numeric in new variable? i.e, I457 (Ucod) >>> CVD (New variable)
I have tried using "strpos" command using different conditions but I was unsuccessful kindly help.
