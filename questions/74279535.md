# Train a Neural Network with .wav files

is there an efficient way to train a neural network with .wav files to make e.g. an audio generator or similar? .wav files are very heavy and contain several million frames when loaded into pytorch. Is there an efficient way to use large amount of data for training?
I tried to compress this data with run length encoding. However, the amount of data still remained very high.
