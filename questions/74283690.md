# Will the last request flow be cut off when the service is deployed?

Question:
When we deploy the service with k8s, using a blue-green deployment, will the last request made (to the old container) be cut off during container switching?
The old container may have been taken offline and the process inside killed before the request came back.
Can anyone help with this question? That's one thing I didn't think through
Tell me what you think. I think the flow of requests will be cut off
But I don't know if that's true
