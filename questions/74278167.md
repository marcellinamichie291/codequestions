# Convert CompressionOutputStream to ByteString in scala

There is a JAVA compression API call which gives me CompressionOutputStream and I want to return a ByteString. From what I have seen and tried to do is:

Using StreamConverters (https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/operators/StreamConverters/fromOutputStream.html)
val sink:


Sink[ByteString, Future[IOResult]] =
StreamConverters.fromOutputStream(() => outputStream)  <- This returns
a Sink but I do not how to convert it to ByteString


Using BufferedOutputStream (There is no #getBytes in CompressionInputStream so I wanted to convert it to BufferedOutputStream but its not correct)


val bufferedOutputStream = new BufferedOutputStream()
bufferedOutputStream.writeTo(myOutputStream)
bufferedOutputStream.getBytes()


Any suggestions/help is appreciated.Thanks
