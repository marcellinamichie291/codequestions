# How to fix incorrect line breaks in obsidian?

I have a certain text, let's say that I have it divided into 3 lines by line breaks. As you can see in the screenshot below, if I copy it from my VS Code editor to Obsidian, it inserts an extra line break after each line

However, if I paste the same text from the telegram, then it will be displayed correctly in obsidian

I donâ€™t understand what caused markdown behavior in obsidian and is it possible to somehow fix it so that this is the one-valued behavior for all cases
