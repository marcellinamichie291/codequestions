# Do Azure Data Factory updates the functions and formulae in Excel file while fetching?

I have been working on a dynamic Excel file using Azure Data Factory to move data from Excel file to Azure SQL.
The context is:
My test Excel file is having only one cell filled with data with NOW() function.
In excel, every time I refresh the file the NOW() function I get the latest date and time.
But when, I preview the data in ADF, I get the old date and time every time (Not latest)
Now the question is:
Can I refresh the Excel file using ADF OR ADF can only make use of static Excel file. If there is a way to use dynamic Excel file in ADF, kindly let me know.
Thanks!
