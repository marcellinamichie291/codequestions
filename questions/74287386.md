# VBA to resize comments on selected range instead of whole sheet

I am using the following code to auto resize comments (notes)  in my excel spread sheet. However my sheet is very large and the code works but is slow.  To speed it up I wish to specify a smaller range that it works on as I do not need it to work on the whole sheet. Lets say cells A1 to B10.  Does Any one know how I can do this? See my code below
Thanks in Advance rockingmark
Sub NotesResize()


Dim MyComments As Comment
Dim lArea As Long


For Each MyComments In ActiveSheet.Comments
  With MyComments
    .Shape.TextFrame.AutoSize = True
    If .Shape.Width > 300 Then
      lArea = .Shape.Width * .Shape.Height
      .Shape.Width = 200
      ' An adjustment factor of 1.1 seems to work ok.
      .Shape.Height = (lArea / 200) * 1.1
    End If
  End With
Next ' comment
End Sub

I have tried setting ranges as follows, but I get Run time error '438': Object doesn't support this property or method. Hopefully someone knows a better way that works?
Sub NotesResizeSelection()

Dim MyComments As Comment
Dim lArea As Long
Dim rng2 As Range
Set rng2 = Range("A1:B10")

For Each MyComments In rng2.Comments
  With MyComments
    .Shape.TextFrame.AutoSize = True
    If .Shape.Width > 300 Then
      lArea = .Shape.Width * .Shape.Height
      .Shape.Width = 200
      ' An adjustment factor of 1.1 seems to work ok.
      .Shape.Height = (lArea / 200) * 1.1
    End If
  End With
Next ' comment
End Sub
