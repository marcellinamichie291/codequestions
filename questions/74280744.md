# Sort an array of arrays with JavaScript

I'm trying to sort an array of arrays with integers inside, for example:
var array = [['1 ', 'C140106'], ['2 ', 'C091815'], ['3 ', 'C140106'], ['4 ', 'C060001']];

How can I sort it in order to return something like the following?
array = [[4,'C060001'], [2,'C091815' ], [1,'C140106' ], [3,'C140106']];

  let ans = renglones.sort( (a, b) => {
      return a[1] - b[1]
    })

this does not work
