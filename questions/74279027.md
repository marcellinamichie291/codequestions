# passing data in components in react native

I am new in react native and facing a issue in passing data to the component.
having a component named WebSocket ,In this have multiple parameters to be accepted like below
  const WebSocket = ({
   socketUrl,
   socketFirstRequest,
   socketSecondRequest,
}) => {
// connecting socket and sending data to socket.
}

Now How to use this components at multiple places to send data to this component
I tried this but not working like this.
const InstrumentList = () => {
  // my request params for GC1_URL,socketFirstRequest,socketSecondRequest
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {checkStatus === false && (
        <WebSocketGC1
          socketUrl={GC1_URL}
          socketFirstRequest={socketFirstRequest}
          socketSecondRequest={socketSecondRequest}
        />
      )}
 </View>
  );
}
