# How to Use z.discriminatedUnion() in TRPC?

Just getting used to trpc. Say I have a standard procedure:
update: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      type: z.string(),
      content: z.object({ title: z.string() }).nullish()
    }).nullish())

Now what I am interested in is the content attribute. In my mysql schema, that content field is a JSON field. Depending on the type field, it will contain different values.
For example. If type is blogPost, it will contain attributes like title & category, but if the type is set to landingPage those attributes will change. (just an example to make it more straightforward, my use case isn't about blogPosts etc.)
As far as I understand, I can solve this with discriminatedUnion:
z.discriminatedUnion("type", [
    z.object({ type: z.literal("a"), a: z.string() }),
    z.object({ type: z.literal("b"), b: z.string() }),
  ])
  .parse({ type: "a", a: "abc" });

but i am not sure how to apply this to my case? I want it to only apply to the content field and keep the other attributes the same.
