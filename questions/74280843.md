# How to filter data from mongodb that the difference between (date + years (these both from database)) and today's date is lesser or equal to a month

there is a schema
const schemaDB = mongoose.Schema({
  product:{
    type: String,
  },
  DateOfInstallation: {
    type: Date
  },
  standardWarranty: {
    type: Number
  },
  extendedWarranty: {
    type: Number
  },
  AMC:{
    type: Number
  }
})

i need to get the list of all products that are going to expire within 1 month from today.
total_years_to_Add = standardWarranty  + extendedWarranty + AMC
date_exp = DateOfInstallation + addYears(total_years_to_Add) 
date_diff = date_exp - today's Date

return data if date_diff less than month
plz help in debug the given mongodb aggregate query (implemented in mongoose)


const datas = await DBModel.aggregate([
{
$match: {
total: { $add: ['$standardWarranty','$extendedWarranty','$AMC']},
newdate: { $dateAdd: {
startDate: '$DateOfInstallation',
unit: "year",
amount: "$$total"
}},
$lte: [{$dateDiff:{
startDate: "$$newdate",
endDate: new Date(),
unit: "month"
}},1]
}},
{ $project:{
"DateOfInstallation":1, "standardWarranty":1, "extendedWarranty":1,"AMC":1
}},
{$sort:{
"DateOfInstallation": 1
}}
])



i know that $add cannot be used inside $match,
can anyone help to query the same
