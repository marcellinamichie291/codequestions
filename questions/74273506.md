# Cpanel WebServer Config

We have worked on a project which its back-end is developed with Laravel and accessible on the subdomain, and project's front-end is developed with Next and is accessible on the main domain. To bring the project online, we installed CPanel on our server. The problem is that the NodeJS application gets loaded in the subdomain address instead of the Laravel root. How should the web server settings be to work properly?
