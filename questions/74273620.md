# SSL handshake issue for one server

i have an SSL handshake issue on one of my servers. the certificate is CA signed and the server is still showing "not secure"
i got another server using the same root chain and it is secured.
root/intermediate certs and the CA itself are all uploaded on the machine and the browser
chain is 100% valid as it was identified via the Subject Key Identifier/Authority Key Identfier.
from pcap i see this for non-working
CSR was verified to match the cert

the server side is never pushing the Hell Server,Certificate message
it does look like a server side issue for me. not a client one
again the same chain is used for another server and the browser is considering it secure.
anyone can assist?
certs were uploaded on Trust-root authority for the browser
installed on the machine itself (local machine and current user)
cert itself was verified
certificate was verified in the server's DB as well as its chain
