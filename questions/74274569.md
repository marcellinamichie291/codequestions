# Ensure that password reset is mandatory for all users on first login Sonarqube

SonarQube Version - 8.9.0
We want the newly created users to be asked for password reset on first login.
Docs https://docs.sonarqube.org/8.9/,
However didn't find any relevant setting which can help us implement the same.
All newly created users are able to change their passwords upon login but the setting is not mandatory for them.
