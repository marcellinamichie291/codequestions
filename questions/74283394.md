# Unable to use list of datetime indexes, for the index of a split df's index

I use a function in vectorbt lib which splits data into ranges like a rolling split, and returns a df which is the data with splits and a range index, and a list of datetime index values where every element is a list of all the index values corresponding to a split. I need to set the index of the new data df to the list of datetime index values. I tried doing so numerous times by making a new df and setting the df's index as well, but was unable to properly do so. The code to split the data is shown below, and images of the shapes and data is attached. The code of the split is similar to sklearn.model_selection.BaseCrossValidator which are both used for splitting data for walkforward optimization.
