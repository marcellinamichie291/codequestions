# Flutter "reader apps" for ios

I am publishing a reader app with external purchasing method. Unfortunately apple rejected my app with this issues.
I already enabled entitlement from my account.
I already made their modal for external linking.
I have no idea how to use there External Link Account API.
Thanks.
Your "reader" app uses the External Link Account entitlement to link out for account creation and management but does not meet all requirements for using this entitlement.
Specifically, we found that your app does not meet the following requirement(s):

- Your app does not use the External Link Account API to populate the modal sheet before every instance of linking out for account creation and management.
- The link out opens in a web view, rather than in the default web browser for the user's device.
- The URL for linking out is not formatted as a standard HTML link and/or does not contain the domain name of your website.
