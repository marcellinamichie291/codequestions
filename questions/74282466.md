# How to determine if a DraggableScrollableController is animating in Flutter?

I have a DraggableScrollableSheet that has a DraggableScrollableController. I'm calling .animateTo() on the DraggableScrollableController. Is there any way to tell outside of the sheet, in another widget maybe, that the sheet is animating? Some kind of isAnimating type property where the default is false, then when you call animateTo and you check this property it is true and when it completes, back to false?
