# Eclipse rcp help content not working after application migration from indigo to eclipse 4.16

I am working on and eclipse rcp project which is written in indigo. I had migrated it from indigo to eclipse 4.16 using compatibility layer.
The migration was successfull but I am facing issue in launching the help content of the application.
On launch through eclipse, the help screen doesnâ€™t show up and there is no error message.
When we launch through installer, We receive the following error

As I checked in run configurations, some plugins(org.eclipse.equinox.http) are unable to resolve javax.servlet which is present in target platform and is selected.
Could this isssue be around javax.servlet? How could I resolve it as that jar is already present. Or could it be some other problem that I am missing.
Please help.
I tried including indigo version dependencies but after doing that, there is a problem with launch of whole application
