# Returning a negative int literal in comparator lambda-expression sorts list in reverse order

When I use sort() or sorted() on a List or stream respectively, and I pass a lambda expression with an int literal like so:

sorted((s1,s2) -> -500)

I expect the result to have the same order as it had before. But instead the order is reversed. When I return a positive integer, the order stays the same. Why is this? My initial expectation is that it should be the other way around.
