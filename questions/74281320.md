# How can I authenticate a local client to a Windows service in Go

I have an application that needs to be able to perform certain actions with elevated privileges on behalf of users who do not have administrator rights. In the Linux world I would be looking for setuid, but to my knowledge no equivalent exists in Windows. It seems like the next best thing is to split my program in two: a CLI binary to be run by the user and a Windows Service to actually do the stuff. The two could communicate on localhost, using named pipes, or via some other IPC method I'm unfamiliar with. Whatever I choose, it needs to be able to authenticate domain users as well as local users on non-domain joined PCs so that I can enforce rules like

Alice is only allowed to run A, B, & C
Bob is only allowed to run C, & D

I control both the client and the service, so I have some flexibility for how to do this. So far my best option looks like named pipes, since they offer ImpersonateNamedPipeClient. I figured I could call ImpersonateNamedPipeClient then call user.Current() to figure out who connected. I started to build this using Microsoft's go-winio, but it required changes to the library to even support ImpersonateNamedPipeClient and now I'm trying to learn Window's security descriptor language and how to set a requested impersonation level. It seems like a lot.
I'm hoping there is a simpler way for a golang Windows service to do authenticated IPC.
