# Refresh Chrome Extension without reloading the page

I am making a chrome extension, fetching Data from DB for particular language, but whenever I change language I have to refresh the chrome page to fetch the updated Data from DB.
Is there a way to fetch new Data as the language changes without refreshing the chrome page.
I tried using Mutation observer but failed. Kindly guide any way possible
