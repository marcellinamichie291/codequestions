I have a local proxmox cluster which was initially configured IPv4 only with static IPv4 addresses.
Now I want to add IPv6 support too and no matter which configuration I choose the server did not get any ipv6 address but its fe80:: one.
I tried with auto and DHCP but both not with success.
Here is my current config from /etc/network/interfaces:
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eno1 inet manual

iface eno1 inet6 manual

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
        address 192.168.15.16/24
        gateway 192.168.15.1
        bridge-ports eno1
        bridge-stp off
        bridge-fd 0

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet6 dhcp
        bridge-ports eno1
        bridge-stp off
        bridge-fd 0


Is it maybe not possible to mix static and dynamic Ip address assignment or does anyone has an idea how to fix that?
