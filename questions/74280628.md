# Website on iOS (Chrome and Safari) too wide

I am developing a site which is to also run on mobile devices. I have an issue with both Chrome and Safari on my iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 16.2.
The problem is that when I launch my dialog to log in, the content appears to "grow" horizontally, causing what appears to be a "zoom". I have checked every CSS element in my app, and I cannot see anywhere I'm specifying a min-width or anything of that sort that might cause this. Can someone help me pinpoint the issue? Or point me to a resource that can help alleviate this problem?
My site is live here: https://chonk.jambudipa.io
Here is how it looks when you launch the dialog by clicking on "Sign in":

And here is how it looks after pinching to resize the window to fix the size issue, how it should look:

What is going on?? I have tried all sort of meta properties and strange CSS hacks found online, but none of them work.
