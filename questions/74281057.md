# Analytics with Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy?

I have one page on my site that uses SharedArrayBuffer, which means I need to use Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy - but this also means I can't use analytics to see if anyone actually uses that page or not.
So I wondered if there's a workaround for this?
I use Fathom Analytics for tracking, so have it analytics set to load from a sub-domain on my site.
I have set the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy to require-corp, and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy to same-origin.
Is there a way to either iframe the analytics, or iframe the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy app and have analytics on the parent? I've tried looking this stuff up but it's very much outside my realm of expertise. Thanks for any guidance you can offer.
