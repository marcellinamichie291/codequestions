Every time I start my expo project with yarn start I get the following error once my android device tries to upload and launch the app.

AsyncStorage has been extracted from react-native core and will be removed in a future release. It can now be installed and imported from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' instead of 'react-native'. See https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage

I tried both upgrading/downgrading my version of expo-cli, but to no avail. This issue is occurring since we migrated to eas build system for expo.
What's the solution to avoid android throwing an exception entity too large when transferring the build to the device?
