From this morning, I work with Speedtest-cli Python to learn Python. But, I have a problem... I schearch for 2 hours to solve this error: "speedtest.SpeedtestBestServerFailure: Unable to connect to servers to test latency.". I really don't have any idea of why I have this and I dont find solve to fix this issue.
If somebody has an idea how I can solve that.
The Python file and screenshot of my error in my Python Terminal:
`
import speedtest

s = speedtest.Speedtest(secure=True)
bytes = 1000000
dws = round(s.download()/bytes,2)
ups = round(s.upload()/bytes,2)
print("Download speed is :",dws)
print("Upload speed is :",ups)

`

I try first uninstall and reinstall Speedtest-cli and i schearch for 3 hours on internet.
