# ERROR: could not open file when IMPORTING using COPY FROM query

HINT:  COPY FROM instructs the PostgreSQL server process to read a file. You may want a client-side facility such as psql's \copy.
SQL state: 58P01
I'm trying to import a CSV file on my Mac version of this software and it is not working and returning that error
COPY us_counties_2010
  FROM 'C:/Users/*****/Downloads/us_counties_2010.csv'
  WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);

I was expecting for this file to import
