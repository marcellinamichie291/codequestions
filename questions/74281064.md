# Free API for retrieving places based on query string

we need in our application (React used in frontend) API for retrieving places based on user typed query. For example user wants event to take place in "Korzo pub", which is located somewhere in Bratislava, Slovakia. Is there any free API that can search places based on its names query? I have found Google places API but we can't afford to pay for that. Also I have found OpenStreetMap (we want to include map in v2 of our app) and Overpass API but I don't know if this service provides result as name of some specific place or just seeks for example street names.
