# Defining function in Python with values contained in a .csv file

I am struggling upon a certain problem in Python. I want to define a certain function a_parameter(group_1, group_2). I store the function values in a .csv file in the following manner:
group_1, group_2, a_parameter
1,2,86.02
2,1,-35.36
1,3,61.13
3,1,-11.12
...
So I want to define a function that will output a(1,2) = 86.02; a(2,1) = -35.36 and so on. I would also want my function to be equal to zero if a certain combination of group_1, group_2 is absent in the .csv file (nonzero values only for the combinations stored in the file).
I have tried a brute force method to store all the values in the separate variables:
a_parameter_1_2 = 86.02
a_parameter_2_1 = -35.02
...
but the list would be huge and I need a more compact and automated way to do it.
