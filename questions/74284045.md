# Create DML, DDL, DQL user in PostgreSQL

I need to create 3 users with different DML, DDL, DQL on newly created clean Database in PostgreSQL.

DML should have SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
DDL should have CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, INSERT
DQL should have SELECT

all of this in standard scheme public.
Important is that user inherit right on newly created tables by DDL user.
users ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/
I did some coding but I'm pretty new in PostgreSQL and it didn't work :(
The main problem was that I cannot perform GRANT or REVOKE on CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE :(
Can someone help please?
Maybe you have something similar already prepared?
