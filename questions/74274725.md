# employee table have multiple employee name for same employee id. need to identify correct name from name table

Employee table have multiple employee name for same employee id. Need to identify correct name from name table and display matched row alone. In case name table don't have employee id present in employee table then display multiple employee name.
Emp table
id name   status
1  David   0
1  James   1
2  Kelvin  0
2  John    1

Name table
id    Name
1     James

Expected output
Id Name status
1 James  1
2 Kelvin 0
2 John   1

If I do inner join then I will get only match record. When emp id available in both employee and name then display only matched record, when empid present in employee table not available in name table then display all rows.
