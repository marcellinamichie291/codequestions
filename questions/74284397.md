# How to access http headers for Spring Data auditing in WebFlux

I'm trying to make use of http headers to audit my Spring Repository, as mentioned here https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#auditing.reactive-auditor-aware
But the challenge I face is that I don't use Spring Security, my userId comes in as plain text in http header.
I got as far as working out that in WebFlux case I need to use Reactor Context, and if I understand it correctly there already is a filter that does it: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/reactive/ServerWebExchangeContextFilter.html, but I struggle to write the code to extract it.
Does any one know of any articles/blogs/snippets that could point me in the right direction?
