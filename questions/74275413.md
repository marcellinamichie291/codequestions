# How to create a nested subquery to be inserted into multiple tables in c# linq

i have 3 tables in which i would want the tables to look as follows
Table1

Table 2 will be the sub categories of table 1

And Table 3 will store items belonging to table1 and table 2. Not all items in this table will have a subcategory.
Table 3

just for easier reading this is the structure

so this is what i tried:
i created a class as follows
public class values{
public string code {get;set;}
public List<string> Table1Category { get; set; } = CreateCategory()
private static IEnumerable<string> CreateCatergory()
        {
            return new List<string>
            {
                 "Bedroom",
                 "Balcony",
                 "Kitchen"

            };
        }
}

and then i call a method as follows
public async Task ExecuteAsync(values command)
        {
            foreach (var catergory in command.Table1Category )
            {
                var catergoryGuid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
                Model category = (new Model
                {
                    Name = catergory,
                    Id = catergoryGuid,
                    code= command.code
                });
                await Table1.AddAsync(category);
 
            }
        }

this adds my data into table 1 the part i am stuck with is i dont know how to link the items from all tables with each another
