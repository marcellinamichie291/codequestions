There are several operators to trim strings from Shell Variable:




Operator
Description
VAR="AAAworldIII"




${VAR#pattern
Remove shortest front-anchored pattern
$ echo ${VAR#A}$ AAworldIII


${VAR%pattern}
Remove shortest rear-anchored pattern
$ echo ${VAR%I}$ AAAworldII




So to remove symbols [ and ] from string [BASH] I need to do 2 assignments in the script:
$ VAR="[BASH]" # 

$ VAR=${VAR#[} # 1) remove leading [
$ VAR=${VAR%]} # 2) remove trailing ]

$ ... # here I can use the VAR

Is there a way to perform steps 1) and 2) at once to avoid doing these 2 assignments to the same variable ? Like:
$ VAR="[BASH]"
$ VAR=some_uknown_operator_to_trim_strings_from_VAR. 
$ ... then my script code uses VAR


PS: I am looking for a way/operator to remove only leading and trailing characters (strings) AT ONCE. I know a way how to trim leading and trailing string using 2 assignment. Trimming symbols can present in the middle of the string contained by VAR (Like VAR="[BA[S]H]"), they should stay there they are
