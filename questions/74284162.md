# Failed building wheel for psycopg2 (Windows 11)

I am building a Django project, and as I was installing the psycopg2(using virtual env), I kept getting an error.
Versions:

Django==4.1.2
Python==3.11.0
PIP==22.3
OS==Win11

Code:
(env) PS C:\Users\keiko\Desktop\project> pip install psycopg2
Error:

ERROR: Failed building wheel for psycopg2 
Running setup.py clean for psycopg2 
Failed to build psycopg2 
Installing collected packages: psycopg2 
Running setup.py install for psycopg2 ... error


note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
error: legacy-install-failure

I have already tried the solutions I found on the internet like:

Install psycopg2-binary instead.
Code: pip install psycopg2-binary


Error: Failed building wheel for psycopg2-binary


Upgrade the wheel and setup tools
Code:

pip install --upgrade wheel
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install psycopg2


Install it with python
Code: python -m pip install psycopg2 


ERROR: Failed building wheel for psycopg2


Install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools

... but still none of these solutions helped me. I'm really hoping to install the package(psycopg2) on my project, I've been stuck with this error for so long and I can't really find any solution to this. I hope someone can help me with this.
