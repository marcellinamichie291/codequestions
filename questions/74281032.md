# How can I use rollaply after group by in a whole data frame in R?

I have a data frame that looks like this:
library(tidyverse)
library(zoo)
date = c(rep(as.Date("2022/1/1"),5),rep(as.Date("2022/1/12"),5)) 
a = seq(1,10,1)
b = seq(-1,-10,-1)
c = seq(10,-20,length.out=10)
window=c(rep(2,5),rep(3,5))
A = tibble(date,a,b,c,window);A

   date           a     b       c window
   <date>     <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>
 1 2022-01-01     1    -1  10          2
 2 2022-01-01     2    -2   6.667      2
 3 2022-01-01     3    -3   3.333      2
 4 2022-01-01     4    -4   0          2
 5 2022-01-01     5    -5  -3.333      2
 6 2022-01-12     6    -6  -6.667      3
 7 2022-01-12     7    -7 -10          3
 8 2022-01-12     8    -8 -13.33       3
 9 2022-01-12     9    -9 -16.67       3
10 2022-01-12    10   -10 -20          3

I want to group by date the columns a,b,c and apply a rolling window of width equal the window value for this date in the all the columns a,b,c and calculate the minimum of them.
For example, for the date 2022-01-01 with window 2 it will search for the minimum in the first row (which will be -1) then will move downwards by 1 so will search the minimum in the first and second row that will be again -2,then into second and third that will be -3, to third and fourth that will be -4,then the fourth and fifth row that will be -5, and last the fifth row that will be -5 again.
The same procedure for the date 2022-01-12 with width 3 and will be, -10,-13,33,-16,67,-20 and -20.
Ideally I want the resulted data frame to be the minimum of all minimums grouped by - summarized by date:




date
MINS




2022-01-01
-5


2022-01-12
-20




I think that rollapply function for whole matrices can be done with by.column = FALSE
So I tried :
A%>%group_by(date)%>%
  summarise(Vectors = rollapply(A[,2:4],width = window,min,by=1,by.column=FALSE))

but it doesn't work.
Any help ?
