As far as I know, when you use git with https, you would have to type in your password every time you make a request to github unless you use SSH or you store your credentials locally on your computer with git config credential.helper store .
I've been using HTTPS but never have to type in my credentials. When I run git config --list it only shows my email and my name, but not my password. Can anyone explain to me why I am not required to type in my password or where it could be stored?
