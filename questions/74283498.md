# AWS RDS: How to use AD Account to Authenticate

I have an AWS RDS Instance and AWS Directory Service. RDS appears to be joined to the domain, I can find the computer name in the AD.
I can log on using SQL Authentication.
I cannot log on using AD Authentication.
Using SQL Server (via SQL Authentication), when I try to add a Domain User:
USE [master]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [myad\myuser] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master]
GO

I get:
Msg 15401, Level 16, State 1, Line 3
Windows NT user or group 'myad\myuser' not found. Check the name again.

I also tried using the myad\admin account, but that did not work.
What am I missing ?
