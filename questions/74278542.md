# Symfony phpunit - Accessing the "validator" service directly from the container is deprecated, use dependency injection instead

A deprecation notice is complaining about this line in setUp() in a phpunit test file:
$this->validator = static::$kernel->getContainer()->get('validator');

It says:
Accessing the "validator" service directly from the container is deprecated, use dependency injection instead.

What is the correct way to update this to use dependency injection instead?
