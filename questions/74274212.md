# how to change current directory (cd command in VScode) GITLAB

I have cloned a repository to my vscode, and before starting to work on the assignment I was given, I have created a branch using git branch 
(branch-name)`


now, I finished the first assignment (milestone1 is the name of the first assignment branch I assigned), and now I want to add it, and then commit and start a new branch and work on the second assignment I was given, but I have an error.
the error is:
`fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`


what should I do next?
Thanks!
what I have tried:
I have tried to change the current directory without the right command.
I have tried to search for the right command on google with no success.
I have tried to use
`git help -g 

for more commands and maybe solve this on my own.
and I need to follow the assignment deadlines so I have no more time to spend on it.
can someone help me solve this issue or point me in the right direction?
What I was expecting?
when I type
`cd -` 

and click the
`TAB` 

key, to be able to see the directory I need to go to when I am trying to type part of the dir name.. but I had no such option.
