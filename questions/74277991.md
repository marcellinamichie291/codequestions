# Could not find artifact javax.xml:xmldsig

I am trying to run a jenkins build pipeline to build my project.
I get a pretty bad error from the jenkins console which seems to be misleading and also doesnt match with the output on the slave server. (the jenkins console output is at the end)
So i logged onto the jenkins slave where the branch of code is checked-out and ran the exact same command that is used to build the code and get a different more clear error.
Another key point of info - i run the exact same command on the exact same branch that is checked out on my development server and the build is successful - which confuses me even more?

Stuff ive tried already:

mvn clean install -U
MVN Dependency tree - see if this jar is being installed from another and to exclude - its not
I have also tried to directly add the missing dependency but i get the same error still

Anyone had an issue like this before? im super confused
