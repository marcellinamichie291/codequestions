# Python parsing ini file with global scope/properties

Sample ini file that I want to parse and change.
global_key = global_value
.include other_file.ini

[section]
key = value

Is there a way to parse and augment this with Python? I know usually ConfigParser is recommended for ini files, I didn't find any way to parse a file with global scope.
