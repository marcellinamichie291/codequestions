# userlocation not show in apple maps from react-native-maps library

device: iphone 12pro and iphone 8, all devices with ios 16.x.x
react-native: 0.70.0
react: 18.1.0
react-native-maps: 1.3.2
When launching the application with apple maps, the question that allows to accept the user location permissions is not displayed, with google maps it is displayed.
What do I need to be able to display the question in ios?
These permissions are in my infoplist file:
<string>TEXT</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>

<string>TEXT</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
