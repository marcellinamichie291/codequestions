I was just finishing my project for a web page and when i try to run it, Tomcat dont start and shows many lines, one of them seems to be a rasonable error. Its says like this:
2022-11-02 03:14:02.889 ERROR 2976 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatStarter  : Error starting Tomcat context. Exception: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException. Message: Error creating bean with name 'jwtTokenFilter' defined in class path resource [com/portfolio/gregorioalasino/Security/MainSecurity.class]: Post-processing of merged bean definition failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to introspect Class [com.portfolio.gregorioalasino.Security.jwt.JwtTokenFilter] from ClassLoader [org.springframework.boot.devtools.restart.classloader.RestartClassLoader@2885fb16]
I cant find the error. Its a project for a web portfolio of a program called Argentina Programa in order to become a FullS Jr !

I tried looking for some syntaxis errors and nothing
