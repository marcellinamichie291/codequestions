I have an Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 board, a battery and an on/off switch. I'd like to connect them in such a way that all of the following are satisfied:

Switch turns the board on/off
Board is powered by battery or USB
USB connection to board charges the battery, regardless of the switch state

I could just put the switch in between battery and board, but then I'd need to close the switch to charge.
