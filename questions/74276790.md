With Volkszaehler (a DIY smart meter) I am logging different signals like current and power sensors of my photovoltaic system.
I also want to log the fill level of my solar battery. But the only data type which is matching is "filling level"/"FÃ¼llstand". Unfortunately this data type is linked with the unit "l" (litre). But in my case I need a filling level unit "%" (percent/Prozent).
How can I change the unit of the data type "fill level" or add another data type with the unit "%"?
