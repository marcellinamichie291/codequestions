I have the following problem on performing a left join between 2 tables.
Table SC1




COMPANY
PEDIDO
ITEM_NUMBER
VALUE




1
4789
1
100


1
4789
2
120




and Table SD1




COMPANY
PEDIDO
ITEM_NUMBER
DOC_NUMBER




1
7489
1
5874


1
7489
1
5875


1
7489
2
5880




I need to bring the Doc_Number to the SC1 table. But when I use left join and there are more than 1 Doc_Number fot the key, it duplicates the result.
Here's the result I'm getting:




COMPANY
PEDIDO
ITEM_NUMBER
VALUE
DOC_NUMBER




1
7489
1
100
5874


1
7489
1
100
5875


1
7489
2
120
5880




The result I want:




COMPANY
PEDIDO
ITEM_NUMBER
VALUE
DOC NUMBER




1
7489
1
100
5874-5875


1
7489
2
120
5880




Here's the code I'm using:
SELECT COMPANY,
       PEDIDO,
       ITEM_NUMBER,
       VALUE,
       DOC_NUMBER`
FROM SC1
     LEFT JOIN SD1 ON SC1.COMPANY = SD1.COMPANY
                  AND SC1.PEDIDO = SD1.PEDIDO
                  AND SC1.ITEM_NUMBER = SD1.ITEM_NUMBER;
GO
