# How to resolve private dns names in private vpc from another vpc(not public)?

I have 2 vpc's(private and vpn) in aws account in one region.
Vpn vpc used for connection to private instances, and i can connect through private ip addresses.
But i can not resolve private dns hostnames and can not connect via dns names.
What should i setup to establish connection by dns names?
I've setup route53 resolver and added A records to private ip addresses which are associated with dns names.
But still can not resolve this dns names.
