# Changing format to hh:mm:ss still leaves date in formula bar, and doesn't allow for accurate time sorting

After changing a column to hh:mm:ss format, the date is removed from all of the values but when trying to sort the column from smallest to largest, it continues to acknowledge the dates that can only be seen in the formula bar, and therefore sorts the values using also their dates from smallest to largest. How can I get rid of the date completely so I can sort the column solely based on times?
