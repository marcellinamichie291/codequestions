# 'form' element makes change request method abruptly

i'm having a trouble with 'form' tag in client side.
While i use form tag with axios post request, which makes 'post' request to 'get', and i'm wondering why this happens.
Currently, i changed the 'form' tag to 'div' and now it works very well with out chaning requesting method abruptly.
Anyone could let me know deeply about the 'form' tag ?
Thanks!
