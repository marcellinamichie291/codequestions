# Git hook post-push not executing .bat file

i want to make a continuos delivery for my EC2 instance in every git push.
For this i write the "update_server.bat" that works perfectly:
scp -i "my-pem-file.pem" update.sh ec2-user@ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user/.
ssh -i "my-pem-file.pem" ec2-user@ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com "sudo bash ./update.sh"

as you see, it executes "update.sh" in the EC2 instance after uploading it.
cd portfolio/
git pull
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo kill $(pgrep -f 'main.py')
nohup sudo python3 main.py &>/dev/null &
exit

now i just want the ".git/hooks/post-push" to execute my "update_server.bat" but isn't working.
#!/bin/sh
aws_access/update_server.bat

#!/bin/sh
REPO_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
UPDATE_SCRIPT_PATH="$REPO_DIR/aws_access/update_server.cmd"
cmd.exe /c "$UPDATE_SCRIPT_PATH"

i tried renaming .bat to .cmd and removed "@echo off" from my script, and many other adjusts, but with no success. I really need help with this, what is the problem here? I'm sure the "update_server.bat" script works
