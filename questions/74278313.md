# highlight a cell that contains a string in an array

I tried to highlight a cell that contains any of the string in a certain column. It work but i also want to delete the entire row of cell that is not highlighted.
Dim Cells, cella As Range
Dim i As Integer
Dim uB, lB As Integer



Set ws = ActiveSheet
Set Cells = ws.Range("J2:J100")
myArray = Array("ALM", "NYF", "NED", "NND", "NYW", "PAF", "PAD", "FLM", "ALD", "AZR", 
"CAR", "FLK", "NIO")

uB = UBound(myArray)
lB = LBound(myArray)

For Each cell In Cells
 For i = lB To uB
    If InStr(1, cell.Value, myArray(i)) > 0 Then
                cell.Interior.ColorIndex = 35
    Else
                cell.EntireRow.Delete
    End If
   Next i
Next cell
