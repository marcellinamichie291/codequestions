# Can't find build docker image in azure pipeline

These are my logs and dockerfile. my docker image was build but I am not sure why it isn't found? How do I see the files created? Is there any way to write in docker or yaml to output structure and names of file created. In build it says successfuly build and addded to azure container registry. Not sure how to debug this or what to do from this point.
