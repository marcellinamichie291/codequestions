# How can I create a copy of a virtualenv in pyenv?

I used pyenv to create a virtualenv and activate it,
pyenv virtualenv myenv
pyenv activate myenv

then proceeded to perform a complicated and time-consuming installation of various Python packages in that virtual environment. Now I'd like to clone or duplicate or copy this virtualenv somehow, so that I can deactivate myenv and leave it untouched while I experiment with variations. Basically, I'm looking for something like
pyenv virtualenv-copy myenv myenv-copy

which I would use in a sequence such as, for example,
pyenv deactivate
pyenv virtualenv-copy myenv myenv-copy
pyenv activate myenv-copy

but nothing like pyenv virtualenv-copy seems to exist. What is the recommended approach for achieving this?
