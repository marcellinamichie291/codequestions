# Generating random configuration model graphs with adjacency matrix in python no other libraries

I'm generating undirected graph using adjacency matrix since igraph is so slow so no other libraries
`graph = [[0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]`

this is a graph adjacency matrix, I want to generate random configuration graph Configuration model algorithm
`degree_seq = [sum(row) for row in graph]
chain_ = chain.from_iterable
all_sum = np.sum(degree_seq)

```
if all_sum % 2 == 0:
    stublist = list(chain_([n] * d for n, d in enumerate(degree_seq)))
    n = len(stublist)

    half = n // 2
    while half > 0:
        random.shuffle(stublist)

        out_stublist, in_stublist = stublist[:half], stublist[half:]
        half = half // 2
        list_zip = zip(out_stublist, in_stublist)
        zipped_stubs = set(list_zip)`
```

first part of my question I'd like to enforce the random configuration graph to be simple, I'm doing this in a class so I'm just calling an instance with only node_num and null edges
I want to have a random configuration graph (adjacency matrix) to be simple with no loops or multi-edges
secondly how to plot a class of adjacency matrix?
I tried another algorithm Erdős–Rényi model
but I'm also facing the problem with enforcing a simple graph and how to integrate it with the algorithm!!
```

nodes_ = list(range(0, nodes))
edges = combinations(range(nodes_), 2)
graph = graph(nodes_,)

graph.add_nodes(range(nodes))
if p <= 0:
    return graph
if p >= 1:
   #return nx.complete_graph(nodes, create_using=G)

for e in edges:
    if seed.random() < p:
        G.add_edge(*e)



```
