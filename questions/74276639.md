# How to draw a line which cross two points but spans across the X direction using Plotly Python?

I plotted a candlestick chart (X axis being timeseries, Y axis being stock prices) with a segment (the blue one) which started from a datapoint and ended with another datapoint

import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/finance-charts-apple.csv')
print(len(df['Date']))
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=df['Date'],
                open=df['AAPL.Open'],
                high=df['AAPL.High'],
                low=df['AAPL.Low'],
                close=df['AAPL.Close'])])

fig.add_shape(type='line',
              x0=df['Date'][200], y0=df['AAPL.Open'][200],
              x1=df['Date'][400], y1=df['AAPL.Open'][400],
              line=dict(color='blue', width=3),
              xref='x', yref='y')
fig.update_layout(xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False)
fig.show()

Now I want to turn the segment into a line i.e., it still crosses the same two datapoints, but it now starts from the left of the plot area and ended on the right of the plot area (the purple one).

My first try was to find out the coordinate the datapoints on the canvas, so I can come up an equation of a line formula, thus calculate the start point and the stop point of the longer line, but I can't find such method that I can feed the raw data (for instance x being the time and y being the price of that time) and give me the canvas coordinate of that set of data (x being 0~1 and y being 0~1 or something else).
Is there a better way for me to plot a line across two data point? thanks!
