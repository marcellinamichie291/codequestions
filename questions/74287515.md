# What is the best way to move assets from Dropbox to an AWS S3 container?

Currently, I have 500GB of assets stored in Dropbox (Images, Videos, Doc, PDFs, etc.). I would like to move these assets to AWS S3 storage. Is there a connector available that allows me to move all 500 GB of assets to AWS S3? Is it necessary to download locally and then upload the 500 GB assets to AWS S3 first? Is there a better way to move assets?
