# Can't press buttons in Unity anymore

I'm creating a game in Unity, and I just added an inventory with multiple tabs (Inventory, Flora, and Bestiary). I put buttons on the tabs to switch between them and it was working smoothly until I tried creating a WebGL build. All of a sudden none of the buttons work. I didn't change anything, I have an event system and everything. I even tried deleting it all and remaking it and it still doesn't work. I'm an amateur at programming, so there's probably a better way to do it, but this is the code I have:
public void InventoryOpen()
    {
        inventory.SetActive(true);
        flora.SetActive(false);
        bestiary.SetActive(false);
    }

public void FloraOpen()
    {
        inventory.SetActive(false);
        flora.SetActive(true);
        bestiary.SetActive(false);
    }

public void BestiaryOpen()
    {
        inventory.SetActive(false);
        flora.SetActive(false);
        bestiary.SetActive(true);
    }

My buttons are properly routed to the functions on OnClick(), so I don't know what the problem is.
