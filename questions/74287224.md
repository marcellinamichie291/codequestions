# haskell Ordering type by values and its field

I have types like
data Fruit = Apple Date
           | Balana Date 
           | Orange Date

f = [Apple 2020-01-01 ,Apple 2020-02-01 
     ,Balana 2020-01-01 ,Balana 2020-02-01]

getDate:: Fruit -> Date
getDate (Apple x) = x
getDate (Balana x) = x
getDate (Orange x) = x

when sorting the list f by date field.
instance Ord Fruit where
    compare f1 f2 =  compare (getDate f1) (getDate f2)

But ,the question is , how to setup rule to order  Apple  2020-01-01 and Balance  2020-01-01 ?
what if I want to sort the date first ,if the date are same for different types of fruits, I would order Apple first , then Balance then Orange ?
[Apple  2020-01-01, Balance  2020-01-01, Apple 2020-02-01  ,Balana 2020-02-01]

Thanks !
