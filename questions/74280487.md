# bug in compilation of simple c program

the code:
/* find the greatest common divisor of two integers */
#include <stdio.h>
int gcd(int p, int q);

void main()
{
    int u,v,g;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d",&u,&v);
    g=gcd(u,v);
    printf("Greatest Common Divisor of %d and %d is %d",u,v,g);
}

int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    int m;
    m=a%b;
    if(m==0)
        return(b);
    else
        gcd(b,m);
}

is working properly on https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
the code is NOT working on macosx/ sierra with Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.4)
since the value of the returned variable 'b' does not get assigned to the variable 'g' in line 'g=gcd(u,v);'
'g' always gets the value of 0.
how could this issue be fixed on the mac?
could not find a workaround on stackoverflow.
