i make app use name route navigation so it can be an 'settings.argument' which can passed to next page, my problem is the output is {[{value},{value},]}, my question is how to access it because it map type and straight to List then there a value?
the real value/output is (i wanna make listview.builder button again):
{[{Topic: Additions, Color: MaterialAccentColor(primary value: Color(0xff69f0ae)), Definition: Additions is the way to merge some number, CoverImage: none, Sections: [{Section: Addition Introduction, Color: MaterialAccentColor(primary value: Color(0xff69f0ae)), Definition: in this section we will indtroduce the addition, CoverImage: none, QuestionList: [Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion']}]}, {Topic: SubTraction, Color: MaterialAccentColor(primary value: Color(0xffff4081)), Definition: Additions is the way to merge some number, CoverImage: none, Sections: [{Section: Subtraction Introduction, Color: MaterialAccentColor(primary value: Color(0xffff4081)), Definition: in this section we will indtroduce the addition, CoverImage: none, QuestionList: [Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion', Instance of 'QQuestion']}]}]}
