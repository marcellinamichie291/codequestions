# How to get Job version from allocation JSON that has no job information?

I have a persistent Nomad database of jobs, allocations and evaluations (with my own cleanup settings, not in the scope of the question). I take Nomad event stream https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/api-docs/events and listen to allocations, evaluations and jobs and save all JSONs to a database.
Allocations from Nomad event stream contain no Job information. I can get evaluation from allocation using "EvalID" field. I do not know hot to get Job version from evaluation. Evaluation JSON has only "JobID", it has no "JobModifyIndex", nor "JobVersion" field that I could connect to Job history.
How can I get which Job version is associated with allocation? Nomad UI shows that - how can I get that information using only Nomad event stream? Evaluation has "ModifyIndex" - can I use it?
