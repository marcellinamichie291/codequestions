# How to test if a parameter is passed into msi command line?

I am trying to install a msi file using msiexec on Windows. This msi can be installed either into the default ProgramFiles dir or a custom dir specified in the msiexec command.
For example when the custom dir is specified, the command looks like this:
msiexec /i installer_name.msi CUSTOM_DIR="C:\TEST" ALLUSERS=1

For this to work, I am changing a Wix file and creating Custom Action and Custom Action Id.
When CUSTOM_DIR is passed by the installer, then
<Custom Action='InstallAppCustom' Before='InstallFinalize'>VersionNT64 and (CUSTOM_DIR) and (ALLUSERS=1)</Custom>

and when the CUSTOM_DIR is not passed then
<Custom Action='InstallApp' Before='InstallFinalize'>VersionNT64 and (Not CUSTOM_DIR) and (ALLUSERS=1)</Custom>

My questions are:

Is this the right way to check whether CUSTOM_DIR is passed or not? or any other right way to check it?

The issue here is that, irrespective of whether CUSTOM_DIR is passed or not, InstallAppCustom gets executed in the InstallExecuteSequence.
