# Test functionality manually by adding maximum records in SQL table, how should i add those many records?

I have to test functionality manually where , if a background job  fails then a record is added in a table having columns Exception Id, Job Id, Job Name, Exception, Method Name, Service Name, etc. columns. At present there are around 25 background jobs in the application and i want to test the impact of adding maximum records in the table. How should I do that?  Or i have to manually fail jobs to add maximum record in the table (which is practically not possible, as the we can add unlimited records in the table)Is there any way?
I tried to manually fail the job, so that records can be added in the table, however, adding thousands of records manually is practically impossible.
How should i add maximum records in the table manually/ How should i test this scenario?
