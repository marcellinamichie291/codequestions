# create a package in Oracle PL/SQL for some frequently used code

during development, there are many codes/SQLs can be re-used, which is used to implement some kind of business logical. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, I propose to create a package, which contains these code/SQL/functions; then, any new code can call the functions/codes in this package and no need to write these frequently used codes again.
I wonder if the design is a decent solution for the scenario: avoid re-inventing wheel and decrease the lines of the code
