# How can I add a label to specific bars (not all) in a matplotlib bar?

I have built a bar chart that is showing value counts for every day in a year - I want to add labels to specific days, is this possible? I can only find examples where this applies to all. This is my code:
daychart = data.groupby(['Day'], as_index=False, sort=False).agg(Count=('Day','size'))
plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))
matplotlib.pyplot.bar(x="Day", height="Count", data=daychart)
plt.show()

This is what it looks like so far:

I want to (for example) label just 24 November (Thanksgiving) - How would I got about this?
Thank you :)
