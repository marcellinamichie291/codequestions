# error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error on Vue.Js Project

I have an error with my Vue Project when i run "npm run serve/build" syntax in terminal.
My npm node version is at v18.12.0 (with npm 8.19.2)
The error message is:
  opensslErrorStack: [ 'error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error' ],
  library: 'digital envelope routines',
  reason: 'unsupported',
  code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'

I have try to search the solutions, but many solution is for React and its not working.
