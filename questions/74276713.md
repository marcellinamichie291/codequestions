# Table Data Copy from Mysql to clickhouse using Mysql Engine Format

I am migrating data from RDS Mysql to ClickHouse using Mysql Engine.. I have created actual table structure in Merge Tree Engine and I have also created table using Mysql Engine by passing source RDS Mysql credentials to copy data to the actual Merge Tree engine table.. Data transfer is getting succeeded but count is not matching between Mysql(Source) and ClickHouse (Target)... Table count after data transfer completion is higher on Clickhouse side... Dont know how to fix this.. need ur valuable suggestions and input...
