# Using resolved promise data synchronously

I'm learning about promises and I absolutely want to make sure I am understanding their use before I continue. I am using a library for an online service which has functions which return a promise. 
Nearly all examples I read either use the resolved data in chained then() functions
const result = Library.functionReturningAPromise()
result.then(function(res) {
    const obj = new Example(res)
    return obj
}).then(function(ob) {
    // do the rest of the logic within these then() functions
})

or use the resolved data within an async function
async function test() {
    const result = await Library.functionReturningAPromise()
    const obj = new Example(result)

    // do the rest of the logic
}

I want to know if there is any way at all to use the data from a resolved promise in 'normal' synchronous code 
 const result = Library.functionReturningAPromise()

 // do something to resolve the promise

 const obj = new Example(result)

or if you need to always 'wrap' all your logic that uses the data from a resolved promise in an async function.
