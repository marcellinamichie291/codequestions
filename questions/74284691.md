# how to group a column in table where we need get maximum occurred value in second column in pandas

In Pandas I have a table
name sec
emp1 a       
emp1 a       
emp1 b       
emp2 a          
emp2 b       
emp2 c       
emp2 c       

i want to extract each name with max count of sec like
  name sec
  emp1  a
  emp2  c

in pandas in know we can use groupBy but do not know how to get this format.
df.groupby(['name','sec']).size()

this will give
name sec
emp1  a  2
      b  1
emp2  a  1
      b  1
      c  2

but I need  this way with maximum occurrence of sec
  name sec
  emp1  a
  emp2  c
