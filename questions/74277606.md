# How to find the root cause of "Element odoo has extra content: data"

The error message

"Element odoo has extra content: data"

may be generated if an xml file such as a view fails to validate against the RELAXNG schema file odoo/odoo/import_xml.rng. Unforunately it isn't very specific.  For example, this file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
  <data>

    <record id="record_id" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="name">foo.bar.form</field>
      <field name="model">baz.model</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form string="My Form">
          <sheet>
            <group>
              <field name="my_field"/>
          </group>
          </sheet>
        </form>
      </field>
    </record>

    <act_window id="action_quux" name="My Action" res_model="baz.model" view_model="form"/>

  </data>
</odoo>

will generate the message when validated, but there is no indication that the specific problem is that view_model should be view_mode. Is there a way to get a better error message?
