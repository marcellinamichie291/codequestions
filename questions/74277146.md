# Python os.path.exists fails with relative path with multiple "..", but works with absolute path

I am doing a simple os.path.exists() call but it's failing for a relative path with multiple .. while it succeeds with the absolute path. I've tested and found that the path is too long with the relative path. If I take off characters (extra in the example below) of the filename it works.
The examples below aren't exactly the length of failures, just for examples of the issue I'm facing.
# relative path - too long
os.path.exists(r'..\..\..\..\folder1\folder2\folder3\folder4\myfilename_extra.txt')  # fails
# removed `extra` at end of filename
os.path.exists(r'..\..\..\..\folder1\folder2\folder3\folder4\myfilename.txt')  # succeeds
# absolute path
os.path.exists(r'C:\Users\alex\folder1\folder2\folder3\folder4\myfilename.txt')  # succeeds

Could someone explain why the multiple uses of .. is causing the path to be too long and if there's a workaround. I can't use the absolute path either.
