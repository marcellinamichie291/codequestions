# Looking to sum whenever a new distinct value appears

I'm looking to see how to sum whenever a new distinct value appears without readding previous distinct values from prior months.
Trying to figure out how to create this "distinct category column"




Account
Month
Category
Distinct category count




Vendor 1
1
shirt
1


Vendor 1
2
shirt
2


Vendor 1
2
shoe
2


Vendor 1
4
shirt
2


Vendor 2
1
shirt
1


Vendor 2
2
shorts
2


Vendor 2
3
shirt
2


Vendor 2
5
shoe
3


Vendor 2
8
shorts
3


Vendor 2
9
shirt
3


Vendor 2
9
shoe
3


Vendor 2
9
shorts
3




For vendor 1 in month 2 we show "2" since a new category (shoe) is introduced. In month 4, continue to show "2" since shirt was already populated in months 1 and 2.
For vendor 2 after month 5 all three categories were introduced so all future months will be "3"
