I'm just getting started with Sagemaker and would love some advice and input.
I have a large dataset of contact information and I provide this dataset to clients to sell their services. My clients are now providing reports of the results of their efforts. So I can provide them better datasets how would you go about taking their results and correlating that to the entirety of my dataset and provide recommendations?
