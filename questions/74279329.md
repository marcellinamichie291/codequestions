# UIView background color not updated after setting width constraint dynamically

I have 3 UIViews next to each other.
Sometimes I have to dynamically hide some of the UIViews and adjust the width constraints of the remaining UIViews so that they fill up the remaining horizontal space.
I have IBOutlets to the width constraints of each UIView.
I dynamically change the width constraints.
For example like this:
if(secondView.isHidden == false && thirdView.isHidden == false){
      let topViewIconsWidth = (self.bounds.width - 4)/3
      firstViewWidthConstraint.constant = topViewIconsWidth
      secondViewWidthConstraint.constant = topViewIconsWidth
      thirdViewWidthConstraint.constant = topViewIconsWidth
    }

I then set the constraints to active:
  firstViewWidthConstraint.isActive = true
  secondViewWidthConstraint.isActive = true
  thirdViewWidthConstraint.isActive = true

I then call setNeedsDisplay like this:
      secondView.setNeedsDisplay()
      thirdView.setNeedsDisplay()
      secondView.setNeedsDisplay()

I even have the entire code block wrapped inside a DispatchQueue.main.async {
However I still get something like this:

As you can see there is a white space between the green UIView and the image on the right. I want to close this gap.
In the Hierarchy Debugger I see that the UIView's background color does not stretch to its entire width:
