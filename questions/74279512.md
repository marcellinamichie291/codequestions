How can I create a while loop in C# and increment the value
e.g; Write and run a C# program that calculates and displays the amount of money available in a bank
account that initially has $1,000 deposited in it and that earns 8 percent interest a year. Your
program should display the amount available at the end of each year for a period of ten years. Use
the relationship that the money available at the end of each year equals the amount of money in
the account at the start of the year plus .08 times the amount available at the start of the year.
**I am not able to loop in the output**
My CODE:




using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Que_9
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Year Balance");
            int year = 1;
            double DEPOSIT = 1000;
            double start = DEPOSIT;

            while (year <= 10)
            {
                double BALANCE = DEPOSIT + (0.08 * DEPOSIT);
                Console.WriteLine($"{year,-5}{BALANCE:C}");
                year++;
            }
        }
    }
}




MY OUTPUT:
Year Balance
1    $1,080.00
2    $1,080.00
3    $1,080.00
4    $1,080.00
5    $1,080.00
6    $1,080.00
7    $1,080.00
8    $1,080.00
9    $1,080.00
10   $1,080.00
Press any key to continue . . .

MY OUTPUT SHOULD BE LIKE THIS:
ear Balance
1 $1,080.00
2 $1,166.40
3 $1,259.71
4 $1,360.49
5 $1,469.33
6 $1,586.87
7 $1,713.82
8 $1,850.93
9 $1,999.00
10 $2,158.92
