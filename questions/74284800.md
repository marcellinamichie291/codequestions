# How to Collect the list of Third Party Jars used in our Maven Project

We are trying to collect all the thirdparty jars have been utilized in our project, so that we will have a control and clarification on the jars used by us.
Is there a Way to collect all the thirdparty jars have been used in maven project?
We are looking for any tool or command which will do this task for us.
Thanks in advance.
