# Python to control Arduino

I want to develop a machine learning algorithm that will control the traffic lights to optimize the traffic flow. For the DEMO, I'll like to figure out a way to control an Arduino with 4 Traffic Lights for cars and 4 Pedestrian Lights ( 20 LEDs in total ), but all the control must come from a Python script that will define the timings.
So the question would be:
How do I program the Arduino to read the code from the USB and run it ?
How do I write the Python script to send a new Arduino script to USB everytime the parameters change ?
Thank you !
