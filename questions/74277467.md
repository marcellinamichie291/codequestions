# passing one function to another inside a for loop

New to programming. I wrote a program that Asks the user to enter the name, age and shoe size for four people and adds it to a dictionary. In fact, it works even when I don't use one function as an argument for another function. However, when i try to pass get_user_info() to store_user_info it doesnt work. I also tried to pass get_user_info to three separate variables and then passed these variables to store_user_info and it still didn't work. I am probably making a dumb error. Sorry its kind of a basic type of query but I just started learning programming. Any guidance is appreciated.
FOLLOWING CODE DOESN'T WORK: IT RUNS THE FOR LOOP BUT NEVER PROMPTS FOR THE INPUT FOR MORE THAN ONCE
#get user info
def get_user_info():

    while True:
            try:
                user_input_name =  (input("What is your name "))
                user_input_age =  int(input("How old are you "))
                user_input_shoesize =  float(input("What is your show size "))
               
                break
            except (ValueError,IndexError):
                print('wrong selection or input')
    return user_input_name,user_input_age,user_input_shoesize

#Store user info
def store_user_info(user_info):
    user_information = {}
    for i in range(3):
        name, age, shoesize = user_info
        user_information[name] = {"age" : age,"shoesize": shoesize}

    print(user_information)
    return user_information

        =
store_user_info(get_user_info())



YET THE FOLLOWING WORKS and the loop works 3 times as expected:


#get user info
def get_user_info():

    while True:
            try:
                user_input_name =  (input("What is your name "))
                user_input_age =  int(input("How old are you "))
                user_input_shoesize =  float(input("What is your show size "))
               
                break
            except (ValueError,IndexError):
                print('wrong selection or input')
    return user_input_name,user_input_age,user_input_shoesize

#Store user info
def store_user_info():
    user_information = {}
    for i in range(3):
        name, age, shoesize = get_user_info()
        user_information[name] = {"age" : age,"shoesize": shoesize}

    print(user_information)
    return user_information
        

    


store_user_info()
