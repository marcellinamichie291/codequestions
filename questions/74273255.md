# SwiftUI: Remove focus from TextField when DatePicker becomes active

My use case is a form, where the user fills multiple information.
Therefore, I have a simple View with a DatePicker and a TextField.
First, the user enters data into the TextField, than selects a date in the DatePicker.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var date = Date()
    @State var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField(text: $text, label: { Text("Field")})
            DatePicker("Picker", selection: $date, displayedComponents: [.date])
        }
    }
}

My expectation / requirement is, that the TextField will lose focus, when the DatePicker is opened. This seems to work for the selection, the keyboard disappears. But when the user dismisses the DataPicker, the focus is back on the TextField. This might confuses the user, and probably prevents him from simply continuing in the process.
Any ideas how to make this work?
For reference, I have already tried this ideas:

Used a computable binding with side effects (and UIResponder.resignFirstResponder):

var wrappedDateBinding: Binding<Date> {
    .init(get: { date }, set: {
        date = $0
        UIApplication.shared.endEditing()
    })
}

and
extension UIApplication {
    func endEditing() {
        sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder), to: nil, from: nil, for: nil)
    }
}

This does not work.

Used a computable binding with side effects (and iOS 14 Focus API). Here, instead UIApplication.shared.endEditing() I set the focussed state to false. This also did not work.

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var date = Date()
    @State var text = ""

    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField(text: $text, label: { Text("Field")})
                .focused($isFocused)

            DatePicker("Picker", selection: wrappedDateBinding, displayedComponents: [.date])
        }
    }

    var wrappedDateBinding: Binding<Date> {
        .init(get: { date }, set: {
            date = $0
            isFocused = false
        })
    }
}
