# Kinesis Firehose: How to control what min. it writes data to S3

I am looking to write data to S3 from Firehose every 5 minutes or 10 minutes. However, I'd like to control what happens on the rounded-off min i.e 5:10, 5:15, 5:20, etc instead of 5:12, 5:17, 5:23, and so on.
This is because of how the users select the time range and could otherwise result in missing data for a couple of recent minutes.
Is there a way to achieve this?
