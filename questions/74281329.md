# How to generate in PHP all combinations of items in multiple arrays where the first array may not be combined by itself

I am looking for a way to combine all possible combinations of items in an array which contains multiple arrays. However, the first array in the multiple array may not be combined by itself.
The following is what I am looking for. This is my parent array:
Parentgroup =>
'group1' => array('test1','test1_1','test1_1_1'),
'group2' => array('test1_2','test1_2_2','test1_2_2_2',),
'group3' => array('test1_3_1','test1_3_3','test1_3_3_3'),

I want that the first array combine other rows not itself.
array('test1','test1_1','test1_1_1')

I tried the function below:
function array_cartesian_product($array)
{
    if (empty($array)) return [[]];

    $column = array_shift($array);
    $cartesian = $this->array_cartesian_product($array);

    $result = [];
    foreach ($column as $row) {
        foreach ($cartesian as $item) {
            array_unshift($item, $row);
            $result[] = $item;
        }
    }
    return $

I get the following output which contains multiple arrays inside a array which is good:
> {array} [3]
0 = "test1"
1 = "test1_1"
2 = "test1_1_1"

> {array} [3]
0 = "test1"
1 = "test1_1"
2 = "test1_2_2_2"

However, I want that the first array:

array('test1','test1_1','test1_1_1')


does not get combined. I want something like this:
{array} [3]
0 = "test1"
1 = "test1_2_2_2"
2 = "test1_3_3_3"

{array} [3]
0 = "test1"
1 = "test1_2_2"
2 = "test1_3_3"

{array} [3]
0 = "test1"
1 = "test1_2"
2 = "test1_3_1"

{array} [3]
0 = "test1_1"
1 = "test1_2_2_2"
2 = "test1_3_3_3"


And so on...
Where the values of the first row are used to combine with the other array values.
