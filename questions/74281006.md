# Is there a way to query AWS RDS instance by its tag values?

As per this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html, you can only filter RDS instances with the following filters
--filters (list)
db-cluster-id
db-instance-id
dbi-resource-id 
domain
engine

In my AWS environment, I have consistent tags for the service/application and env. Thus, I want to retrieve RDS instances by their tags similar to what we do with EC2s.
Has someone gotten around it?
