# Select value from excel drop-down for each cell

I have a drop-down in my excel, I want to select an individual value from the drop-down for each cell. I have 8000 cells in one column in MS excel. I want to do it this way: when I click on the first cell, it will choose the first value from that dropdown. when I click on the second it automatically chooses the second. It should do it until I click on 8000 and automatically select the 8000th value from the dropdown.
All i want is, when I click on first cell it will choose value from drop-down and then click on next cell it will choose next value from drop-down not the previous one and so on
