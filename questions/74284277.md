# Read from a dynamoDB to a node js application

I'm trying to pull data from a table I've created in AWS ‚ûù DynamoDB. Whatever I try, I always get the messages:

"Missing credentials in config, if using AWS_CONFIG_FILE, set AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1"
or
"The security token included in the request is invalid"

Do anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?
I've tried:
-updating/deleting the credentials files located inside .aws
ssss
