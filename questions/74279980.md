# By using Selenium grid 4 running the Script on Specific Node

I'm new to Selenium Grid 4 and trying to setting up the grid with Node & Hub Mode and run the test.For example, Below is my setup:
Hub: windows
Node A: windows chrome_v103 ip:192.168.1.1
Node B: windows chrome_v103 ip:192.168.1.2
If I run a test case, sometimes it run on Node A, sometimes on Node B;How can I run a test in specific node, For example in node A, Not Node B
running node by specifying node name if its have the same browser
