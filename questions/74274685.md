# Try to find folder name "temp.dll" by using Directory.Exsits()

I'm having a problem with what i asked on the title.
In my program, I'm trying to wrap a dll file with folder.
When I made the folder name as same as file name and try to find existance with Directory.Exists func...
it doesn't work.
[Detail Example]
string fileName = "C:\User\Installprogram\Temp.dll"   //<- "Temp.dll" is Directory
if (!Directory.Exists(fileName))
   return false;

I double checked if the directory is in proper place.
Weird point is other folder names properly return true with above example.
I'm sort of guessing if folder name contains ".dll" making unable to catch directory by Directory.Exists func.
Help me
