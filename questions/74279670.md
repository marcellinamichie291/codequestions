# Android Studio xml layout autocomplete not working

I'm using Android Studio version 2021.1
as shown  bellow in the GIF the auto-complete doesn't work if I changed the "ConstraintLayout" to any other layout such as "LinearLayout" or "RelativeLayout", but it works just fine with "ConstraintLayout".


What i've tried so far is:

Deleting AS cache from ~/AppData/Local/Google/AndroidStudio2021.1/caches
Deleting .idea from my project
Creating new xml layout :/
