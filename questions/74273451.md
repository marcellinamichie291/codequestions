# Query Local serial ports using the Hosted Django Website in IIS

I have a code for querying and listing serial ports on my local machine.Now my problem is when I host the app in the IIS because it now only lists the serial ports in that server machine. Is there a way I can twerk this to list the ports that are in my local machine too?
Or am I doing the wrong thing?
Here's the code.
def retrieve_ports():
      
    """ Lists serial port names

        :raises EnvironmentError:
            On unsupported or unknown platforms
        :returns:
            A list of the serial ports available on the system
    """
    if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
        ports = ['COM%s' % (i + 1) for i in range(256)]
    elif sys.platform.startswith('linux') or sys.platform.startswith('cygwin'):
        # this excludes your current terminal "/dev/tty"
        ports = glob.glob('/dev/tty[A-Za-z]*')
    elif sys.platform.startswith('darwin'):
        ports = glob.glob('/dev/tty.*')
    else:
        raise EnvironmentError('Unsupported platform')

    result = []
    for port in ports:
        try:
            s = serial.Serial(port)
            s.close()
            result.append(port)
        except (OSError, serial.SerialException):
            pass
    print("available ports===",result)
    

    return result
