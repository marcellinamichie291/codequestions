# View serial com port information through CMD Prompt

For example, there is software out there like USBDeview/USBLyzer that you can use to view all of your COM ports and information on it. Like my USB devices / etc.
Like for example, here is a screenshot of USBLyzer:

I can use this: Get-WMIObject Win32_SerialPort | Select-Object Name,DeviceID,Description in PowerShell to see a list of COM ports. But how can I find information like USB Lyzer does?
Like USBLyzer finds information like the description/deviceid but also information like the manufacturer, the product name, the serial number. It seems like it is based off of a specific value
I tried researching many commands but I can't find anything to do what USBLyzer does. How would this software do it?
