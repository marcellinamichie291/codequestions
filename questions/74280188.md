# How do I select a div with a class name that ends with a specific string and keep the text content?

So I'm using Puppeteer to scrap text from social media, I want to only scrap the text from a post, when I use the chrome developer tool to read what is the class name of the div which contains the text, it always displays a different class name when I reload the page but stay on the same post(see image)


But I noticed that the div class name always ends with .text-content, is there a way to select a div with only the end of the class name?
I tried to use the $ selector like this :
document.querySelectorAll("[class$='text-content']")

And yes it finds the correct div but if I try to use .textContent or .innerText it doesn't work and it returns undefined.
I also tried to select all divs from the developer console and then see if I could use the index of this div but it turns out that the index also changes every time I reload the page
What I wrote in the developer console :
document.querySelectorAll('div')

and then it gave me an array of divs but as I said I can't use that if the index changes every time.
