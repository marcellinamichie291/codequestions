# Convert measurements that have aggregate values to changes between measurments

Every 5 minutes, my server reports value of total writes to specific hard drive. This value is an aggregate, so when I chart it in a line graph, it always goes up.

I'm looking for a way to convert those total values to changes between time periods on which measurements are made. So I want to see spikes on my chart when something is written to hard drive and value equal to zero when nothing is written. How can I do that?
