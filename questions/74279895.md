# Is there a Helm chart for installing Tekton pipelines?

I'm using Tekton (https://tekton.dev/) to run CI/CD pipelines on top of Kubernetes and I'd like to deploy multiple pipelines one for each environment eg. DEV/UAT/PREPROD/PROD, has anyone seen a helm chart to deploy pipelines?
I have tried deploying the necessary Kubernetes objects using kubectl apply for my DEV pipeline but when going to deploy UAT/PREPROD/PROD pipelines there's far too much duplicated code. So I would like to use Helm package manager to have a single pipeline template and deploy my pipelines using that template via a helm install command.
Side note: I have to use Tekton as the CI/CD tool to satisfy pipeline deployment requirements; cloud-agnostic, run pipelines locally in Kind and running each pipeline stage with least-privileged security by assuming IAM roles in AWS.
