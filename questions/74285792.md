# Cant access the data sent from $.ajax POST method in my PHP part of program

So i'm doing a college project and this project requires me to send data assigned by clicking on buttons to my PHP part of the code and using that data through PHP to run a query to my database and display the products accordingly.I have never used PHP by the way.
And the problem as the  title says i cant get any data on any PHP variable.
This is part of the code i use to assign values to angular JS variables(no problem here)
 <div ng-show="Q1==3">
                    <p>What type of games do you intend to play?</p>                                                <!--Gaming-->
                    <input type="button" value="Competitive FPS or Esports Games" id="Esports" ng-click="GamingQ1=1;refrate=120;resol=1080">
                    <input type="button" value="RPG or JRPG Games" id="RPG" ng-click="GamingQ1=2">
                    <input type="button" value="Indie Games" id="Indie" ng-click="GamingQ1=3">{{refrate}}
                        <div ng-show="GamingQ1!=0">
                        Please enter your budget:<input type="number" ng-model="Budget">
                            <div ng-show="Budget!=0">
                                <input type="button" value="Ask BABA" ng-click="search=1;pass()">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                </div>

This is my code i use to pass Angular Js variable to PHP(the alert doesen't show)
$scope.pass=function()
                {
                    $.ajax({
    method: "POST",
    url: "index.php",
    data: {
        'refrate':JSON.stringify($scope.refrate)
    },
    dataType:'json'
}).success(function (data) {
    alert("done");
});
                }

and here is what the network tab in browser looks like which confuses me if the data is sent or not

and this is how im trying to recieve ajax data
I also tried to assign values to PHP variables using $variablename="{{Angular_variable_name}}";
This method works but only for echo statements.If i try to use the variable directly or indirectly in the query it doesent work because when i later checked the string length with strlen() it returned length of 11 for what should be only 2 or 3 digits in the string.
