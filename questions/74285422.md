# How to modify a final Map in java

I am using JAVA 8 and trying to modify a final Map , problem is that map is serving the live transformation logic so if i try to clear it and then modify it ,there will be some missed transformation
private final Map<String, Set<EventMapping>> registeredEvents = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
 Map<String, Set<EventMapping>> newRegisteredEntries = eventMappingDBWrapper.getActiveEventMapping();
            if (MapUtils.isNotEmpty(newRegisteredEntries)) {
                registeredEvents.clear();
                registeredEvents.putAll(newRegisteredEntries);
            }

My concern is if i call clear() then map will be empty untill putAll() is called in the next line , and in the mean time if some events need fetching of these mappings ,it will create problem , as we are processing 1M event per minute.
Is there any way to safely execute it ?
