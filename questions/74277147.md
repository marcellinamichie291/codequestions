# How shall I create my dim table using actual dim tables and doing an inner join or using select distinct from my fact table

-- Optional Read
Background: My company has a data model which according to myself is in 2NF stored in an Oracle DB. It has a fact table that has foreign keys and fields with transitive functional dependencies. The db contains tables which can be used as fact and dimension tables. We don't have a data warehouse so I am guessing we are using the OLTP format for storage.

My question is when I create the fact and dim tables using sql queries for Power BI. When selecting from for my dim tables shall I select from the actual dimension tables in my db and do inner joins with the fact table or shall I just do a select distinct from the foriegn key and the transitive dependency field in the fact table applying the same filters I applied to the fact table?
p.s very limited resources on writing effecient sql queries related to Power BI if anyone can share some links highly appreciate it thanks.
