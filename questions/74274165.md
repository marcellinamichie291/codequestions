# ADF adding equals condition to existing if condition

I have an if condition in an ADF activity like below:
@if(    
    contains(activity('LookupWmkLastUpdateConfig').output,'firstRow')
    ,greater(
        activity('LookupLastUpdateSrc').output.lastModified
        ,activity('LookupWmkLastUpdateConfig').output.firstRow.NewValueWatermark)
    ),
    false)

The if condition looks as the last update date in src vs my database. Want I want to include is an additional block of code that evaluates an outside parameter called TypeLoad.
The current set-up only allows for full loads, I want to be able to include delta loads.
Does anyone know how to include such a piece of logic to the existing if code?
equals(pipeline().parameters.FwkItem['TypeLoad'],1)

The above condition would for example evaluate the full or delta load.
All help is very welcome.
Thanks!
