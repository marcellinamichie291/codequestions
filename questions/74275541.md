# Printing an invoice in Safari - result "Attention. Something went wrong"

Anyone saw the error while we trying to print an invoice - "Attention. Something went wrong." in Magento 2.4.3-p1
I got this error only in MacOS with Safari!
In Chrome in MacOS - everything is fine!
I checked several online demo instances and find same error here - https://magento2-demo.magebit.com/admin/ as magebit/Demo123. Magento 2.4.0
After login to admin panel open an any invoice:

Sales - Invoices - View an invoice - Print.

After that you must to see this error.
In other demo instances I can't reproduce this error - with version of Magento 2.4.2 at least.
Tested in MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and Safari 11.1.6 in Virtual machine.
And with real Mac - Mac OS Ventura / Safari Browser Version 16.1.
