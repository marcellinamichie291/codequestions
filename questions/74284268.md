# Unity Start animation on specific frame not working

I tried looking all over the internet, but cannot figure out why this is not working. I have a 16 frame animation clip (.anim). This script is attached to my prefab which only has Sprite Renderer and Animator as components.
just starts at frame 1 when I play. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you
void Start(){
Animator Animat = GetComponent<Animator>();
Animat.Play("the .anim file name", 0, 5);
}
