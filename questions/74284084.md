# Why is member "name" of "struct qstr" in the kernel the string "UDP", "UNIX"?

I need to get the file path, and when I get to "struct qstr" I find that in some cases I get a string like "UDP" or "UNIX", why is that? thank you!
My search path looks like this: struct dentry -> struct qstr
Looking forward to your reply!
