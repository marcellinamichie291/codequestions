# How to add total to the Data Table of a Line Chart without showing in chart?

I've googled this and found some answers. However, they all seem to be not applicable to my situation.
I want the chart to be presented like this.

But, I can't figure out a way to hide the total in chart and the y-axis scale has been scaled up to match the total data.


I could think of drawing a new column for the total while not including total in data selection.
Port two charts and overlap the one without total with the one with total.


I tried to format the points on the graph, but the point is they don't appear to be "series total" as the chart is presented horizontally. But I don't want to revert x and y axis. Now, I cannot come up with any solutions. Please help:(
