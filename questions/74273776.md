# How do I determine the scope of a Stimulus controller?

Say, we have a Stimulus controller that toggles a sidebar. The button that triggers the toggle action is located in different places, though, depending on the device. E.g. in the header when you are on a mobile device and in the main navigation when you are on a Desktop device.
What do you do in this situation? Is it better to initialise 2 Stimulus controllers (one in the div that belongs to the header and one that belongs to the main navigation) or to initialise just one Stimulus controller, for example in a wrapper div tag that encloses both the header as well as the main navigation?
