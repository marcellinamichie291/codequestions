# How to let 2 vm communicate while IP subnet mask different

I have 2 vms to be created

IP 192.168.2.55, subnetmask 255.255.255.250

IP 192.168.2.66, subnetmask 255.255.255.251


The xen management network uses
IP 172.18.2.30 , subnetmask 255.255.255.0
This is the network with Internet services, so VM can access Internet and corporte network drive.
What should be the proper way of configuration?
I am using xcp tool for configuration.
