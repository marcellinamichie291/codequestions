# MUI data grid boolean cell type conditional formatting

Is there a way to conditionally format MUI datagrid cell that has a 'boolean' type.
Here is a sandbox from documentation with a checkbox column that has a boolean type: https://codesandbox.io/s/1ckfjp?file=/demo.tsx:1771-1855
const columns: GridColumns = [
    ...
    {
      field: 'isPaid',
      headerName: 'Is paid?',
      type: 'boolean',
      width: 140,
      editable: true,
    },
    ...

Is using cellRender (in cols definition (https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/column-definition/#rendering-cells)) the only way to render my own green or red icons depending if value is true or false? Or is there a better way?
