# starting learning C++, been asked to write a Russian peasant algo with vectors in steps. done the halfling and doubling done not sure how to do adding

#include <iostream> // library containers 
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number1 = 0; // declaring the variables for the entered numbers
    int number2 = 0;
    int Result = 0;
    vector<int>vec1; //declaring the vectors type and name
    vector<int>vec2;


    //Getting input for value one from the user.
    cout << "Please enter the first number:" << endl;
    cin >> number1;
    cout <<  "Your first entry divided by 2 continuously is : " << endl;
    
    //adding the first input to the first vector.
    vec1.push_back(number1);  

    //Halfing the first number until it reaches number 1 using a while loop.
    while (number1 > 1)
    {
        number1 = number1 / 2;
        cout << number1 << " ";
        vec1.push_back(number1);  //adding the result to vector 1
    }
    cout << endl;

    //Getting the second number from the user.
    cout << "Please enter the second number:" << endl;
    cin >> number2;
    cout << "Your second entry multiplication is : " << endl;

    //Adding the second input to vector 2
    vec2.push_back(number2);

    //Creating a for loop to initialise how many times we double the second number.
    for (int i = 0; i < vec1.size() -1; i++)
    {
        number2 = number2 * 2;
        cout << number2 << " ";
        vec2.push_back(number2); //Adding the result to vector 2
    }

    cout << endl;


How do I identify the odd elements in vec1 and add the same corresponding element from vec2 to result?
sorry if its a bit messy, I just started learning
I have not tried much because I'm unsure of were to start
