# Graphs - what is the functional difference between "pure" Dijkstra and my hybrid BFS-Dijkstra solution?

I am (or was supposed to, at least) make a Dijkstra implementation, but upon reviewing what I've done it looks more like a breadth-first search. But I wonder if I have come across a way to kind of do both things at the same time?
Essentially by using an OOP approach I can perform a BFS that also preserves knowledge of the shortest weighted path, thereby eliminating the need to determine during the search process whether some node has a lower cost than its alternatives like Dijkstra does.

I've searched for clues as to why a more "pure" implementation of Dijkstra should be faster than this, most prominently the answers in these two threads:
What is difference between BFS and Dijkstra's algorithms when looking for shortest path?
Why use Dijkstra's Algorithm if Breadth First Search (BFS) can do the same thing faster?
I haven't seen anything that made me understand the question to what I'm wondering, though.

My approach is essentially this:

Start at whatever node we require, this becomes a "path"
Step out to each adjacent node, and each of these steps create a new path that we store in a path collection
Every path contains an ordered list of which nodes it has visited from the starting node all the way to wherever it is, as well as the associated weight/cost
Mark the "parent" path as closed (stop iterating on it)
Select the first open path in the path collection and repeat the above
When there are no more open paths, delete all paths that didn't make it to the destination node
Compare the lengths and return the path with the lowest weight

I struggle to see where the performance difference between this and pure Dijkstra would come from. Dijkstra would still have to iterate over all possible paths, right? So I perform exactly the same number of steps with this implementation as if I change returnNextOpenPath() (serving the function of a normal queue, just not implemented as one) to a more priority queue-looking returnShortestOpenPath().
There's presumably a marginal performance penalty at the end where I examine all the collected, non-destroyed paths before I can print a result instead of just popping from a queue - but aside from that, am I just not seeing where else my implementation would also be worse than "pure" Dijkstra?
I don't think it matters, but in case it does: The actual code I have for this is gigantic so my first instinct is to hold off on posting it for now, but here's a stripped down version of it.
class DijkstraNode:
    def getNeighbors(self):
        # returns a Dict of all adjacent nodes and their cost

    def weightedDistanceToNeighbor(self, neighbor):
        # returns the cost associated with traversing from current node to the chosen neighbor node
    return int(self.getNeighbors()[neighbor])


class DijkstraEdge:
    def __init__(self, startingNode: DijkstraNode, destinationNode: DijkstraNode)
        self.start = startingNode
        self.goal  = destinationNode

    def weightedLength(self):
        return self.start.weightedDistanceToNeighbor(self.goal)


class DijkstraPath:
    def __init__(self, startingNode: DijkstraNode, destinationNode: DijkstraNode):
        self.visitedNodes: list[DjikstraNode] = [startingNode]
        self.previousNode = self.start
        self.edges: list[DijkstraEdge] = []

    def addNode(self, node: DijkstraNode)
        # if the node we're inspecting is new, add it to all the lists
        if not node in self.visitedNodes:        
            self.edges.append(DijkstraEdge(self.prevNode, node))
            self.visitedNodes.append(node)
            self.prevNode = node
        
        # if the node we just added above is our destination, stop iterating on this path
        if node = self.goal:
            self.closed = True
            self.valid  = True


class DijkstraTree:
    def bruteforceAllPaths(self, startingNode: DijkstraNode, destinationNode: DijkstraNode):
        self.pathlist = []
        self.pathlist.append(DjikstraPath(startingNode, destinationNode))

        cn: DjikstraNode

        # iterate over all open paths
        while self.hasOpenPaths():
            currentPath = self.returnNextOpenPath()
            neighbors: Dict = currentPath.lastNode().getNeighbors()

            for c in neighbors:
                cn = self.returnNode(c)

                # copy the current path 
                tmpPath = deepcopy(currentPath)

                # add the child node onto the newly made path
                tmpPath.addNode(cn)

                # add the new path to pathlist
                if tmpPath.isOpen() or tmpPath.isValid():
                    self.pathlist.append(tmpPath)

            # then we close the parent path
            currentPath.close()
