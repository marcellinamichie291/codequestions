How do I type hint a method with the type of the enclosing class?

Take a look at this code:
class Test:
    def __eq__(self, rhs: Test):
        # ...
        pass

The code fails with the following output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    class Test:
  File "test.py", line 2, in Test
    def __eq__(self, rhs: Test):
NameError: name 'Test' is not defined

How do I use a type hint of a class in the class method arguments itself?
