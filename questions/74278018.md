# Efficient way to query more than 50 BigQuery projects data

I'm trying to write a query that fetches data from more than almost 50 different BQ projects.
I'm using union all but it's not an efficient way to write 'union all' 49 times for 50 different projects. Is there any way to efficiently fetch data from all projects?
I used this query
SELECT '1' AS id
FROM `d-1.daataa.table`

UNION ALL

SELECT '2' AS id
FROM `d-2.daataa.table`
