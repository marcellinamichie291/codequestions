# Pros/Cons of ES6 import of class with static methods vs object

It was suggested in ES6 Module: Shared class best approach that exporting an object would be better than a class with static methods/properties.
There is also an old (2013) topic JavaScript classes vs objects, pros and cons? which only compares function with object, and not as a module import.
In ES6 import modules (and in browser extension environment), what are the pros/cons of a class with static methods/properties (e.g. set of utility functions) vs an object?
mod.js
export class ClassWithStaticMethod {
  static staticProperty = 'someValue';
  static staticMethod() {
    return 'static method has been called.';
  }
}

mod-alt.js
export const ClassWithStaticMethod = {
  staticProperty: 'someValue',
  staticMethod: function() {
    return 'static method has been called.';
  }
}
