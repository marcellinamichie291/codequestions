# Is it possible to make changes in Field Service App form and affect Project App in Odoo

I am new to Odoo. I have both Project and Field Service app installed. They both inherit from project.task model. It seems anything I change in Field Service form changes Project form as well (such as moving around the fields or deleting a field). I am doing the changes using Odoo Studio.
Is there a way for me to be able to change the Project app or the Field Service app and not affect the other?
Thanks
I have tried changing the inheritance mode from extension view to base view as I read that it will make each view separate.
