System.out.println("unesti jedan ceo pozitivan broj");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();     
                          
           
           if(n <= 0) System.out.println("number n must be higher then zero");
            else{
                System.out.println("divident of number n are : ");  
                for (int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++)
                     if(n % i == 0) System.out.println(i);
            }

i need to optimaze this code. how can i do that?
