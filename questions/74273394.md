# returned non-zero exit status 120

I wrote a piece of code that was supposed to run the airflow list_dags command via subprocess.
    dags_raw = subprocess.check_output(
        'airflow list_dags', shell=True
    ).split()

I get the following error message
File "/usr/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 411, in check_output
    **kwargs).stdout
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 512, in run
    output=stdout, stderr=stderr)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'airflow list_dags' returned non-zero exit status 120.

I'm able to run airflow list_dags directly from the server. I couldn't find the right solution. I'd appreciate it if anyone could help with this.
