# how to test logic inside except block python

I have a function(lets say a()) where i am using try except block and inside try block i am calling one function (lets say b())which also have try except block, so basically is exception arises in b() raise it and after raising it will come out of b() except and control will go to except of a() and in except block of a(), i am putting if condition like if exception name ="some exception coming from b()" then raise that exception else  raise whatsoever exception is there.
so here i want to test that particular if condition inside except block of a() in unittest.
def a():
    try:
        #do something and call b()
        b()
    Exception as ex:
        if isinstance(ex, somecustomexception):
                        raise ex
        else:
             #some other logic
def b():
    try:
        #some logic
    except :
       raise somecustomexception


I want to test logic of exception block of function a(), mostly i want to test if block.
