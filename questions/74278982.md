# Intellisense with python's namedtuple

I've been studying python's implementation of namedtuple and noticed that Intellisense in VSCode is able to provide suggestions for dynamically generated attributes and fields for namedtuple.
from collections import namedtuple

A = namedtuple('Zoo', 'lions bears tigers') # type of A is Type[Zoo]
a = A(0, 0, 0)                              # typing A(...) provides (lions, bears, tigers) -> Zoo
a.lions                                     # as you type a. you get lions, bears and tigers 

I know this usese some form of static analysis and static-time-value-unification mechanism to deduce the variables' available fields in the namedtuple.
What I would like to do is to have the language server in VSCode provide suggestions for custom classes that I write with dynamic attributes as well. I've even tried copy-pasting python's implementation into a separate file to see if Intellisense is picking up on the dunder attributes but it seems to fail.
How can I add include support for dynamically generated classes in the language server?
Here is a simplest snippet of a custom class that would be dynamically generated:
def boo(self):
    return 69

def coo(self):
    return 'wow'

def implements(*attrs):
    def x(class_type, class_parents, class_attrs):
        for i in attrs:
            class_attrs[i.__name__] = i
        return type(class_type, class_parents, class_attrs)
    return x

class Foo(metaclass=implements(boo, coo)):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def get(self):
        return self.y

a = Foo(1, 2)
print(dir(a))
print(a.boo())  # No support from intellisense despite boo being known ahead of time
print(a.coo()) 
print(a.get())  # typing a. provides get() as a hint

Is there a method or reference I can get to allow Intellisense to deduce Foo's methods and attributes?
Thanks in advance!
