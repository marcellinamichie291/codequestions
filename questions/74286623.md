# Collection was modified error when removing a row from a DataTable

I am trying to loop through a DataTable and during that loop I am comparing each row to another DatabTable and then if the record matches remove the row. The resulting DataTable then gets put into a DataGridView.
However I am getting the following error:

System.InvalidOperationException: 'Collection was modified;
enumeration operation might not execute.'

Im not 100% sure but I think its because I am modifying the Table that is being looped through? But if that is the case how do i then remove the rows that are duplicates?
My code is as follows:
foreach (DataRow dr in dtM1.Rows)
{
    int matchCount = 0;
    string id = dr["cmoOrganizationID"].ToString();
    
    foreach (DataRow dr2 in dtSQLite.Rows)
    {
        //MessageBox.Show(id + " "+ dr2["sSupplierID"].ToString());
        if (dr2["sSupplierID"].ToString() == id)
        {
            matchCount++;
        }
    }

    if (matchCount > 0) 
    {
        dtM1.Rows.Remove(dr); 
        MessageBox.Show("Item to remove" + id);
    }
}

dgv.DataSource = dtM1;
