# How to authenticate with Firebase via service account key?

I'm trying to understand how to authenticate on the firebase-cli via service account key.
I downloaded a service account key via my admin console, and managed to successfully authenticate via gcloud-cli:
➜ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file gcloud-service-key.json         
Activated service account credentials for: [firebase- adminxxx0@xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com]

When I try to fetch the projects, it fails:
➜ firebase projects:list
✖ Preparing the list of your Firebase projects

Error: Failed to list Firebase projects. See firebase-debug.log for more info.

Having trouble? Try again or contact support with contents of firebase-debug.log

and when I visit my log file:
[debug] [2022-11-01T15:16:35.589Z] > command requires scopes: ["email","openid","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudplatformprojects.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]

Am I missing something?
TIA.
