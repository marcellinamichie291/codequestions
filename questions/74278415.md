I noticed through a mistake when completing an excel task that the maximum row limit is 1,048,576. Is there a setting or some VBA that can limit an excel workbook to have a maximum row limit of less than 1,048,576?
For example, lets say I have a workbook that really would never go above 2,000 records. Is there a way to set it so that no matter what, a record greater than number 2,000 could not exist?
Looked all over online, could only see users wanting to increase the limit!
