# Move substring to front of string

I have a field "Numbers" that can have a value such as:
"01-02-03-04-Zero"
I want to change the substring "Zero" to "00" and move it to the front of the string, so that the result is:
"00-01-02-03-04"
Not all rows contain this "Zero" substring so I only want to perform this on fields that do.
