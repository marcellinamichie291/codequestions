# What’s the equivalent for Oracle’s SQL PARTITION BY keyword in DolphinDB?

I have the following table:




id
grade
score




A
1
50


A
3
55


A
2
65


A
4
60


B
4
40


B
1
55


B
2
50


B
3
45


C
1
70


C
2
80


C
4
90


C
3
100





“grade“ ranges from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest).

Here’s what I want to do:
For each id, return the sum of each grade’s score and the score of the next higher grade.
