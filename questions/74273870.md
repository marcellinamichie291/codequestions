# JointJs - Discarding the command in CommandManager.cmdBeforeAdd

In my JointJs application, I want to discard particular commands so that they are not added in the Undo/Redo stack.
I followed the exact same code snippet from the JointJs documentation like below:
var commandManager = new joint.dia.CommandManager({
    graph: graph,
    cmdBeforeAdd: function(cmdName, cell, graph, options) {
        options = options || {};
        return !options.ignoreCommandManager;
    }
});

// ...

// Note that the last argument to set() is an options object that gets passed to the cmdBeforeAdd() function.
element.set({ 'z': 1 }, { ignoreCommandManager: true });

But when I look into the options object in the debug mode, it doesn't contain any property with the name ignoreCommandManager.
I have also tried the below call to set the z value but it didn't work either.
element.set('z', 1 , { ignoreCommandManager: true });

Any idea why the options object is missing this property to ignore the command, please?
