# creating a user in Azure AD and after the creation the user should be put in the owner group of a SharePoint Site

I would like to create user in Azure ID. After the user is created, the user should be put into the SharePoint Owner group. I'm doing this with PowerAutomate. The user hasn't go any licenses. Just existing in the Azure AD.
After I created the user with PowerAutomate I get the error message "user not found".
Maybe you can help me.
Here is my flow so far:

Flow02
Best regards
