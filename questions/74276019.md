# Python Object Orientation

Can somebody help me with this task as I do not understand it fully? Thanks!
Create a 'code' cell below. In this do the following:
Create a super class "Person" that takes three string and one integer parameters for first and second name, UK Postcode and age in years.
Give "Person" a method "greeting" that prints a statement along the lines "Hello, my name is Freddy Jones. I am 22 years old and my postcode is HP6 7AJ"
Create a "Student" class that extends/inherits "Person" and takes additional parameters for degree_subject and student_ID.
Give "Student" a "studentGreeting" method that prints a statement along the lines "My student ID is SN123456 and I am reading Computer Science"
Use either Python {} format or C-type %s/%d notation to format output strings
Create 3 student objects and persist these in a list
Iterate over the three objects and call their "greeting" and "studentGreeting" methods
Output should be along the lines of the following:
Hello, my name is Dick Turpin. I am 32 years old and my postcode is HP11 2JZ
My student ID is DT123456 and I am reading Highway Robbery
Hello, my name is Dorothy Turpin. I am 32 years old and my postcode is SO14 7AA
My student ID is DT123457 and I am reading Law
Hello, my name is Oliver Cromwell. I am 32 years old and my postcode is OX35 14RE
My student ID is OC123456 and I am reading History
After the "greetings" function I just cannot find a way out because the task is looking too big.
