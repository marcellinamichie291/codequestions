# Class method decorator with arguments

So, here's a method:
def evaluate(self): return self.left ** self.right

And it can raise an OverflowError if the result is too big.
To fix it (or convert to a different exception), you can e.g. decorate it:
def overflow_adapter(method):
    def wrapper(self):
        try:
            return method(self)
        except OverflowError:
            raise ValueError("Result is too big!")
    return wrapper


@overflow_adapter
def evaluate(self): return self.left ** self.right

What I want to achieve is to be able to decorate methods with a specific decorator, which converts multiple different exceptions to one specific:
@exception_adapter(aware=[OverflowError,], response=ValueError("Result is too big!"))
def evaluate(self): return self.left ** self.right

I would write something like this (... are places I don't know how to complete:
def exception_adapter(...):
    def wrapper(...):
        try:
            return method(self)
        except BaseException as e:
            if e in aware: raise response
    return wrapper

How can I make this work?
