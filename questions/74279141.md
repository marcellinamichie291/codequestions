# How to implement iter.collect::<Vec<Vec<_>>>()?

Iterator::collect can transform iterators into so many different structures. So, I was expecting that the following would just work:
let it = (1..5).map(|x| (x..5));
let xss = it.collect::<Vec<Vec<_>>>();
// let xss = it.map(|xs| xs.collect::<Vec<_>>()).collect::<Vec<_>>(); // clunky 

No luck, unfortunately. How can such functionality be implemented?
