I have the following series
1 3 6 11 18 29 42 59 78 101 130 161 198
239 282 329 382 441 502 569 640 â€¦..

640 is a descending number. The digits from left to right are in descending order.
239 is an ascending number. The digits from left to right are in ascending order.
329 is neither ascending nor descending.
441, 101, 282, 11 all have a digit occurring more than once.

How can I generate this series?
1
1 +  2  = 3
3 + 3  = 6
6 + 5 = 11
11 + 7 = 18
18 + 11 = 29
.
.
502 + 67 = 569
569 + 71 = 640
640 + 73 = 713 and so on up to 10,000.
