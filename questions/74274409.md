# Getting a value by using find in json object [javascript]

I received the below JSON and having difficulty retrieving the value of jersey_num.
const json = [{
    $: {
        Type: "first_name"
    },
    _: "Evan"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "last_name"
    },
    _: "Ferguson"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "birth_date"
    },
    _: "2004-10-19"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "weight"
    },
    _: "Unknown"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "height"
    },
    _: "Unknown"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "jersey_num"
    },
    _: "28"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "real_position"
    },
    _: "Striker"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "real_position_side"
    },
    _: "Centre"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "join_date"
    },
    _: "2021-08-23"
}, {
    $: {
        Type: "country"
    },
    _: "Republic of Ireland"
}]

I tried using the below code but received undefined
const jersey = Object.entries(json).find(([, e]) => Object.values(e).includes('jersey_num'))
console.log(jersey)

I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with the above code. Hope someone can help and guide me on how to retrieving the jersey_num value
EDIT

Edited the JSON object to the proper format
The value that I want to retrieve is '28' as in Type: "jersey_num"
