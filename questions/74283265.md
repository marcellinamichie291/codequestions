# Font color matching the background

I have a container for the whole app that has a gradient background. In this container is an element that is moved into the screen with the help of an animation. The element has a white background and should take on the colour gradient of the top element as the font colour, so that it is virtually transparent instead of the font.
The structure looks something like this:
<div class="app" style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh; radial-gradient(...)">
    <div class="elements-container">
        <div class="element-1">example 1</div>
        <div class="element-2">example 2</div>
    </div>
</div>

In this case, is it possible to clip the gradient onto the text in any way?
