# How to update properties of object in Mongo Schema?

I have a mongo model like this:-
var mongoose = require("mongoose");

const postModel = new mongoose.Schema({
    postId: {
        type: String,
        unique: true,
        required: true
    },
    authorId: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    post: {
        authorName: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        heading: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        message: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        creationDate: {
            type: Date,
            required: true
        },
        image: {
            data: Buffer,
            contentType: String
        }, 
        likes: {
            type: Number
        },
        likedUsers: {
            type: Array
        },
        dislikes: {
            type: Number
        },
        hearts: {
            type: Number
        },
        dislikedUsers: {
            type: Array
        },
        heartedUsers: {
            type: Array
        },
        comments: {
            type: Array
        }
    }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("postModel", postModel);

Now what i wanna do is take a record from this model and update the like property of the post object to what it previously was and increment that by 1.
How do I do that inside the api call body?
My api call body looks like this for now:-
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const PostModel = require("../models/postModel");

router.post(`/api/like-post/`, (req, res) => {
    const { postId, postAuthorId, likeUserId } = req.body;

    //What to do here?
});

module.exports = router;

I am doing the api call from a react frontend on click of a like button.
Any and all help is greatly appreciated!
