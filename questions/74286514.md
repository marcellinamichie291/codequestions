# Debezium Source - JDBC Sink - Date out of range

I have Debezium in a container, capturing all changes of PostgeSQL database records. In addition a have a confluent JDBC container to write all changes to another database.
While the operation is in progress, after a while i am receiving the following error:
ERROR: timestamp out of range: "290303-12-10 19:59:27.6+00 BC"
My configuration on source about datetime:
"time.precision.mode": "connect",

After a carful investigation, I saw that inside the failing table there are dates with value '-infinity'...

Based on PostgreSQL documendation, infinity and -infinity exists:
PostgreSQL supports several special date/time input values for convenience, as shown in Table 8.13. The values infinity and -infinity are specially represented inside the system and will be displayed unchanged; but the others are simply notational shorthands that will be converted to ordinary date/time values when read. (In particular, now and related strings are converted to a specific time value as soon as they are read.) All of these values need to be enclosed in single quotes when used as constants in SQL commands.
I also see that this has been fixed on Debezium 1.5.0-Beta based on the Issue https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2450 but i have Debezium 2.0.0. Lastly I see that now this is a JDBC issue and not Debezium so i tried to update JDBC from 10.4.0 to 10.6.0 but nothing changed.
Any ideas how I can fix that?
