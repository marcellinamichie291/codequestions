# BeautifulSoup findall get text but return empty

I am scraping a website and would like to find specific content based on style, so I do
soup.find_all('style')


and it does return some result/text, but once I use .text soup_name.find_all('style')[0].text to extract the text, it returns an empty string

What can I do to extract the text in the style tag?
