# Trouble with maven / com.smartbear.soapui / Xerces

when using com.smartbear.soapui-maven plugin, 4.6.4 I always get the error:
"Could not find artifact org.apache.xerces:xml-apis:pom:2.10.0".

(When not using smartbear.soapui... everything works out perfectly).
Although xerces 2.10.0 is most definitly available in our nexus and after
the maven build Xerces 2.10.0 is also present in my local maven-repository, but
still the maven-build ends up with the above error message.
Any ideas what's the problem with the smartberat.soapui-maven-plgin 4.6.4 ?
(Java-Version used for the build is 11.0.9)
