# Codes shown on GitHub differs from what really are

The code appearing on my GitHub is not exactly the some as the one which I've written and can be downloaded.
Here exactly what I mean:
the link to my repository is
https://github.com/stefanovic80/PythonMap/blob/master/Python_Map_ipyleaflet.ipynb
which is a jupyter notebook code. The issue comes into the first cell, which on GitHub appears like this
from IPython.display import display, HTML
display(HTML(""))
display(HTML(""))
display(HTML(""))

but this is not what I've written, not what I was able to read few days before, not even what I get on my local machine once I've cloned it!
Hence, something happenend recently, but I don know what!
In fact, once cloned, on my machine I can have the right lines of code which are
from IPython.display import display, HTML
display(HTML("<style>.container { width:100% !important; }</style>"))
display(HTML("<style>.output_result { max-width:100% !important; }</style>"))
display(HTML("<style>.prompt { display:none !important; }</style>"))

What's happening?
I would like to have the opportunity to copy and paste the code directly from my GitHub whenever I need it, without passing through a cloning procedure. Could you suggest me anything, please?
