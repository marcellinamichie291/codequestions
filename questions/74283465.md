# I am getting a blank page when i open my github pages link for my react app. How can i get my Github Pages for Create React App working properly?

I have a single page react application that works perfectly fine on my local machine, but when i deploy the app to GitHub pages it runs but does not actually display my application. I know it runs because i noticed i am not getting a 404 page, or even a blank white screen but a screen with the background i chose, and when i change the background in the code and redeploy, the background gets updated. When i check the console, the only error i get is the one i attached. 
and 
I am trying to get the application to show up when deployed to GitHub pages rather than just displaying a blank app.
