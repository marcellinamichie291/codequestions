# ImportError loading spacy in jupyter notebook

I got a problem I can't seem to figure out. The first time I imported Spacy into a Jupyter notebook I had no problems. It just imported it as I expected.
The second time I tried to import it (using a different notebook) I got:
ImportError: cannot import name 'prefer_gpu' from 'thinc.api' (C:\python-environments\nlp\lib\site-packages\thinc\api.py)

So I tried to restart the kernel and tried it again (thinking that might be the issue). That did not solve it. Also trying to run the same cell that imported Spacy in the first notebook also throws the error now after it went well the first time.
