# how to download a file from a sibling directory in react

I have a react component which I need to download a static file I have in an adjacent folder, I've tried loading the file using
import myFile from '../../myfile/myfile.pdf'

<Button onClick={(evt) => this.handleDownload(evt)}><a href={myFile} download="My_File.pdf">Temp Download BTN</a></Button>

but when I try to import that, it throws the error below
Cannot find module '../../myfile/myfile.pdf' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)
