# How to access data in an iteration when reading a csv with pandas

I have a problem that I cannot solve.
I would like to be able to do the following when reading a csv
At each iteration, I can access a column by its name from the csv
I tried the following code but was unsuccessful
products = pandas.read_csv(f'./storage/temp/{file_name}', delimiter=',', on_bad_lines='skip').to_dict()
        
        for index, product in products:
            print(product.product_url)

csv example data
product_url,image_url,categories,attributes,description,product_name,reviews,stock,sku,product_gift,price,price_with_discount,categories_urls
