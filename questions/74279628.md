How to merge two csv files using python and create a merged csv file. I tried below code from available sources but was not able to attain my requirements.
def merge_csv():
# reading csv files
data1 = pd.read_csv('C:/folder/csv1.csv')
data2 = pd.read_csv('C:/folder/csv2.csv')
# using merge function by setting how='outer'
output4 = pd.merge(data1, data2,
                   how='outer')
print(output4)
# I tried below code to create new csv but not working. I dont want to create a csv manually instead create automatically.
output4.to_csv('C:\\folder\\merged.csv')
               or
with open('C:/folder/merged.csv', 'w+', newline='') as data:
     dict_writer = csv.DictWriter(data)
     dict_writer.writeheader()
     dict_writer.writerows(output4)

Finaly I am trying to merge both columns .
examples

   id  name
   1   abc

  dept   location
  cse     xyz
