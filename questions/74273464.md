# Excel Custom Ribbon button not working when file moved to different location

Thanks for viewing my thread. Could you please help me?
I have Some questions about Excel Custom Ribbon (Currently Using office 365).

In One Excel File I have created Custom Ribbon through macros. It was working fine. But if I move that file/rename the file the Custom Ribbon won't work.

If I export the Custom Ribbon options. In Exported File Custom Ribbon Macros location/directory is hard coded like where we have created. When a different user imports the custom ribbon. The macros trying to run from my directory.


So could you please help me with this?
