# Why am I getting a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" with basic division function?

The program is supposed to do integer division and show the remainder. It should check the if the denominator is 0 and allow the user to correct it. However, when the denominator is 0 and a non-zero integer is re-entered, I get a segmentation fault. Could someone explain why and how I can rectify it. I also get a number of warnings. I am kind of new to using pointers.
Here is my code (C):
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    
    int n, d, den, rem;
    int *dvd = &den;
    int *rmn = &rem;


    printf("Enter the numerator: ");  //prompt a user to enter an integer numerator
    scanf("%i", &n);
    printf("%i\n", n);
    printf("Enter the denominator: ");//prompt the user to enter an integer denominator
    scanf("%i", &d);
    printf("%i\n", d);    


    int division (int numerator, int denominator, int *dividend, int *remainder) {
        
          while (denominator==0) {
            printf("Number cannot be 0!\n");
            printf("Enter another number ");
            scanf("%i", denominator);
          }
        
        dividend = numerator/denominator;
        remainder = numerator%denominator;
        printf("%i/%i = %i with %i remainder\n",n, d, dividend, remainder);

    }

    division(n, d, *dvd, *rmn); // call the function division

    
    return 0;
}

I have tried using the address of the denominator instead of the pointer which did not work. I also tried nesting the while loop in an if function.
