# Display an specific HTML text in batch file

I'm making a batch program to show recent updates based on a .HTML document. I wanted it to read exactly the "October 26, 2022" part (seen below), completely ignoring the other codes and put it in a variable.
Part of the document I want to read is based on this:
<li><span>Current version:</span><span>**October 26, 2022**</span></li>

I would implement it inside this batch code with the !CurrentVersionDate! variable
FOR /L %%i in (1,1,%count%) DO (
call :GetLastModifiedDate "!File[%%i]!" LastModifiedDate
    echo ::------------------------------------------------------------------
    echo DLL File: "!file[%%i]!"
    echo Version date: "!LastModifiedDate!"
    echo Current version: "!CurrentVersionDate!"
    echo ::------------------------------------------------------------------
)

As I said, I wanted it to be displayed without the HTML codes, like
::------------------------------------------------------------------
DLL File: "!file[%%i]!"
Version date: "!LastModifiedDate!"
Current version: October 26, 2022
::------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I tried to use for /F "skip=385 delims=" %%i in (page.html) DO set "LastModifiedDate=%%i, it shows the following result:
Current version: Current version:</span> <span>  October 26, 2022  </span></li>

I also tried FINDSTR /C:"Current version" page.html, but it was useless, because it showed the same thing and I didn't have the variable in my hands.
Any suggestions?
