# Code verification error when uploading AAB: "Files added after transparency metadata generation"

We have a problem with uploading the next version of the application. We use code transparency for bundle and when we try to upload to Google Store it returns an error:
An error occurred while running bundletool build-apks on your uploaded App Bundle. Ensure that your App Bundle is valid by running bundletool build-apks locally and try again. Learn more. Error: Verification failed because code was modified after transparency metadata generation. Files deleted after transparency metadata generation: [] Files added after transparency metadata generation: [/com/android/tools/build/bundletool/archive/dex/1_8_2/classes.dex] Files modified after transparency metadata generation: []
It took the previous (and first) version normally. At first I thought it was due to obfuscation, see documentation:
Known limitations
Apps using anti-tamper protection or any other service that makes code changes after the code transparency file is generated will cause the code transparency verification to fail.
So I tried turning it off, but it didn't help. I tried to generate APKS locally, that was no problem, as well as the local code-transparency verification went fine. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any mention of this problem anywhere at all.
