# How to pass &arr to a function in c

I simply want to pass an &arr in C language.
For example:
#include <stdio.h>

void test( PARAMETER??? )
{
    return;
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
    test(&arr);
    return 0;
}

How should I declare the parameter?
As it is of type int (*)[8]
I simply want to pass &arr in C language. I know I can pass arr and length argument, but how can I via this?
