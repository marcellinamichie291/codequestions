# Inserting a custom handler anywhere in a wordpress URL

I have some custom posts that I need to be able to list and link to at various points around a site.
They are case studies and I want to make them contextually relevant to services, which are currently just pages.
Ideally I want to be able to insert 'case-studies' into a URL, have it recognised and then either list relevant posts if there is nothing following it, or display the post based on the slug that follows case-studies.
EG:
/service1/case-studies - lists all case study posts relevant to service1
/service1/case-studies/blah displays the 'blah' case study post
In the above service1 is just a page. The URL might even be
/service1/subservice/case-studies
/service1/subservice/case-studies/blah
I'm thinking that relationships will handle the relevancy - so a case-studies listing will look up all case studies related to the slug preceding 'case-studies' in the url (so in these cases subservice or service1)
I've looked at wp-router (https://github.com/jbrinley/WP-Router) but I'm not sure how I can use the slugs preceding the case-studies marker to query for relevance.
Anyone had any luck with useful URL routing in Wordpress?
