# Ternary operator rendering nothing in React when variableis equal to 0

I am trying to render a React component on click of another component.
The onClick I set a savedId to be the eventKey of the component to render the correct data related to that specific index the array.

onClick call

 <ListGroup>
                {data.map((item: any, i) => (
                    <ListGroup.Item key={i} action eventKey={i} 
onClick={() => {setSavedId(i); console.log(i)}}>
                        {item.first_name} {item.last_name}
                    </ListGroup.Item>
                ))}
 </ListGroup>

The issue here is that when my savedId is equal to 0, nothing renders but when it is > 0, the component with the correct data is rendered.

Ternary

  <Tab.Pane eventKey={savedId}>
                                 
{savedId ? <Accordian data={data[savedId]} /> : null}
  </Tab.Pane>

My first thought was that since 0 is a "falsy" value, the condition is taking that as false and returning "null" as specified, but I've tried using the !! operator and the && operator and no luck...

!

    <Tab.Pane eventKey={savedId}>
                                 
{!!savedId ? <Accordian data={data[savedId]} /> : null}
    </Tab.Pane>


&&

{savedId && <Accordian data={data[savedId]} />}


! AND &&

{!!savedId && <Accordian data={data[savedId]} />}


This was my hacky solution and it worked at first but once the page was refreshed the data came back undefined when the savedId was 0

{savedId ? <Accordian data={data[savedId]} /> : <Accordian data={data[0]} />}

Not really sure how to make this line defensive enough to deal with savedId being equal to 0. Not sure why Typescript is freaking out about it.
Thanks.
