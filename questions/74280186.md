# Perplexing ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got DATE when using Oracle's Analytic Functions

When I create this view and query the results, an ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got DATE is received.
create or replace view test as

SQL> desc test
Name                     Null? Type   
------------------------ ----- ------ 
FIRST_TRANSACTION_DATE         DATE   
TOTAL_DAYS                     NUMBER 
TRANSACTION_DATE               DATE   
TRANSACTION_AMOUNT             NUMBER 
TOTAL_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT       NUMBER

I tried isolating the issue to the total_days field, but to no avail.
After describing the view, the data types seem to be correct.  Any ideas?
