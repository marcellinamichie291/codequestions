# Azure IoT Hub custom endpoint device to cloud messages reliability

This page mentions that the maximum retention time for device-to-cloud messages is 7 days for built in endpoint.
I imagine that doesn't apply to custom endpoints e.g. service bus endpoint? If that's the case, does that mean if service bus is unavailable or say topic is unhealthy, messages would get lost?
It seems like when service bus endpoint is unhealthy, IoT Hub still accepts the message from device, so device wouldn't know if the backend really got the message or did it get lost?
I couldn't find this info in documentation, any suggestions on message reliability with custom endpoints would be much appreciated.
