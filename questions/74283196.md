I trying to correct the code:
class A(object):
    def foo(self, x):
        print("executing foo(%s, %s)"%(self, x))


    @classmethod
    def class_foo(cls, x):
        print("executing class_foo(%s, %s)"%(cls, x))

    @staticmethod
    def static_foo(x):
        print("executing static_foo(%s)"%x)

to get such output for the commands:
a = A()
A.foo(a,123) # ditto
A.class_foo(123) # ditto

How to correct this code to get ditto output for this commands?
