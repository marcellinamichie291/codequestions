# Unencrypted VPN over lwip

I'm looking for a way to provide a way for our embedded devices scattered all over the country, some in lenient, some in restrictive networks to talk to each other.
I'm not looking to secure this connection, all exchanged data should be regarded just as unsafe as if they had been sent over the internet. No authentication is required anyone should be able to "join" this internal network in the public internet network, and communicate with the devices. The devices themselves will take care of that, as if they would be on the real internet. The decision to authenticate and trust any information is to be handled by the devices themselves.
The sole purpose would be to give the devices and anyone who wishes to communicate the feeling that they are on the same (internal) network.
The embedded devices do not run a traditional os, they run freertos, and use lwip as a protocol stack.
I was thinking of implementing a VPN, but they are all about securing and encrypting the connections which I don't need, but would take precious resources which are scarce for embedded devices.
There seems to be some wireguard support for lwip, but they specifically don't want to allow unencrypted tunnels.
Read some stuff about GRE, but not sure how to get started.
Basically I'm looking for a VPN without the private part.
Any other ideas?
