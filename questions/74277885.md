# Include existing .resources file in VS project

I have a .resources file containing media (image, audio & text items). I would like to include it in a VS project so the resource items are available within the generated assembly.

If I include it with a build action of "Embedded Resource" I get the entire .resources file as a single item.
If I set build action to "Resource" the data is omitted entirely.
ResGen.exe cannot convert the file to a .resx file because, so it tells me, some of the items are not serializable.

As far as I can make out, .resource files are designed to be compiled or linked into output assemblies, so this feels like it should be straightforward. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
