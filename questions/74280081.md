# Is it possible to have the web app called within the DialCallStatus or <number> statusCallback url pass info back that would interact w TaskRouter?

I have a function that updates worker activity via updating worker activitySid. Is it possible to trigger function that through a web app that is at the action URL within  when dialCallStatus = "complete" or  statusCallback = "complete" through the statusCallback URL?
I have gotten each piece working separately, but not sure if the TwiML response required from Action Urls or statusCallback urls can be written in a way that updates taskrouter from a voice call.
