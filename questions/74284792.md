# What is difference between Lucene Expression language and painless language in Elasticsearch, as I am getting different result for same query

I running a Elasticsearch query for a average of date difference calculation via using Lucene Expression language as below:-
"avg": {
            "script": {
              "source": "(doc['lastFixed'] - doc['firstFound'])/ (1000*60*60)",
              "lang": "expression"
            }
          }

The output is as below :
"aggregations": {
  "nest-path-aggr-namevulnerabilities": {
    "doc_count": 75537,
      "having-aggr-name": {
        "doc_count": 3104,
         "vulnerabilities.firstFound": {
            "value": 6691.012234124427
          }
       }
    }
 }

But when I try the same logic with the painless script language, the output is different.
The painless script is as below:
"avg": {
            "script": {
              "source": " (doc['vulnerabilities.lastFixed'].value.toEpochSecond() - doc['vulnerabilities.firstFound'].value.toEpochSecond() )/ (1000*60*60); ",
              "lang": "painless"
            }

The output is coming as this:-
"aggregations": {
  "nest-path-aggr-namevulnerabilities": {
    "doc_count": 41208,
       "having-aggr-name": {
         "doc_count": 1933,
           "vulnerabilities.lastFixed": {
              "value": 7.73150543197103
            }
         }
      }
   }

What is the difference between both of the lang types ?
