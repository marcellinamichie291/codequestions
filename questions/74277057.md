# determine Eps for DBSCAN algorithm

here is my code for  calculating nearest Neighbors within given dataset
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors # importing the library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
neighb = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2) # creating an object of the NearestNeighbors class
nbrs=neighb.fit(X) # fitting the data to the object
distances,indices=nbrs.kneighbors(X) # finding the nearest neighbours
# Sort and plot the distances results
distances = np.sort(distances, axis = 0) # sorting the distances
distances = distances[:, 1] # taking the second column of the sorted distances
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (5,3) # setting the figure size
plt.plot(distances) # plotting the distances
plt.show() # showing the plot

corresponding picture is given as :

i have read that for  selecting Epsilon (Eps) , i  should take maximum curvature , so in this case  if we consider elbow rule, then our Epsilon would be between 15 and 20 right? or  am i making some mistakes? please advice me
