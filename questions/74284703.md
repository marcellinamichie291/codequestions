CD-2123


9/20/2022
CD-2123


10/21/2022

Could someone share a Kusto query that works with above data and get a new columns which has the latest Customer Order when data is order by data and group by customer id. The most recent order for  customerId would start with zero or one.
Thank you for your help in advance.
