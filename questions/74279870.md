# why last output also varies in this block of python code?

I can understand first output of first example, that is 2 as the i += 1 makes value to 2 than print calls, I also understand the second example's first output that is 1 because print calls i then increment begins. But, what about the end, as we have already defined "while i < 6:" then why first example returns last output as 6 (why don't it breaks to 5)
I'm a beginner so treat me like a kid and write the answer that is easy to understand. Thank you! :)
i = 1
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    print(i)  # Print output after i increment, see the result
>> The output is -
2
3
4
5
6

i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)  # Print output before i increment, see the result
    i += 1
>> The output is -
1
2
3
4
5

I was expecting the output should be limited to 5 but it returns to 6 (in first example)
