# Removing a file list .xls

I'm interested in removing .xls files from a list in the glob library,
I want to removing this list by the os library.
Here is my code :
import os
import glob


location = "C:\user\Documents\"
file_xls = glob.glob(location + "\*.xls")
os remove(file_xls)


And this is my Error message
TypeError: remove: path should be string, bytes or os.PathLike, not list

Thanks in advance for your answer !
