# How to improve this loop to group objects based on one field

I'm trying to improve my code a little bit but not sure if it is even possible.
I have sqlalchemy model which contains fields like category, name, img_path.
After I fetch all of the objects, I need to group them into categories to get the following result:
[{"category":"some category", "skills":[{"name": "some name", "img_path":"some path"}...]}...]
currently it looks like this:
skills = db.query(model.Skill).order_by(model.Skill.category).all()

    _categories = {}
    for skill in skills:
        if skill.category not in _categories:
            _categories[skill.category] = []
        _categories[skill.category].append(
            {"name": skill.name, "img_path": skill.img_path}
        )

It works but I believe it might be more elegant
It would be nice to have some hints how to improve this code
