Tried making a list but couldn't get the one variable to stay the same through the code loops it keeps resetting to the new name and new score. is there any way I could keep the highest score and its holder throughout the loops?
it should keep the name from the start if that name has the highest score and the program runs again and that player has a lower score should print the first name and first score, if it's higher it should print the second name with the second score.
