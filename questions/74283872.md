# Why does my timer only change when the score changes? I want it to count down like a normal timer

This is supposed to be a typing game, by the way. I'm trying to have it so that the timer counts down from 30 to zero and the score goes up each time you get an input correct.  I've managed to get the timer and score onto the screen, but the timer only goes down 1 when the score goes up 1. How can I get it so the timer acts independently of the score? I just want it to count down from 30 seconds to 0 and display "Time's up" when its finished.
