# How to check when was last time the User logged in?

I would like to update my model if the user did not logged in the day before .

    @receiver(post_save, sender=user_logged_in)
    def user_logged_in_streak(sender, instance,  *args, **kwargs):

        today: date = timezone.now().date()

        if instance.user.last_login == today - timedelta(days=1):
            UserStatisticStatus.objects.update(day_streak=0)
        else:
            pass
```
