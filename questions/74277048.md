# How to make a public forked repository to personal private repository in github?

I have to fork a public repository from another github account in which the visibility cannot be change to private. But after forking it into my account, I need to make the repository to private. How should I do this?
I only tried changing the visibility. That is already set to public and cannot be changed.
