I'm working on a RoomPlan app. I've successfully managed to capture, save and load scans using NSKeyedArchiver. However, for apps run on the simulator or on devices without a LiDAR Scanner, I do not have any scans saved on that device so I cannot test the functionality. I want to "fill" my app with a test scan or two to be able to test my app on those devices.
The core problem here is that I can't figure out how to "capture" objects in Swift and save them hardcoded in the app instead of in NSKeyedArchiver, which is local to every device.
