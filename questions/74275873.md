# Why is it necessary to use bind when working with ES6 and ReactJS?

Using ES5 development with ReactJS, a component can be stated as the following:
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  alertSomething: function(event) {
    alert(event.target);
  },

  render: function() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.alertSomething}>Click Me!</button>
    );
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);

In this example, the this references the object itself, which is the expected natural behavior.
Question
My question is:
How you use ES6 to create components?
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  alertSomething(event) {
    alert(event.target);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.alertSomething.bind(this)}>Click Me!</button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);

Knowing that in JavaScript the this references the instantiated object itself when using the new operator, someone can tell me what is the real purpose of using bind? It is something related to the internal mechanisms of React?
