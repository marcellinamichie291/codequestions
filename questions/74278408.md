# Is it secure to log in a user without a password?

I am thinking of logging a user in to my Django website by verifying the email rather than them having to write a password.
If this is not clear, this is what I'm thinking:

User enters email
User gets a email containing a code
User enters code in website
User is logged in

Is this safe to do without hackers accessing the accounts of other users?
