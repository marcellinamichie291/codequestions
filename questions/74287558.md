# Can't firgur out why I can't get an SSL certificate

I want to setup my nextcloud, running on trueNas, in a way I can access it from anywhere.
I tried following this guide, but I keep getting errors when trying to use certbot to get an SSL certificate.
This is my netxcloud.conf in the nginx.conf.d:
"nextcloud.conf" 34L, 937B written
root@nextcloud:/usr/local/etc/nginx/conf.d # cat nextcloud.conf
upstream php-handler {
    server unix:/var/run/nextcloud-php-fpm.sock;
}

# Redirect to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80;

    location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge {
        # Path to the root of your installation
        root /usr/local/www/nextcloud/;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location / {
       return 301 https://$host:$NEXTCLOUD_HTTPS_PORT$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name nextcloud.testsleeve.ddns.net;

    # HSTS settings

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains;" always;

    include conf.d/nextcloud.inc;
}


When running certbot --nginx -d nextcloud.testsleeve.ddns.net I get this error:
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Error while running nginx -c /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -t.

The nginx plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
The error was: MisconfigurationError('Error while running nginx -c /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -t.\n\nnginx: [warn] "ssl_stapling" ignored, no OCSP responder URL in the certificate "/usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/truenas/fullchain.pem"\nnginx: [warn] "ssl_stapling" ignored, no OCSP responder URL in the certificate "/usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/truenas/fullchain.pem"\nnginx: [emerg] unknown "nextcloud_https_port" variable\nnginx: configuration file /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed\n')


I have a static ip via noip and exposed the ports 443 and 80 for my TrueNas server, if that helps with anyting.
