# Alexa Device Input-Output Object-Oriented Design

I was asked below question in Amazon interview. I was rejected in that round. I searched in internet but could not find a good solution for this problem.
Design OOPs for Amazon Alexa devices - Echo Show and Echo Dot. These devices have different input(touch, voice), output(sound, display) and power(battery, plug-in) mode. Your Design should handle different input & respond with the correct output when Alexa is asked about its battery status(i.e. X% charged or plugged-in).
