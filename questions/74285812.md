# WooCommerce Notice Wrapper

My shop page back-end is using WooCommerce + elementor.
The cart page is boxed to avoid a messy layout look on larger screens:

the top section is stretched to full width:

Issue:
The woo notice that appears when you update your cart quantity or remove an item from the cart appears as a boxed view (as it coincides with the width of the "cart" section - which is set to boxed- 1200px)
How can I have "just the woo notice set to full width (no matter the screen size) without needing to make my whole shop page full width?
*I tried to set the wrapper to (width: 100vw), but no luck
