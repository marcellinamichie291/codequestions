# How could I use ReorderableListView when displaying a list of potentially identical items?

The ReorderableListView widget requires all children to have a unique Key.
I wish to display a reorderable list of plugins in use in my application. One feature of this application's design is that the same plugin can be added to the plugin list in multiple positions (and by same, I mean the same, identically equal object).
Due to this possibility of the same plugin appearing twice in the list, the only property unique to each list item is its position. This is not an adequate value to use in a Key, though, as it changes when items are re-ordered; avoiding this is the exact reason why a Key is required in the first place.
How could I use a ReorderableListView in this scenario?
