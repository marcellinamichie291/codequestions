# Trying to delete rows from Excel_File_1 that matches the column field 'B' on Excel_File_2 using pandas

Excel_File_1 contains fields [A , B, C, D, E, F, G]
Excel_File_2 contains fileds [G, F, A, B]
Column 'B' is an ID. So I want to remove the rows with the ids from Excel_File_1 present in Excel_File_2. There are multiple rows with similar ids. Same entity but different locations but I want all of them gone.
Delete rows from Excel_File_1 if any field in column 'B' matches any field in column 'B' of Excel_File_2?
Excel_File_1[~Excel_Field_1.loc[:,'B'].isin(Excel_File_2['B'])]
Idk Excel but people keep telling me to use Vlookup but the file is huge so I doubt Vlookup will work
