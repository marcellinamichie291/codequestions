# Upload multi files with curl

I need help with command curl using POST. There may be many similar threads here, but none offer a solution to my problem. I want upload multi files with curl. When I add only one file works without problem, but when i try to upload many files with one command only first file uploaded. I use this command:
curl --user xxxx:xxxx --request POST 'https://example.com/xxxx/xxxx?cmd=upload' --form "file=@dummy2.properties" --form "desc=myfiles" --form "file1=@dummy3.properties" --form "desc=myfiles"
I tried too this command:
curl --user xxxx:xxxx --request POST 'https://example.com/xxxx/xxxx?cmd=upload' --form "files=@dummy2.properties,dummy3.properties" --form "desc=myfiles"
What is wrong?
Thank you.
I expect to upload multi files, but can upload only 1 files.
