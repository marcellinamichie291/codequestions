# SQL: How to create a table when the condition is that the data in two columns from two different rows for the same ID be the same?

I have a table of duplicates.
I'd like to create a new table of duplicates where two columns: (1)start_date (2)return_date are the same. E.G. where start_date = return_date
Issue: the start_date = return_date are on different rows for the same ID.
Data example:
ID  Start_Date   Return_date
A   11/1/21      12/15/21
A   12/15/21     12/20/21
B   11/1/21      12/22/22
B   12/25/22     12/30/22

In this example, I would want ID A to be pulled into my new dataset, because ID A has a start_date = return_date. (12/15/21)
Here's one examples of many that I've tried and failed.
proc sql;
create table new as
select distinct ID, start_date, return_date
from 
old_table
where (start_date = return_date);
