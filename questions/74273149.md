# how to pass input field value to variable inside form in php

i have a form in my php codeigniter website, the form is like below:


<form ......>
<input type="text" id="yesCheck"  name="camount"  />
<?php
$grand_sum = $this->input->post('camount');

$payment_message = trim($MerchantID) . "|" . trim($CustomerID) . "|NA|" . trim($grand_sum) . "|NA|NA|NA|INR|NA|R|" . trim($SecurityID) . "|NA|NA|F|" . trim($application_id) . "|" . trim($user_id) . "|" . trim($grand_sum) . "@0|20210511@20210525|".$subbiller."|".$typep."|".$name."|" . trim($url_response) . "|" . trim($checksum_value);

                                                ?>
<input type='hidden' name='msg' value='<?php echo $payment_message; ?>'>
</form>



what i need here is to pass the value from the input box to the variable $grand_sum, i cannot pass it after form submit, i need to pass it before the form submission, is there any way to accomplish this, thanks in advance
