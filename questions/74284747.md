# how does uri link of firebase verification email works?

I know I have similar problems of verification of emails but I want to know how does the actionCodeSettings works in firebase basically on this link..I don't understand the uri android and ios links thingy..I don't know how can I connect it with a link like the sendSignInLinkToEmail or sendEmailVerification becuz they both have the actionCodeSettings
If its on gmail how do I link it or maybe facebook or maybe twitch or whatever platform it is??
Here is my sample code
    const actionCodeSettings = {
        url: 'https://accounts.google.com/',
        // This must be true.
        handleCodeInApp: true,
        iOS: {
          bundleId: 'com.example.ios'
        },
        android: {
          packageName: 'com.example.android',
          installApp: true,
          minimumVersion: '12'
        },
        dynamicLinkDomain: 'example.page.link'
    }
....


    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

    function handleSubmit(e) {
        e.preventDefault()
        
        setLoading(true)
    
        sendEmailVerification(user,actionCodeSettings)
        // sendEmailVerification(user?.getIdToken)
        // .then(res => {
        //     console.log(res)
        // }).catch(err => {
        //     console.log(err)
        // })

        setLoading(false)

    }

This on my Verification.jsx I want to the signInLinkEmail but it is just similar with sendEmailVerification because of actionCodeSettings how do I fix it? I don't understand the actionCodeSettings...
Can anyone make an example of verification or sendSignInLinkEmail? Thanks a lot for response.
