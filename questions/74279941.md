# Handling multiple BLE Write Requests in the received order. (Windows 11 BLE API)

Hi I have a C# application which hosts a BLE Server and receives BLE write requests.
PROBLEM:
Multiple write requests are received each containing fragments of a larger data packet which need to be reassembled.
But as the processing of a received packet is being done the app receives another one which it starts processing in another thread.
The problem is when the packets received later are processed earlier and hence the order for reassembly is lost.
NOTE: the individual data packet does not contain any kind of index.
Is there any solution to this?
I tried including index in the individual packets. It'll work but due to some protocol reasons its
not suitable.
