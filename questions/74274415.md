# React Native - how should I debug the position of scroll bar in ScrollView

I'm having an issue that the x axis of the scroll bar is not on the right, as below.

But I'm expecting

I have a ScrollView like below
          
  const handleScroll = (event) => {
    console.log(event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x);
  };
  ...
  return (<ScrollView onScroll={handleScroll}>...</ScrollView>)

and the console.log show 0 when I keep scrolling.
How should I debug this issue?
