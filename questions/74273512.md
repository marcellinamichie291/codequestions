# How to update same field multiple times in mongodb?

I have to update the linkedContacts field multiple times,  delete 1 item and add some new items, so I have written a query:
  await Contact.updateOne(
    { _id: secondContact._id },
    {
      $pull: {
        linkedContacts: { contactId: firstContactId },
      },
      $addToSet: { linkedContacts: linkedContacts },
    },
  )

But I'm receiving this error:
ERROR: Updating the path 'linkedContacts' would create a conflict at 'linkedContacts'

I don't want to split this query into 2 different queries, so is there a way to do it in a single query?
