I have created a program for Java that I need to use in order to write integars to a txt file, and it runs, but it wont output anything to the file. Note, I'm a beginner coder and the solution is likely a simple fix. Also, -1 is used specifically to end the While Loop. Heres a snapshot of the program:
package forLoopProgram;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileWriter;


public class forLoop {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("fileIO.txt");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter numbers to write to file: ");

        int input1 = 0;
        while(input1 != -1) {
            input1 = sc.nextInt();
            fw.write(input1);
        
        }
        
        fw.close();
                
    }
}

Now, I already tried adding in the flush method, but that didn't fix anything either, however I may have placed it in the wrong spot.
