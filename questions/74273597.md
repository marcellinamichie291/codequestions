# Failed to subscribe to notification characteristic in gatt from UWP to Android

In my UWP application, I want to connect to a Bluetooth low energy peripheral device and subscribe to its notification characteristic. this is the application Connect method:
status = await NotifyCharacter.WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync(GattClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorValue.Notify);
he problem is when I try to write to the notification characteristic, the WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync method raise an exception:
The attribute cannot be written. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80650003)
what can i  do? I want to notify for android.
