I just updated my php version from version 7.3 to version 8.1.10, and then I migrated my CI 3 project to htdocs folder in xampp directory. Then I run my ci3 project and I get an error like this:
str_replace(): Passing null to parameter #3 ($subject) of type array|string is deprecated.
Filename: core/Output.php
Line Number: 442
Backtrace
Then I tried to trace the line of code referred to in system/core/Output.php on line 442 and found this line of code
`
$output = str_replace(array('{elapsed_time}', '{memory_usage}'), array($elapsed, $memory), $output);

`
and change it to be like this
`
$output = str_replace(array("[elapsed_time]", "[memory_usage]"), array($elapsed, $memory), $output);

`
I hope it can solve my problem, but it can't solve my problem
please help let me know if anyone knows how to solve this problem
Thank you to all of you
