# Batch workload on Azure Container Apps

I'm trying to use Azure Container Apps to execute a batch workload periodically as I'm able to do using Azure Container Instance and the Start Container Group rest API (also using the --restart-policy Never).
My docker image isn't an API, it's just a script execution without http result or an http route. So configuring an HTTP endpoint in Azure Container Apps indeed start the job, but wait without purpose. Worst, the health detection rerun the job endlessly as nothing answer to the heath check.
I did see something that could be a solution here > https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/background-processing but I would rather avoid to manage a queue and add complexity to my docker business logic.
Is Azure Container Apps a solution for this kind of use case ? Or should I go back to Container Instance ?
Thanks,
