This is my very first question on a journey of many more questions in my schooling.  Would someone please explain my logic of this binary heap.  I understand that the problem takes n elements and puts them in a array and works the array in if n > n / 2 swap.  I think the problem is in my logic with that.  input is "Enter the size of heap: 3" "Enter Integer(x3): 5 3 1" and output is supposed to be 1 5 3 but the output is becoming 1 3 5.
