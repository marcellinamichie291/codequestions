# php file with php code converted to html comments

So I installed and setup apache and php I have a very basic hello world file.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<?php echo 'HELLO';?>
</body>
</html>

I checked online they said to make sure that the file is php and not html. So yeah my file is indeed 'test.php' however when I run it and inspect it this is the html code.
INSPECT
so.. what am I doing wrong? Any help is appreciated
