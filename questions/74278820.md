# Plotting standard error bars with results from post hoc 'emmeans' function in R

I have a dataset containing the proportion of habitat size changes. I have four groups, namely adult female, adult male, subadult female, subadult male.
I'm trying to add standard error bars to my plot using the values generated by the post hoc tukey test (using the emmeans function) but have no idea how to add the standard error bars manually. I've tried online suggestions and guides but I can't find the right code to add them.
This is my current code
modelB <- lm(arc~ size$Age*size$Sex)
modelB.emm <- emmeans(modelB, ~Age*Sex)
plot(modelB.emm, adjust = "mvt", horizontal = FALSE, CIs= TRUE, color= "black", ylab = "Group", xlab ="Estiamted Marginal Mean")

Here are the results for the post hoc test
            adult female   adult male   subadult female   subadult male
emmean        0.306            0.583         0.548          0.323
SE            0.0739           0.0826        0.1168         0.0826 
df            11               11             11            11
lower.CL      0.143            0.401         0.291          0.141
upper.CL      0.469            0.765         0.805          0.505

I need something like this: (I cannot upload images but here is a link)
Example
And I currently have this with confidence intervals and the marginal mean plotted
Current plot
Thank you in advance.
