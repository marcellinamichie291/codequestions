# Use of Tokens on flutter

I´m new in this site and in flutter, I´m trying to get connected to an API,and I have been running into issues with white spaces I´m using uri.https, and im currently using single and double quotes because that's the only way I found I can avoid the "+" from show in the white space ok the TOKEN. whithout that I receive this error.
[ERROR:flutter/runtime/dart_vm_initializer.cc(41)] Unhandled Exception: FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)
Having say it that this is my code:
String _token='"Token 25e94e9fc7d38d6a10aa9328fb07546881602467"';

final Map<String, String> header={
   'Authorization':_token
 };

final response = await http.post(url,headers:header,body: json.encode(androidid));
final Map<String, dynamic> decodedResp = json.decode(response.body.toString());
print(decodedResp);
print(response.statusCode);
print(header);

and after that I get this:
I/flutter (24825): {detail: Las credenciales de autenticaciÃ³n no se proveyeron.}
I/flutter (24825): 401
I/flutter (24825): {Authorization: "Token 25e94e9fc7d38d6a10aa9328fb07546881602467"}
it supose that the API is waiting for something as {Authorization: Token 25e9............
acording to my boss(this is my second week in my first job  as developer and I´m trying to survive xD ) should works well in that way, but I´m not even sure if is possible do the request using the space, I will be really grateful for your help, thanks
