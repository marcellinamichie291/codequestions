# Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in... (using Handlebars in React)

I'm just getting started with Handlebars and whenever I import it into a React app I keep getting the error message:
"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in..."
I've seen a solution to include the following into the package.json file
"browser": {
  "fs": false,
  "path": false,
  "os": false
}

which has worked for some people but not all. In this case I'm one of the where it didn't fix the issue.
Any suggestions on how to fix it?
