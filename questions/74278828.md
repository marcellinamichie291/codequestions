# How to audit a single attribute modification of a JPA entity?

I have a jpa entity with many attributes and I would like to trigger a specific event when only one of its attribute change.
Example,
@Entity
public class Employee {
   
  private long id;
  private String code
  @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
  private Status status;

  public enum Status {
    NEW, WORKING, SUSPENDED, FIRED;
  }
}

How I can detect if the status of my entity has been changed to FIRED?
I was thinking about using JPA lifecycle events but by just adding a method with the @PreUpdate annotation I would not be able to infer if that single attribute was changed and what value had had before.
Any suggestion?
