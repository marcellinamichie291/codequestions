I have multiple Linux servers with the docker service running on them, after I joined them to an active directory environment(using realmd and sssd), they cannot read their host's /etc/hosts file anymore, which was working before this.
I know there's a flag to add static records to containers (--add-host flag) but I rather troubleshoot this problem and do it dynamically.
Any ideas?
