# Get value from List based on match condition

I have a list : var abc = {"Apple", "Orange"};
I also have a string : var def = "{[Mountain, Mountain, Apple ]}";
I am able to check if the value is true or false with the below code
bool ghi = abc.Any(s => def.Contains(s));

How do I get the position or index in abc though ?
