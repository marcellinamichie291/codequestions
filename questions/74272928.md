# Changing hyperlink text using django urlize template tag

In order to make the text inside static pages dynamic, I created a model with a key and a value method that can be populated from admin panel. Then I filter the data using their keys and show them in appropriate places in the template. Now the goal is to include a hyperlink inside this Textarea field.
I did some digging and came across django urlize template tag, which works fine (docs here), but it sets link text to the actual link. for example if you include https://google.com inside your text, the rendered text in your template would look like this: https://google.com; but I'd like to change this text to something like click here. How can I change this text and set it dynamically from inside the text in admin panel?
