# Unsuccesful conversion of integer into Timestamp

I want to apply a filter of redundant signals in my algorithm where 'to_keep' will be a container for masking of signals, setting first value to 'True'.
'last_kept_date' will be temporary variable holding the last signal date to include in final list.
All data are pandas dataframe with date as indices (typical financial data)
signals = data.loc[(data['cc50'] == 0) & (data['cc50'].shift(1) >= 5)]

signals.loc[:, 'to_keep'] = False
signals.loc[0, 'to_keep'] = True

last_kept_date =  signals.index[0]

for i in signals.index:
    if (i - last_kept_date).days > 365 * 15 /12:
        last_kept_date = i
        signals.loc[i, 'to_keep'] = True
        continue

running the code raises error:
unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'Timestamp'

hence I tried to convert to datestamp so that the same type of data will be substracted by changing:
last_kept_date =  signals.index[0]
into:
last_kept_date =  pd.to_datestamp(signals.index[0])
but still:
module 'pandas' has no attribute 'to_datestamp'

What else can I do so that I will be able to subtract these time indices?
