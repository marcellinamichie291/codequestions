# Updating meeting recipient calendar through service account

Can my app update google calendar recipient meeting, if the recipient has given access to the service account of the App? When I try to do that, I get this message:
Exception thrown: 403 Forbidden
POST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/nisargtest10@gmail.com/events
{
  "code": 403,
  "errors": [
    {
      "domain": "calendar",
      "message": "You need to have writer access to this calendar.",
      "reason": "requiredAccessLevel"
    }
  ],
  "message": "You need to have writer access to this calendar."
}

I need to have the recipient's calendar provide 'Make changes to events' rights to my google cloud console's email under which the web app is registered and only then my app is able to create meeting with that recipient.
There is an issue with this approach - which is, if recipient provides such an access to the username under which the app is registered, that username can now see all events of recipient's calendar. This may not what recipient wants.
This makes me wonder, why not let the owner of the web app's service account schedule meetings with recipients, with such access to that service account and since service account cannot login, there is no such drawback - like described above?
Thanks.
