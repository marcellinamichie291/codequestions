# View live updates on SQLIte Database (Android)

I am working on an SQLIte database collecting various information on my Android App users.
As long as I create the database in the app itself, data input works fine and I can also display the contents of the database without a problem.
I am now looking for a way to connect live to this database from an external browser (e.g. DB Browser), i.e. without having to download the most current version of the db via device file explorer.
Any help is appreciated!
