My goal is to understand how scikit-learn can calculate the intercept and the coefficient.
Let's say, we have the equation y = 1 + 2x. Then I output it to (x,y) -> (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), and so on
Let's say, now, I lost that equation. How to scikit-learn predict the equation?
As far as I know, we can't find the intercept and the coefficient manually y = B0 + B1X. B0 and B1 are unknown. But apparently, scikit-learn can tell me the intercept and the coefficient just by calling `model.
The code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), so on
a = LinearRegression()
a.fit([[0],
       [1],
       [2]], [[1],
              [3],
              [5]])
a.intercept_, a.coef_
