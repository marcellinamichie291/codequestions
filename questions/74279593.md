# Since Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Abstractions is not compatible with .NET 7.0 how can I host my WebApplication on https?

I recently updated my projects to .NET 7.0 and found out that Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Abstractions is not compatible with the newest .NET 7.0.
How can I now host my app on .NET 7.0 on HTTPS?
