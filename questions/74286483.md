# Memory release after ssh copy

I want to copy some files from a Gateway but I'm having problems with windows memory.
I've tried this code
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.WarningPolicy())
ssh.connect(IP, username=USER_GW, password=PSW_GW,look_for_keys=False, banner_timeout=200)
scp = SCPClient(ssh.get_transport())
scp.get(host_folder+'gwlog_0_debug', local_folder)
scp.get(host_folder+'gwlog_0_notice', local_folder)
scp.close()  
del(scp)

but the final result is that during the copy ("Salvataggio dei log...") it increase the memory usage but when it ends the memory usage is never released

this is a problem because after a couple of execution Python blocks windows.
