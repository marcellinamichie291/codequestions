# Rounding converting from string to double/float

I am trying to extract a number from a string and convert it into a double or float so I can do some numerical operations on it. I am able to isolate the variable I need so the string consists only of the number, but when I try to convert it to a float or double it rounds the value, ie from 160430.6 to 160431.
//Helper Function to Extract Value of Interest
//Based on column of final digit of numbers being same across various FLOPS output files
double findValue(string &line, int &refN){
    setprecision(100);
    string output;
    
    //go to end column and work backwards to get value string
    while(line[refN] != ' '){
        output = line[refN] + output;
        refN = refN - 1;    

    }
    
    const char* outputx = output.c_str();
    double out = atof(outputx);
    //removing the const char* line and replacing atof with stod(output) runs into the same issue
    
    return out;
}

int main()
{
    string name;
    cin >> name;
    ifstream file(name);
    //opens file
    if(!file.is_open()){"error while opening the file";
    
    }else{
        //Temporary Reference Definitions
        string ref = "TOGW";
        int refN = 25;
        string line = findLine(file,ref);
        
        double MTOGW = findValue(line, refN);
        cout << MTOGW;
    }
    return 0;
}

I initially tried using stof() to convert, but that rounded. I have also tried using stod() and stold(), and last tried converting to a const char* and using atof(). I have messed with the setprecision() value, but also have not been able to solve it that way.
I cannot use Boost
