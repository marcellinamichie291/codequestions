# Ts and tsx files are not getting analysed by Sonarqube via Github actions for master branch analysis

My setup

Sonarqube CE 8.9 LTS
Typescript version used in project is 4.8
Sonar scanner run via this Github action: GitHub - SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action

What am I trying to achieve?
I’m trying to run sonarqube scanner on PR and master branch for a web app written in typescript and javascript.
What problem am I facing?
ts and tsx files are getting analysed for PR (branch) analysis but when the analysis is run on master branch the ts and tsx files are shown as un-analysed.
code from a PR

code from master branch analysis

What have I tried so far to achieve this
Sample action for master branch analysis:
sonarqube:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: SonarQube Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v1.1.0
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: XX
          SONAR_HOST_URL: XX
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.verbose=true
            -Dsonar.sources=./src/
            -Dsonar.tests=./test/
            -Dsonar.projectKey=my_key
            -Dsonar.eslint.reportPaths=./reports/eslint.json
            -Dsonar.css.stylelint.reportPaths=/reports/stylelint.json
            -Dsonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=./reports/lcov.info

We have also ensured that tsconfig.json has the necessary includes
 "include": [
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    "**/*.css",
  ],

Don’t know what’s going wrong.
