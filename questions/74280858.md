# How do I use Legacy OpenGL calls with QT6?

I'm new to Qt and am trying to import some older C++ openGL code. I'm currently using Qt 6.4. I've subclassed my OpenGL-using class to QOpenGlFunctions.
Many of the glFoo calls "work" but the class also uses calls like glEnableClientState, glVertexPointer, glNormalPointer, glTexCoordPointer, glDisableClientState, glColor4fv, & glMaterialfv which come up with errors like undefined reference to __imp_glTextCoordPointer. Looking at the documentation these appear to no long be supported by "default" but it looks like they are supported using older versions of QOpenGlFunctions such as QOpenGlFunction_1_4 (https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qopenglfunctions-1-4.html).
Trying to change my subclass from QOpenGLFunctions to QOpenGLFunctions_1_4 complains that really only QOpenGLFunctions_1_4_CoreBackend and QOpenGLFunctions_1_4_DeprecatedBackend exist but there appears to be no documentation on those and if I subclass to one of them I start seeing complaints about my constructor...
How do I actually access the functions from these older versions of the class?
