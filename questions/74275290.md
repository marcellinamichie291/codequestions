# How to make a redirection and then refresh the target page?

I have an issue when I use the CRUD in PHP.
I created a delete page, and when the code is over, I put the redirection to another page.
To do so, I need to refresh manually the target page, to see the result.
For now, i'm using this code:
header("Location: www.mysite.com/page5.php");

I'm looking for a way to make the redirection and to refresh the target page once.
Thanks in advance 😁👍.
Bye.
