# Why won't NGINX let go of a port?

We have an NGINX and Gunicorn setup that has worked for years, but things have gone flaky all of a sudden on one of our Linux servers.
We have a number of Flask services that are run via Gunicorn. We also have an NGINX upstream defined for Gunicorn, which is running on port 8087.
Whenever we try to hit one of our Flask services after Gunicorn starts/restarts, the HTTP request just hangs for a couple of hours before the issue magically resolves itself.
The output from netstat -anp | grep 8087 includes the following connections:
tcp    2    0    0.0.0.0:8087      0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN       13175/python
tcp    0    0    127.0.0.1:54726   127.0.0.1:8087    ESTABLISHED  12978/nginx

If we stop NGINX altogether, the NGINX connection above goes away and we're able to make a speedy request to our Flask service.
Alternatively, if instead of stopping NGINX altogether, we run ps -ef | grep nginx and then kill the process that reads "nginx: worker process", NGINX re-spawns the worker process and we're then able to make a request to our Flask service.
