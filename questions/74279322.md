# CASE WHEN 2 conditions Questions

I have 2 tables.

1st Table: Dates (i.e 22-10,2017)
2nd Table: mm-dd (col 1) and Y/N flag (col 2).

I want to write something like this:
CASE 
    WHEN (FORMAT_DATETIME('%m-%d', a.Date) = monthDate.monthDate 
          AND monthDate.currentWeekFlag = "Y" 
        THEN "Y" 
        ELSE "N" 
END AS WFC

But I get an error:

Syntax error: Parenthesized expression cannot be parsed as an expression, struct constructor, or subquery

How can I fix this?
I tried an IF statement, CASE statement but can't figure it out.
