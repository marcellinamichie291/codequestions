# DMARC: SPF Records, Include IP

Let say, I have a web server with public IP 888.88.88.888, the domain name is www.test.com
This server able to send email by using local SMTP Server located at 192.168.0.88
The sender mail will be webmaster@test.com
It was done
But I got problem with DMARC things
After checking, I know I need to set DKIM and SPF for my DNS
What I don't know is how to set include parameter from SPF ?
It can includes domain and ip, so what I don't understand is, in my case, the one which really sent the email is local ip 192.168.0.88 as SMTP server
So, while for include in spf param, I put "v=spf1 include:test.com -all"
will this be correct? I'm not sure because it said SPF only approved if the mail sent from the DNS IP, while in my case, it is the SMTP server which send the email and have different IP from DNS
Also what does this include in spf means ?
v=spf1 include:%{ir}.%{v}.%{d}.spf.has.pphosted.com ~all
I tried with different parameters, but nothing is working. I wonder what is the appropriate way.
I expect a little explanation about the correct way to do what I need to do.
