# site cache showing other site

I have faced a problem which I can't understand whether it is from my end or the web site has been hacked or attacked. Let me explain my scenario.
Suppose I have a website www.abc.com when I open it on browser it is working fine.
when I use cache:www.abc.com the google caches shows that image of www.xyz.com is taken on (dd-mm-yyyy) date.
When I go to www.xyz.com it is exactly the copy of my script with the change of design (HTML).
How is this possible?
Is my website hacked? Can anyone tell me what exactly is wrong with it.
Help will be greatly appreciated.
plesase let me know how to fix this
