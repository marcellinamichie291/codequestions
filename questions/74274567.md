#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 
using namespace std;
//Global declarations: Constants and type definitions only -- no variables
//Function prototypes 
int main()
{
//In cout statement below SUBSTITUTE  your name and lab number
cout << "Noah Duran -- Lab Number 1" << endl << endl;

//Setting n to be 18 and r to be 3, for we are finding teams of 3 from total 18
double people(18.0);
double groups(3.0);

//Dividing n by (n-r), in this case people by (people - groups)
double findPermutations(double people, double groups) ;{
    return double(people) / double(people - groups);
}

//Dividing n by r*(n-r) to find combinations
double findCombinations(double people, double groups) ;{
    return double(people) / double(people - groups) * double(groups);
}

//Outputting total number of permutations and number of combinations
cout << "Total number of permutations: " << &findPermutations << endl;
cout << "Total number of combinations: " << &findCombinations << endl;

// -Comment this out for using MacOS- system("pause");
return 0;

Whenever I run this through the debugger there are no errors or warnings but when I compile it through terminal it only outputs my name and lab number, nothing else. I cannot find out why it is not outputting my other cout statements. I also tried to print the value of people and groups before the sections that divide n by (n-r) and it will display then, just not after.
