# Custom fixed bar width in Plotly Express, Python 3

I am trying to deal with axis labels overlapping by having the axis width dynamical in my horizontal bar plot:
fig = px.bar(df, orientation='h')   

fig.update_layout(
     yaxis_nticks = len(df.columns),
     height = len(df.columns)*30,
     ).update_xaxes(automargin = True,
     ).update_yaxes(automargin = True)

For some reason it works fine just with some df shape, when the shape is smaller, yaxis labels overlap again.
Having dynamical size of the yaxis does not work for me then. Is there a way how to have the bars width fixed in Plotly Express? I found it just for Plotly GO which I do not want to use.
Thanks.
