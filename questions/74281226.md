# Python Watchdog scanning folder twice

I am trying to make a program that scans a folder and extracts the text from the pdf files in that folder.Â 
But when I put a pdf in the folder, it prints out the text twice.
from os import scandir
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
import logging
import time
import pdfplumber

source_dir = r'C:\Users\rober\Desktop\Python\LMT\LMT_PDF'
dest_dir = r'C:\Users\rober\Desktop\Python\LMT\LMT_DEST'

document_extensions = [".pdf"]


class PdfMaker(FileSystemEventHandler):

    def on_modified(self, event):
        with scandir(source_dir) as entries:
            for entry in entries:
                name = entry.name
                self.extract_text(name)

    def extract_text(self, name):
        if name.endswith("pdf"):
            with pdfplumber.open(f'{source_dir}\\{name}') as pdf:
                for page in pdf.pages:
                    texts = page.extract_text()
                    print(texts)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s',
                        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    path = source_dir
    event_handler = PdfMaker()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=True)
    observer.start()
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(10)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        observer.stop()
    observer.join()


I have tried to debug it to see where it's running twice, but it didn't tell me anything.
