# Persist data between chat using google chat chatbot

I am looking to build a chat bot using google appscipt or using the REST-API with Google Chat API.
Is there a way to persist or create a flow using the previous message.
Eg. say I make a slash command : /student 1234 -> which will give me a basic info of the student(external REST API call) and a button which will be additional info, which will give additional information about the student (external REST API call), but using argument "1234" which was sent previously in the slash command.
