I am trying to build an Alexa skill. I need one of the intent to multiply a slot value with a constant and store the product under some variable. I want the Alexa to speak the output this variable in her output sentence.
I have tried this but no luck:
int a
slots= handler_input.request_envelope.request.slots
num= slots["numbers"].value
name= slots["names"].value

if name=="xyz":
    a=num*20
    speak.output=("the total is %d" %a)
