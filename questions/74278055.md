# Direct print to Alfrseco Document Storage : Store, Sign and Print

I need some information and guidance on setup and configuring Alfresco ; my goal is to print directly to Alfresco with a PDF printer to output directly or a raw file. I need that to be consumed by Alfresco - stored and a listing - each one to be signed digitally and then after signature a print out to a physical printer.
