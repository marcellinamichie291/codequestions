# Why does graphQL need an endpoint? Can the app be not have everything in itself?

I'm creating an app in react-native and GraphQL.
And following is the code In using for connection to graphql:
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: MySessionAwareGraphQLSchema,
  graphiql: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
}));

Can we not have everything in the app itself? Why do we need a server/endpoint?
