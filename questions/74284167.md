# extract all colors in an scss files and put it inside varilables

I have a situation that i have 150 files that doesn't contain scss variables, and there are dublications of colors inside the files, i want to extract all of them into one single file, without the opening each and search for the colors then change it to a new named variable, this is totally a time waste for me and v. hard to keep doing it for 150 file.
also there are multiple css properties that has the colors ( background, background-color, box-shadow, color, border ).
is there some sort of task runner that can be build to extract all these fast, and create a variable for each???
i have tried to use some sites that converts scss to css then css to scss and it goes fine for ( background-color, color ) attributes, but there still ( background, border, box-shadow ) which doesn't work with these sites/platforms
