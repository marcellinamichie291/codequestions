# CTR-Mode sender only sends IV once. How do i communicate with Alice?

I (Bob) am trying to communicate with Alice using CTR mode to decrypt her messages and equivalently encrypt mines and send them to her. The problem is when Alice first contacts me she sends her encrypted message and the IV, but the second time she contacts me she sends no IV.
How do i decrypt her second message?
I am using petlib in CTR mode
aes = Cipher("AES-128-CTR")

and these are my encrypt decrypt functions
    def decrypt(msg, key):
        iv = msg[1]
        dec = aes.dec(key, iv)
        pt0 = dec.update(msg[0])
        pt0 += dec.finalize()
        return pt0

    def encrypt(msg, key):
        iv = urandom(16)
        enc = aes.enc(key, iv)
        ct1 = enc.update(bytes(msg,'UTF-8'))
        ct1 += enc.finalize()
        return ct1,iv
