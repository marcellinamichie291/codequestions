# converting yfinance data into a proper time series

stock_info = yf.download(tickers = 'aapl', period ="5y",interval="1d", auto_adjust = True)
stock_info = stock_info.asfreq("b")
stock_info = stock_info.fillna(method='ffill')
stock_info = stock_info.iloc[1:]

results = seasonal_decompose(stock_info_new, model = "multiplicative")

above is my code attempting to convert yfinance data into a time series and then trying using the stats model to analyze the data before I choose a model. I keep receiving this error seen below.
    157         period = pfreq
    158     else:
--> 159         raise ValueError(
    160             "You must specify a period or x must be a pandas object with "
    161             "a PeriodIndex or a DatetimeIndex with a freq not set to None"
    162         )
    163 if x.shape[0] < 2 * pfreq:
    164     raise ValueError(
    165         f"x must have 2 complete cycles requires {2 * pfreq} "
    166         f"observations. x only has {x.shape[0]} observation(s)"
    167     )

ValueError: You must specify a period or x must be a pandas object with a PeriodIndex or a DatetimeIndex with a freq not set to None

how can I fix this error?
