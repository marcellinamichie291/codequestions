# App Center Capabilities Not Supported with fastlane

I have a build/test/deploy process for a React Native app that's supported by App Center but I need to move my repo into GitLa. Per the "Connecting to Self-Hosted GitLab Instances" section in the App Center docs, "The instance must be reachable over the internet". Unfortunately, our repo cannot be reachable over public internet, so I've been looking into replacements for App Center. I came across fastlane and noticed that it does pretty much everything App Center does (and App Center actually just uses fastlane under the hood.) So I have a few questions:

What purpose does App Center fufill over that of what tools like fastlane can do? I imagine App Center just simplies it a bit by pulling the utility functions of fastlane together into more of a user product. Is that correct?
Is there any way to accomplish the capabilities of App Center's CodePush (release small features/bug fixes without requiring rebuilding the binary and redistributing it again through the app stores) through some other tool?
In addition to fastlane, I've also seen recommendations for Bitrise, CircleCI, and Expo EAS. Do any of these tools fufill the needs covered by App Center?

Sorry, I know that's a lot all at once. Very much appreciate the help!!
