# Error: transaction: reverted with reason string 'ERC721: approval to current owner'

I want to transfer nft from one account to another. I have an issuer contract with the following functions:
  function safeMint(address contractAddress, uint256 tokenId) public payable  {
        require(msg.value >= 0, "Not enough ETH to purchase NFT; check price!"); 
        _safeMint((address(this)), tokenId);
        approve(contractAddress, tokenId);


    }
function transferToken(address contractAddress, address to, uint256 tokenId)public{
   // require(_isApprovedOrOwner( from, tokenId));
   transferFrom( contractAddress,  to, tokenId);
}

I am calling these functions from a main contract:
 Issuer issuer= new Issuer();
 Manager m1= new Manager(emp1);

 issuer.safeMint(issuer.getContractAddress(), 1);
 issuer.safeMint(issuer.getContractAddress(), 2);
 issuer.transferToken(issuer.getContractAddress(), m1.getContractAddress(), 1);

I am getting the following error: "reason string 'ERC721: approval to current owner''".
I want to transfer the token from issuer.getContractAddress() to m1.getContractAddress().
As far as I understand I am minting the token to the base issuer contract, then approving the incoming issuer contract object to be able to transfer the token,then transferring the token from this issuer contract object to manager account. But this dosen't seem to work.
