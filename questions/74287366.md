# How does Intel DSA (Data Streaming Accelerators) can store the descriptors in the local sram?

I would like to ask a question regarding to Intel DSA (Data Streaming Accelerator).
According to the documentation, Intel DSA can support up to 256 queues and 65536 entries(the bit width of registers are 8 and 16 respectively). Are all descriptors stored locally in the sram, or is the hardware written to the DDR?
I think such a large number of descriptors and queues will take up a lot of chip area, and the hardware circuit timing and congestion is difficult to control.
