# How to store and load a big variable in python?

My question is related with the storage and the loading of a big variable in python. Specifically, among other variables (v1, v2), I want to store a list of nested lists (v3)(bool type).
v3 = [[[False] for x in range(6000)] for x in range(6000)]

Then, I perform some operation so I change some of the False values into True.
I have tried to used pickle for saving with the argument protocol=4 since the total memory of my variables (v1, v2, v3) exceeds the 4GiB:
filename = 'path.pkl'
with open(filename,'wb') as f:
      pickle.dump([v1, v2, v3],f, protocol=4) 

I have used the pickle.load command to import my data.
    with open('path.pkl','rb') as f:
        (v1,v2,v3) = pickle.load(f)

but I got an error: AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'FrozenNDArray' on <module 'pandas.core.indexes.frozen' from 'C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\indexes\\frozen.py'>
Then, I tried the pd.read_pickle and I was able to load my data.
The problem with pickle is that my variable v3 is no longer a boolean one. The variable stores the number of indexes whose value is True. I have confirmed that since I printed the a specific list before and after the saving. Before the saving the list was a boolean one, and after it stores indexes.
Do you have a suggestion/alternative for a more efficient method so I can efficiently store and load my big variables?
