# How to access parent props from child component - react

Let's say that I want to build a reusable react Accordion Component, which will have an AccordionSummary and an AccordionDetails child like this:`
<Accordion>
 <AccordionTitle>This is an accordion title</AccordionTitle>
 <AccordionSummary>This is the accordion summary, which will be shown if the user clicks the accordion title </AccordionSummary>
</Accordion>

How can I make it, so that when the AccordionTitle is clicked, the summary will be shown to the corresponding accordion. Is there a way to share data between react child and parent components for each individual accordion in this case.
