# DateAdd Function on Monthly Basis Looses End-of-Month Information (Microsoft Access)

Let me preface by saying I'm mostly new to VBA and coding in general. My company runs an Access database to keep track of our ~500 storage customers and lots. Each lot has a date paid, date due, and expiry date associated with it that is updated monthly (usually).
We used to just use the Date Picker to select each date manually after pulling up the lot. However, I've created a button that runs the following command:
Private Sub Extend_One_Month_Click()
Me.[Date Paid Actual] = Date
Me.[Date_Paid] = DateAdd("m", 1, [Date_Paid])
Me.[Date_Paid_Expiry] = DateAdd("m", 1, [Date_Paid_Expiry])
Me.Recalc
End Sub

This works great, for the most part. My issue is that it does not keep any end-of-month information. So, if a customers usual due date is the 29th (or greater) of each month, and I use this function in February, their due date becomes the 28th of each month moving forward (on Access, anyway). Is there any function that will preserve this information?
Thank you!
