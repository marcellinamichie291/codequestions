# Is this metadata valid? The "Elements" section in the developer tab does not match the source code

I am trying to set the metadata of my webpage with plain JavaScript.
I want to be sure that search engines pick up on the published meta data.
The source code does not match what is shown in the developer tab.
Which one of these is representative of what search engines are reading?
<html>
<meta name="description" content="" />
<script>
document
    .getElementsByTagName('meta')
    .namedItem('description')
    .setAttribute('content','My Meta Description Here')

console.log('Meta Description Set')
</script>
</html>
