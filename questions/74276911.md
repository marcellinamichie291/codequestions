# github actions - check run, can i trigger a job with multiple conditions?

Can I use check_run trigger in Github Actions the following way?
  on:
     check_run:
       types: [completed]
       conclusion: [success]
       name: [mytest]

Is there anyone who can give me a correct example to follow?
