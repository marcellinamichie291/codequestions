# Netpune: drop large number of vertices getting timeout error

I'm using the following query to drop around 100K vertices inside Neptune.
g.V().hasLabel('my-label').drop().iterate()

But getting the following error
  "errorMessage": "500: {\"code\":\"TimeLimitExceededException\",\"detailedMessage\":\"A timeout occurred within the script during evaluation.\"}",
  "errorType": "GremlinServerError",

We can't change the neptune_query_timeout at the moment, is there any way I can delete by doing something using limit, count, or range inside the query?
