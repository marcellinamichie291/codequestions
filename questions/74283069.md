# Spring Boot Liquibase doesn't appear to support XML formatted changelog

spring-boot-starter-parent:2.7.5
I have configured the following in my src/main/resources/application.yml file:
spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml

---

spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: prod
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
    url: ${DB_URL}
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}

Additionally, the following resource exists in the project repository:
src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml

I also have the following configured in src/test/resources/application.yml:
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: test
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
    username: sa
    password: sa
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml

When I try to build this project the build fails with the following error message:

Liquibase failed to start because no changelog could be found at 'classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml'

Is there some way to configure spring boot to allow an xml based liquibase changelog file? If so, what am I missing? Or does it only support the yaml format?
