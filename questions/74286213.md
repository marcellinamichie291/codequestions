# Spliting dataset to train and test in python

I have dataset whose Label is 0 or 1.
I want to divide my data into test and train sets.For this, I used the
train_test_split method from sklearn at first,
But I want to select the test data in such a way that 10% of them are from class 0 and 90% are from class 1.
How can I do this?
