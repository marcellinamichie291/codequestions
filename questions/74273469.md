# How to create Excel file from Excel template file using MS Graph API?

I would like to create regular Excel files (.xlsx, .xlsm) from an Excel template file (.xltm) via the MS Graph API.
I didn't find anything in the docs (only to convert into PDF).
I tried to copy the file and changed the extension of the target file, but this results in a corrupted file.
Has anyone done this before?
