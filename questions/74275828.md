I want this code to give me "Norwegian lives in the yellow house 1, drinks water, smokes Kools and has a fox"
but I can't seem to sort things accordingly. So it gives me the answers I want but very ugly. [(('Drinks', {'coffee': 5, 'tea': 2, 'milk': 3, 'WATER': 1, 'oj': 4}), ('Nations', {'Englishman': 3, 'Spaniard': 4, 'Ukranian': 2, 'Japanese': 5, 'Norwegian': 1}), ('Colours', {'red': 3, 'green': 5, 'ivory': 4, 'yellow': 1, 'blue': 2}), ('Pets', {'dog': 4, 'snails': 3, 'fox': 1, 'horse': 2, 'ZEBRA': 5}), ('Smokes', {'OldGold': 3, 'Kools': 1, 'Chesterfields': 2, 'LuckyStrike': 4, 'Parliaments': 5}))]
How can I sort this according to houses?
Sorry I'm struggling quite a lot as an electrical engineering student taking a computer engineering class...thank you for the help :)
