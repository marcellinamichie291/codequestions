# How can I detect a new incoming call during an active phone call programmatically in Android

I'm building an Android Dialer App and currently I'm working on a calling feature. The problem that I'm facing right now is when I'm already on a phone call and someone calls me, my app doesn't detect that there is another incoming call.
I want to show user new incoming call on the calling screen during an active phone call.
How can I detect that and show it to the user? Thanks!
