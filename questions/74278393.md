# Product co-purchasing or bundles given a product ID

I have a data(amazon co-purchasing product) in two columns with values as product ID. I would like to select values from 100 - 299, 300-399, 400-999 and others values and group them. I want to create a bundle or co-purchasing between product in one group with another eg. 100-299 and 300-399, 400-999 and 100-299. The original data has two columns with FromNode and ToNode. Below are few lines of the original data. Some values(product ID) appear under both columns.
    FromNode ToNode 
    0   1
    0   2
    0   3
    0   4
    0   5
    1   0
    1   2
    1   4
    1   5
    1   15
    2   0
    2   11      
    2   13
    2   14
    3   63
    3   64
    3   65
    3   66
    3   67




I am using df[df[['FromNode', 'ToNode']].isin([100,101,102...299]).any(1)] to pick the values in the range but it seems I have to list all the values in the isin argument. Is there an efficient way to just give the range 100-299 to the isin(100-299) to fetch the values. Should just combine both columns into one and use iloc to select the values. Any tips will help.
