# Loop to test range of variables and find the best ones in Pyhton

First of all thank you for this amazing space to learn from you all, I have the following question. I created a code that imports data from several APIs and it performs various statistical operations around the data. And it returns 1 result number, which is helpful to see if the model is correct.
The code is built around 4 (or more), static variables. What I want is to create a range of number for each of those variables and test all possible combinations in the code, that returns the top 10 highest result numbers.
it looks like this:

#I would want to test i.e. variable_1 in a range from (-0.004 to 0.004 at 0.001 increments), the same for the other variables until I can get the top 10 highest result_number
variable_1 = 0.004
variable_2 = 0.005
variable_3 = 30
result_number = 0

def my_code():
global variable_1, variable_2, variable_3
#perform all the operations utilizing the variables
return result_number



Please let me know if it is clear, or if you have any idea how to attack this.
Thank YOU!!
I am new to Python so I am still trying to figure out how to loop and record the highest numbers as it goes. The code is fairly long so it will take a few hours for the simmulation
