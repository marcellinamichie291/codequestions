# 12 seconds to Copy/paste 6 simple cells. How to speed up the code?

I have a very simple code that takes almost 12 seconds to execute. It used to take under a second but about 2/3 months ago all the simple copy/paste macros takes several seconds.
Not sure if it has to do with the MS versions or another software that are interfering with clipboard.
Other common errors that started occurring around the same time was:

Excel could not copy the content to the clipboard it is in use by another application
Not Enough Memory

This code takes about 12 seconds to execute:
Sub RunTime_Seconds()


Dim StartTime As Double
Dim SecondsElapsed As Double
StartTime = Timer

lzCalc = Application.Calculation

With Application
 .Calculation = xlCalculationManual
 .ScreenUpdating = False
 .DisplayAlerts = False

ActiveSheet.Range("A1").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B1").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

ActiveSheet.Range("A2").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B2").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

ActiveSheet.Range("A3").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B3").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

ActiveSheet.Range("A4").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B4").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

ActiveSheet.Range("A5").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B5").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

ActiveSheet.Range("A6").copy
ActiveSheet.Range("B6").PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

 .Calculation = lCalc
 .ScreenUpdating = True
 .DisplayAlerts = True
End With

  SecondsElapsed = Round(Timer - StartTime, 2)

  MsgBox "This code ran successfully in " & SecondsElapsed & " seconds", vbInformation

End Sub

Please Help
I have researched online but unable to find users with similar problems. Usually the "slow" process are due to complicated codes.
