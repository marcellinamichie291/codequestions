# Postman API testing: Assertion of value datatype within POST response not validating correctly

I am trying to assert value datatypes against a POST response but I am getting a success response for incorrect datatypes, i.e. my assertion for a number is a success when the value is a string.
This is the response to the POST:
  [
    {
        "customerActivity": [
            {
                "CustomerActivity": {
                    "Client": {
                        "clientCode": "TEST001",
                        "creditGroup": null
                    },
                    "Cash": 4321,
                    "status": "SUCCESS",
                    "statusDetails": ""
                }
            },
            {
                "CustomerActivity": {
                    "Client": {
                        "clientCode": "TEST002",
                        "creditGroup": null
                    },
                    "Cash": 1234,
                    "status": "SUCCESS",
                    "statusDetails": ""
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]

This is my test to check that the value for clientCode is a number, which results in a Success even though the value is a string (it should be a string, I want the test to fail):
  let jsonData = pm.response.json()
  
  pm.test("clientCode is a number", () => {
      _.each(jsonData.customerActivity, (item) => {
          pm.expect(item.clientCode).to.be.an("number");
      })
  })

I have tried various ways to get to clientCode and I either get the same Success or "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined".
I am a noob so I'm sure it's dead simple but I really would appreciate some help.
