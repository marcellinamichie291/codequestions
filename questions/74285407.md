# Spring Framework WebClient not sending request when using Apache HttpComponents

I'm building an application that need to call an endpoint using NTLM authentication. My approach is that I try to use the Apache HttpComponents for the NTLM authentication and integrate the Spring WebClient with it. However, the WebClient doesn't seem to send any request at all. There's no errors but the response won't be returned.
Below is my code:
BasicCredentialsProvider credsProvider = new BasicCredentialsProvider();
credsProvider.setCredentials(new AuthScope(null, -1), new NTCredentials(username, password, computername, domain));
HttpAsyncClientBuilder clientBuilder = HttpAsyncClients.custom();
clientBuilder.setDefaultRequestConfig(RequestConfig.DEFAULT);
ClientHttpConnector connector = new HttpComponentsClientHttpConnector(client);

WebClient.builder().clientConnector(connector).build();

ResponseDto response = webClient.post()
                .uri("http://myhost:8080/api/notification/add")
                .body(Mono.just(request), RequestDto.class)
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(ResponseDto.class).block();
