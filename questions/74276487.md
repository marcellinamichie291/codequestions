# Select variables with multiple character vectors in data.table

I know we can select columns with a character vector in data.table with "..":
col = c("X1", "X2", "X3")
dt[, ..col]

However, it only works when we only use one character vector to select variables. What if I have multiple character vectors and wish to use all of them to select variables from data.table? Can I do it without merging the two vectors?
IV = c("X1", "X2", "X3")
DV = c("Y1", "Y2", "Y3")

dt[, ..(IV+DV)] gives an error "function .. doesn't exist"
