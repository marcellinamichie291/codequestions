# Trying to output the length of a string using strlen() through a pointer

I am trying to output the length of a string using strlen(). But I want to do it through a pointer.
Here's what I tried:
`
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char a[]="wel";
    int *p;
    p=&a;
    printf("%d\n",strlen(*p));
}

The image shows the error I am getting while compiling:
Then made this change in the code declaration of *p to *p[]:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char a[]="wel";
    int *p[];
    p=&a;
    printf("%d\n",strlen(*p));
}

But then I am getting an error "storage size of 'p' isn't known."
What am I still missing?
