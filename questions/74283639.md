# Is it possible to modify .docx files through client-side JavaScript?

Im trying to add/remove lines to an existing .docx file through the browser. I've found docx.js that's able to create .docx files from scratch but isn't able to modify already existing ones. Haven't been able to find a solution yet, is one there?
I've surfed Google and GitHub without any results for a client-side processing of this
