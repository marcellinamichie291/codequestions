# Saving additional field from dropdown

I m having list of relations, when I select Other,new fields shows #AddOther, and when I enter "Test" into new field, in database i get stored Other, because it takes from the f.select. What should i do to save into database from new field when i chosse Other from the list.
= f.select(:relationship, ['Father', 'Mother', "Sibling", "Children", "Friend", "Spouse", "Other"], {}, { :class => 'form-select  RelationshipSelect'  })
        fieldset class="form-group" style="display:none"
        input#AddOther.mt-4.form-control[type="text" style="display:none" placeholder="Enter other relationship"]

$('.RelationshipSelect').change(function() {
    var v;
    v = $(this).val();
    if (v == 'Other') {
        $('#AddOther').slideDown();
    } else {
        $('#AddOther').slideUp();
    }
});

I tried to add #AddOther to f.select but no progress.
Cant figure it out how to save AddOther into list to be able to save it as "Father", "Mother"....
