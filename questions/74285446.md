# Reading MultiGeometry KML file using Geopandas

I have a kml file with multigeometry shapefiles (points and polygons). I want to access only the polygon shapefile present inside the kml file.
I tried reading the kml file using Geopandas-
inputfile = 'path to kml file' fiona.supported_drivers['KML'] = 'rw' sp = gpd.read_file(inputfile, driver='KML')
here 'sp' variable only reads the point features present inside the kml file. I tried using 'Geometry' argument along with the driver argument, but still only the point features are read.
Can anyone help me in accessing the 'Polygon' shapefile layer in the kml file?
