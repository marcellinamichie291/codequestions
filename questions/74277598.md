# XMLHttpRequest cannot load XXX No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header

tl;dr; About the Same Origin Policy
I have a Grunt process which initiates an instance of express.js server. This was working absolutely fine up until just now when it started serving a blank page with the following appearing in the error log in the developer's console in Chrome (latest version):

XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://www.example.com/
      No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested 
      resource. Origin 'http://localhost:4300' is therefore not allowed access.

What is stopping me from accessing the page?
