# how to duplicate a pattern?

I wanted to make a program that make a triangle pattern and also make an input that let it duplicate but I'm still new to programming and I didn't find any solution to this.
I wanted to make it like this.
input example:
2 3
then the output looks like:
   *
  **
 ***
   *
  **
 ***  

this is my current code.
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main()  
{  

//the triangle code
    int n,m=1;  
    scanf("%d",&n);  
    for(int i=n;i>=1;i--)  
    {  
        for(int j=1;j<=i-1;j++)  
        {  
          printf(" ");  
        }  
        for(int k=1;k<=m;k++)  
        {  
            printf("*");  
        }  
        printf("\n");  
        m++;  
    }
