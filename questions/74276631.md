# How to solve this error: join() expects at most 2 arguments, 4 given Laravel

I am trying to display some data on a view from the database using 2 tables. Its a details view which shows data for a particular id. But I want to match a column with another column from another table and show data from the other table on the same view.
Here is how I tried it, but I am getting an error join() expects at most 2 arguments, 4 given


function details ($id) {
        $fruit = Fruit::find($id);
                        join('fruit', 'fruit.id', '=', $id);
        $page = "Fruit Details";
        return view('admin.fruits.details', compact('fruit'), ['page'=>$page]);
    }



Please Help
