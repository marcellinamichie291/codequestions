# Outputting variable name and value in a loop

I want to loop over a list of variables nad output the variable name and value. E.g., say I have x=1 and y=2, then I want an output
x is 1
y is 2

I suspect I need to use Symbols for this. Here is my approach, but it isn't working:
function t(x,y)
    for i in [x,y]
        println("$(Symbol(i)) is $(eval(i))") # outputs "1 is 1" and "2 is 2"
    end
end

t(1, 2)

Is there a way to achieve this? I guess a Dictionary would work, but would be interested to see if Symbols can also be used here.
