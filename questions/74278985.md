# Using MapKit causes Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed, this will cause undefined behavior

Using Swift5.7, XCode14.0, iOS16.0,
I get very strange error messages and warnings in my XCode console, when trying to make a MapKit example to work.
Here is the log:
2022-11-01 17:26:51.756834+0100 myApp[3999:834036] Metal API Validation Enabled

It seems that in SwiftUI, there has been a change in how Published variables in combination with Bindings are handeled.
The core issue, I think, is very nicely described here.
And I assume that Apple has not finished the transition to this new SwiftUI4 behaviour in their own API's themselves.
Or is there any way I can make the Publishing changes bla bla warning going away ??
See my entire Code here below:
//
//  MyView.swift
//  myApp
//

import SwiftUI
import MapKit

struct MyView: View {
    
    @State private var showMap = false
    @State private var region = MKCoordinateRegion(
            center: CLLocationCoordinate2D(
                latitude: 37.8879948,
                longitude: 4.1237047
            ),
            span: MKCoordinateSpan(
                latitudeDelta: 0.05,
                longitudeDelta: 0.05
            )
        )
    @State private var locations: [Location] = [Location(name: "Test", description: "", latitude: 37.8879948, longitude: 4.1237047)]
    @State private var isLoading = false
    
    var body: some View {
        
        Map(coordinateRegion: $region,
            annotationItems: locations,
            annotationContent: { location in
                MapAnnotation(
                    coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: location.latitude, longitude: location.longitude)
                ) {
                    VStack {
                        Image("THPin")
                            .resizable()
                            .scaledToFit()
                            .frame(width: 44, height: 44)
                        ZStack {
                            Text(location.name)
                                .padding(5)
                                .font(.subheadline)
                                .background(.white.opacity(0.5), in: Capsule())
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
