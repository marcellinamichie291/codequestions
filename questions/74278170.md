# Pulling dynamic content through a VBA script

I am trying to write a VBA code to work with a power automate flow. The code is going to unprotect a document, lock a range of cells that were unlocked (determined by the power automate flow) and then re-protect the document. So far I have figured out how to write the working code to protect the document, lock all cells (the variable doesn't pull through), and re-protect the document. How do I pull the variable range though to lock only selected rows from the power automate flow?

I have tried moving the variable to various places in the code and trying to identify range on its own it the variable but there have been so many tests I cant remember all the variations.
So far I have been able to unlock all the cells or lock all the cells not the specific range.
