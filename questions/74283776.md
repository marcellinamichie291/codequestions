# local hostname not resolved on ubuntu 20.04

I setup a local Gitea server in my lab and set its hostname as gitea.local. This is what the server gives after run hostnamectl status
$ hostnamectl status
   Static hostname: gitea.local
         Icon name: computer-desktop
           Chassis: desktop
        Machine ID: blablabla
           Boot ID: blablabla
  Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
            Kernel: Linux 5.15.0-52-generic
      Architecture: x86-64

And other outputs.
$ hostname -A
gitea.local
$ hostname -f
gitea.local
$ hostname -i
192.168.0.6

Hostname can be resolved on my raspberrypi

$ ping gitea.local

It is weird that gitea is resolvable.
$ ping gitea

I have already configure libnss-mdns according to this article: How to resolve LAN hostnames with Ubuntu. This is how my /etc/nsswitch.conf looks like.
$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# Example configuration of GNU Name Service Switch functionality.
# If you have the `glibc-doc-reference' and `info' packages installed, try:
# `info libc "Name Service Switch"' for information about this file.

passwd:         files systemd
group:          files systemd
shadow:         files
gshadow:        files

hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4
networks:       files

protocols:      db files
services:       db files
ethers:         db files
rpc:            db files

netgroup:       nis

I can fix this by adding the ip address to /etc/hosts but this would lost the meaning of mDNS.
How can I fix this on my laptop?
