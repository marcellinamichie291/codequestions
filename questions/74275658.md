# What happens to AWS Lambda code, under the hood, when we add serializer?

What happens with .netcore Lambda programm when we add the following serializer attribute (LambdaSerializer) in the beginning of Lambda.cs file?
[assembly: LambdaSerializer(typeof(Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson.DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer))]   

namespace SimpleScheduling.Lambda;

public class Function
{
    var runnerName = "Jim Wilson";
    public void FunctionHandler(EventInfo input,
        ILambdaContext context)
    {
        switch (input.ActionName)
        {
            case "PatreonMail":
                context.Logger.LogInformation($"Received call for {input.ActionName}");
                break;
            case "VipPatreonMail":
                context.Logger.LogInformation($"Received call for {input.ActionName}");
                break;
            default:
                context.Logger.LogInformation($"Unknown action");
                break;
        }
    }
}

Here, it is clear what happens at the top level - JSON input will be converted into .net class. However, I wanted to understand what changes happens with the program execution when this attribute is added? Any specific aws assembly/classes injected as dependency to all classes where input happens? Perhaps, my question is specfic to AWS Lambda, but it is more common question for the other .net core projects.
