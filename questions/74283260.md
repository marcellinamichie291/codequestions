# How do I find nodes that are only a member of one way with Overpass Turbo?

I'm looking for all of the nodes at the end of residential roads that aren't turning circles to see if there are any missing turning circles.
I have this so far:
node({{bbox}});
way(bn)[highway="residential"];
node(w:1,-1)[highway!="turning_circle"]({{bbox}});
out;

It works well except it also finds nodes at the end that join another road, I only need the nodes that are part of a singular way.
