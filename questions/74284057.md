# Monitor YouTube Stream For Lack of Audio

I have a YouTube Stream that is supposed to be constantly making sound. In the event that something is not working as expected, I would like to set up some form of alert so that I can investigate what is not working. I would like to run this monitor somewhere completely isolated from the streaming server, so I had initially intended to run it as a browser extension on a separate computer.
I've tried working directly with the YouTube Streaming API, but haven't found anything that specifically allows me to detect audio. I can detect if the entire stream is down, but in the event that the stream is running while audio has stopped I'm SOL.
I've also started investigating building a browser extension that checks the current webpage for audio, but I've had difficulty isolating the element that generates audio on a youtube page.
Any suggestions on how to approach this problem would be very much appreciated.
