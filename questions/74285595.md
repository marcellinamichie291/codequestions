# how to automate operations to perform on a third party mobile application?

There is an android mobile application that runs a reward system and when we open the screen it makes us spin a wheel 5 times and if we are lucky we get some app coins. I don't want to manually open this application every day I want to write an application that runs at a specified time that will launch the other app and do the operations for me.
how can I achieve this? I don't have the source code for the other app.
unfortunately, the application doesn't have a web UI for me to go and write a javascript.
