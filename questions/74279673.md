I would like to export my Views to an image, which is easy, but I also want to be able to establish a correlation between pixel row and the values in the vertical axis for the purposes of aligning this image with others which are so scaled using a different workflow.
Any suggestions how I might accomplish this?
Thanks.
This can be done using a manual workflow but I would like to avoid that and do it programmatically if possible. I will entertain suggestions.
