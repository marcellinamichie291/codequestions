# Is there a way to assert the direction of a page in Testcafe? (e.g. assert RTL is true)

I am about to write an integration test for a webapp with functionality to flip between RTL and LTR via <dir="auto">. In testcafe, is there a way to dictate or assert that the direction is RTL or would I have to output something in the page source to assert on?
Any help on this would be great, thank you!
