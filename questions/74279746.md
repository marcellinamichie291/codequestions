# While clicking on the url I want to open the login popup in my application

Login popup does have the separate url. Login is done by modal popup. So I want to sent a link by email so that the user can click on the link and it will directly opens the login popup.
Is there any solution using vue js
While checking the query params it is returning login object but based on that how I will check the condition
