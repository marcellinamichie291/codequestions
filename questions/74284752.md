# How to log to both stream and file for uWSGI?

Here's my uWSGI app.ini :
# The following article was referenced while creating this configuration
# https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/configuring-uwsgi-production-deployment/
# Please make changes according to your application's expected load, etc

                                       ; consolidate logs, and manage many other features

When I run this (in a dockerized container) -
uwsgi --wsgi-file src/app.py --http-socket :9000 --callable app --ini app.ini

Here's what I see:

# ... app logs follow 

In the file, no uWSGI logs are present. App logs show up on the console as well as in the log file.
When I uncomment the logger parameter, I see ONLY:
[uWSGI] getting INI configuration from app.ini

No more logs
How can I generate uWSGI logs for both the console & file logging?
