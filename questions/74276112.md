Size differences in xcode builds vs jenkins builds.
We are trying automate build process for our project which has one framework and one IPA  creations step. We used Jenkins as CI/CD tool, able to create framework/IPA successfully. But we noticed there are size differences in xcode vs jenkins builds.
