# traverse array of objects and show image according to a type

I have an array of objects in a state in pinia, I get this array in my component. I am trying to show an image or others according to a value that is in the object, I make a function where I go through the array here and using switch I check the type, and return the image that corresponds to the type, I do this but I only get returns the first image if I use a for, if I do it with forEach it returns null, I try to save the value in the function because it is the one that I command to call to show the image, how can I do this so that according to a type I show a different image?

Function where you tried to get the images

const imgSelect = () => {
  for(let i = 0; i < obj.value.length; i++){
      switch(obj.value[i].type){
            case 'one':
              return new URL('../assets/images/image1.png', import.meta.url).href
              break;
            case 'two':
              return new URL('../assets/images/image2.png', import.meta.url).href
              break;
            case 'three':
              return new URL('../assets/images/image3.png', import.meta.url).href
              break;
            default:
              return null
              break;
      }
  }
}


here I try to use the image, it is to show it on a map as a markup and show one image or another depending on the type

const imageMarker = imgSelect
