# How to delete multiple files matching two specific lines in Linux

I have 1,000+ files and I would like to remove in all of them the following two lines that appear one after another.
<noscript>
</noscript>

I can't remove them individually because some files have actual content in between those tags.
Is there a way to do it recursively?
If that would help, I could add something specific in between and then remove those.
Example:
<noscript>
REMOVE-ABOVE-AND-BELOW
</noscript>

The issue with that would be that some files have it inline.
Example:
<noscript>REMOVE-ABOVE-AND-BELOW</noscript>
