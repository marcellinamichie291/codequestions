# R generating simulated data set with response variables being a function of 2 predictor variables and random variable

I am trying to generate a data set that has the following: a continuous variable (a number between 1 - 10 reflecting animals body size) together with the explanatory variables: season, weather, fish abundance. weather should have no effect on body size (random fill), but season and fish abundance are aimed to be related to body size (the parameters of the distribution of the response are aimed to be a function of 2 predictor variables). Which relation is not so important.. Could be a linear one between body size and fish abundance and similar with season (e.g. in summer highest body size).
I started writing the following code but I dont know how to define that season and fish are related to body size. I could manually define e.g. fill all body sizes bigger than X with summer and all smaller than X with winter etc but I am sure there is a more elegant solution.... Someone has advise?
Here the code I have so far..
y <- seq(0,10, length=400)
index<-dnorm(y, mean=5, sd=2)
index

plot(index)

season <- c("winter", "summer", "spring", "fall")
weather <- c("sun", "storm", "cloudy", "rain")
fishi <-   dnorm(100, mean=50, sd=5)
fishi
x <- seq(0,100, length=400)
fishi<-dnorm(x, mean=50, sd=2)
fishi

data <- data.frame(tern)


emp.data <- data.frame(
  index = index,
  weather = ,
  season = ,
  fishi = )



data <- rep(NA, 400)

for(i in 1:100){
  
  
  data[i] <- 
  
  
}
````

Thanks so much for help!
