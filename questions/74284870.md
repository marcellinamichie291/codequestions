# Restart NodeJS app running in docker container

I have a nodejs app running in several docker containers in production mode. One of them is running backend app.
I want to know how to force this container to restart on some event programatically( for example system time has changed)? I need the same behaviour just as I would type ‘docker restart container-name’. The docker restart policy is set to always.
Thank you,
Tried process.exit() but not sure why docker daemon is not restarting
