# Search string starting with OR keyword in elastic search

I want to make an elastic search query for invoice numbers which may start with OR keyword. Elastic search doesnt return any result for invoices starting with "OR" whereas it returns result for invoices starting with for instance "OP".
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "OR AND 123123",
      "default_field": "invoice_number"
    }
  }
}

I tried these but they didnt work:
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "(OR) AND (123123)",
      "default_field": "invoice_number"
    }
  }
}

{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "OR 123123",
      "operator" : "AND",
      "default_field": "invoice_number"
    }
  }
}
