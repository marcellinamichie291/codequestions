# elementor pro - menu cart - link getting broken by popup cart

Im using elementor pro, I have a header that has the menu cart in there and all works fine, but the mobile header is different and I am trying to add the menu cart as a popup icon on page load. When i do this it breaks the link of the desktop header menu cart even though the popup is hidden on desktop. how can i fix this?
I am open to suggestions, not tried anything yet.
