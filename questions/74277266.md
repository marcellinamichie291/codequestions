    {
    if(!$request->hasFile('image')) {
        return response()->json(['upload_file_not_found'], 400);
    }
    $file = $request->file('image');
    if(!$file->isValid()) {
        return response()->json(['invalid_file_upload'], 400);
    } 
    $path = Storage::putFile('logements', $request->file('image'));
    return response()->json($path);
  }
