# Disable new line formatting in SCSS

Since probably version 13 or 14 Netbeans is forcing new line after every property so:
#nav { @include flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; align-items: stretch; flex: 1; }

becomes
#nav {
    @include flex;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    align-items: stretch;
    flex: 1;
}


Tools > Options > Editor > Formatting

has only Tabs And Indents option for CSS
Is there any way to disable new lines in formatting?
