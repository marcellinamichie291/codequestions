# auto play video element in html reactJs

I tried this code to implement the autoplay video feature without the control bars but the issue that I faced was, the video was not autoplaying after refreshing the page. this project is in react. even after adding an autoplay attribute, the video is not autoplaying. what's the mistake am I doing?
I expect it to be autoplaying even after refreshing the page
