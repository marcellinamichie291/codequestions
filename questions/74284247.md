# I am calculating balance qty from total qty and invoice qty. Each time it is calculating qty from same total qty but not from remaining total qty

If I have total qty = 100.
and it has been shipped in 4 phases line 40, 10, 25, 25 that equals to 100.
when I am running this query:
SELECT pl.quantity, pr.invoiceqty, (pl.quantity - pr.invoiceqty)balance 
FROM purchaseorderline pl, replenishmentrequisition pr

I am getting result like this :




--total qty--
--invoice qty--
--balance qty--




100
40
60


100
10
90


100
25
75


100
25
70




The result I want :




--total qty--
--invoice qty--
--balance qty--




100
40
60


60
10
50


50
25
25


25
25
00




Can someone help me with this situation.
