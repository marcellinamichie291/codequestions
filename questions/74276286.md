so i have this problem,
I want to make posts save them to mysql database and select them back once they are needed.
but i couldn't figure out how to how to do multiple pages.
One is simple you just select last 10 items or 10 items with biggest id. But i do not know how to select last ten but after the first 10, like top 20 but you get rid of duplicates of previous seen.
I also don't know how to do page number list.
I use expressjs with mysql.
this is sql code i use to get last 10 added
    SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;

what i want is something like
    SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10 in range >10 & <=20;

If you have any idea please let me know.
I trtied to google it but I couldn't find any advice
