# Implementing a semaphore in ARM using SWP

In this webiste, the following code is given for implementing a semaphore in ARM.
LOCKED EQU 0         ; define value indicating

 LDR   r1, <addr>    ; load semaphore address
 LDR   r0, =LOCKED   ; preload "locked" value

spin_lock
 SWP   r0, r0, [r1]  ; swap register value with semaphore
 CMP   r0, #LOCKED   ; if semaphore was locked already
 BEQ   spin_lock     ;     retry

Why is SWP used here? Why is the comparison not done with register r1 itself? Has it got to do something with the fact that SWP is an atomic instruction?
