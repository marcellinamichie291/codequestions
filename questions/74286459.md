# Electron js / inter-process communication to initialize an app

I would like to know the best practice to initialize an Electron app.
I decided to manage the configuration on the main side.
I have a class that load the config.json file with all the methods to get properties.
I have doubts about the flow to populate the renderer view with data.
Here my thoughts:

renderer (function) -> preload (invoke) -> main (handle) -> return to preload -> return to renderer
main (webContents.send) -> preload.on(callback) -> renderer (callback)

Is there any other better way to do that?
Is it correct to have all the config on the main side?
thank you
