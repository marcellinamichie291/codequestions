# Trying to iterate through arrays and annotate them

I'm plotting graphs and I want to plot the values of the peaks which I've found using scipy. Now i have 2 numpy arrays that are the x values and y values of each peak. I want to go through these peaks and annotate all that are between the chosen x limits (xlim) as I plot both the full x and a zoom in of the peaks.
I've tried to just annotate all the values but I can't get that to work.
for i in x[0:-1]:
     plt.annotate(str(int(y[i])),(x[i],y[i])) 

Gives me IndexError: only integers, slices (:), ellipsis (...), numpy.newaxis (None) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices and if i do astype(int) i get IndexError: index 8 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 7 which I don't understand as I'm indexing from 0 to -1?
Can you help me with what I am trying to do and add something that limits it to only run plt.annotate for x values in the range of xlim? Thanks a lot
