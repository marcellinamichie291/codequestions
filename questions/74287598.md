# Java - sort string, starting with numbers

I need to sort such type of strings:
1, 1N, 1N2, 11Z1 etc.
First it should be sort by number then if there is a letter - sort by letter, then if it is  number by number and so on. So for example if I have these two strings: 1N and 11N24, it should be sort like that: 1N, 11N24 (default sort is in reverse order). Anyone has idea how to write such comparator? Thanks
