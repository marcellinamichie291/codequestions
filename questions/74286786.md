# Azure AD B2C - SAML Integration Custom Policies - Disable InResponseTo check

I have custom policies setup within our Azure AD B2C tenant to setup a SAML based signin SP initiated flow. On receipt of the response from the third party IDP I get the exception "The response has an invalid relay cookie".
I believe this is because the IDP's response is missing the InResponseTo property. Having spoken to said IDP, they are not able to send back the InResponseTo property in their response.
Is there a way to either remove the InResponseTo property from our initial request, OR is it possible to disable checking the InResponseTo attribute on receipt of the response?
I've successfully run a signin using the same custom policies in B2C, but using https://samltest.id/start-sp-test/ as the IDP instead, and can see the InResponseTo property returned in the response from here. So this is the only thing I have been able to identify as the a possible cause.
I know this is bad practice / a security flaw, but we are trying to prove we can get the identity flow working with this third party, with a view this will be fixed at a later date.
