@Entity
@Data
@Table(name = "PORTAL")
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Portal {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(generator = "PORTAL_ID_SEQ")
    @Column(name = "PORTAL_ID")
    private Integer id;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "PORTAL_SERV_ID", nullable = false)
    private Service service;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "SOMEABC_PRDCT_ID", nullable = false)
    private Product Product



Based on the table structure attached I had designed the entity. But I'm not sure about the mapping and the fetch type is defined as exact. We have the primary key as ID, and we have multiple services for some product as defined in column2 and column3.
