# iOS to Android file transfer between device connected in the same Wifi network

I have to develop 2 mobile applications, an iOS app to send file and an Android app to receive file. The purpose is to transfer files from iOS to Android device which are connected in the same Wifi network. I have checked SoftApp and WifiDirect. But both are using hotspot to establish connection and transfer data.
Is its possible to transfer files between iOS and Android device connected in the same network, without using Wifi hotspot?
Thank You in advance
