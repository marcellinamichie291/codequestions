# Pulling code from Bitbucket onto a AWS EC2 Instance

After using RDP to access my EC2 I'm trying to use Git to pull my code from Bitbucket onto the instance so I can access it there.
Currently I'm getting the error
ssh: connect to host *******: Connection timed out
fatal: Could not read from remote repository

Is there some changes I need to make to the security groups to be able to access bitbucket?
I've attempted to:

Use ssh config setting but it doesn't make a difference
Change some security group settings but I don't really know what I'm doing so I might be changing the wrong thing
