# Raw query in Prisma Query Console

I'm trying to run a raw query in the Prisma Query Console of the Data Platform.
The line
await prisma.$queryRaw(Prisma.sql`SELECT * FROM "public"."User";`)

Returns a PrismaClientUnknownRequestError error with the message

$queryRaw is a tag function, please use it like the following:

const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ${1} OR email = ${'user@email.com'};

Or read our docs at https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access#queryraw

If instead I replace it by the following as suggested by the message
await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM "public"."User";`

The the code is greyed and the execute button is disabled so I can't run the query.

How can I run raw queries in the Query Console?
