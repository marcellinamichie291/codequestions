# I'm trying to calculate 3 days from today, but not include weekend or holidays, but

The workday function should work for this.  I have a Range called "Holidays".  The problem is that workdays doesn't count the weekend days.  I need to count the weekend days.  BUT, if the 3rd day comes on a weekend or a holiday choose the next non-weekend or non-holiday day.  A2 is the Effective Date of the contract, which is the start date.  I'm trying to calculate the day on which the Earnest Money is due.  See the attached chart as to how it should calculate.
=if(OR(A5="",A5>workday(A2,3,Holidays)),workday(A2,3,Holidays),"") is the formula I have but it works for Effective dates that fall on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but not for Effective dates that fall on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
