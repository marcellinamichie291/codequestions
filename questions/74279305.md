# Specify host to a database running on a docker container

I have a .Net app that connects to the PostgreSQL database. The .Net app is running directly on my machine and the PostgreSQL is running in a docker container on my machine.
The docker-compose section that brings up Postgres is:
version: "3.8"

services:
  db_in_docker:
    image: postgres
    container_name: mydb
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
      POSTGRES_DB: testdb
    volumes:
      - local_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

To connect to this database from .Net app, I specify a connection string:
"HOST = localhost; PORT = 5432; DATABASE = 'testdb'; PASSWORD = 'test'; USER ID = 'test'"

Here the host is set to localhost. This works because my machine is the host and I can forward 5432 to the container's port 5432.
However, when both the .NET app and database are running in separate containers, this doesn't work. In that case, I have to specify the name of the service that is in the docker-compose file and update the connection string to HOST = db_in_docker
Question: Is it possible to assign a host for the database connection that will work locally as well as inside a docker container?
