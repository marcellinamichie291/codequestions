# Why does WebSocket On Open not work inside of a class method but works outside of it?

I have been debugging this morning and essentially boiled down my problem to the following scenario:
// This solution works without a problem
const OnSocketOpen = () => {
     console.log("This will never be called");
}
const OnSocketMessage = () => {
     console.log("This will eventually be called, with an error");
}
ws.on('open', OnSocketOpen); // this works
ws.on('message', OnSocketMessage); // this works

// This solution 'open' never works, but 'message' will eventually receive a timeout
class SocketManager {
    constructor() {
        this.ws = new WebSocket(ENDPOINT);
    }
     OnSocketOpen = () => {
          console.log("This will never be called");
     }
     OnSocketMessage = () => {
          console.log("This will eventually be called, with an error");
     }
     Test = () => {
          ws.on('open', this.OnSocketOpen.bind(this)); // FAILS to call OnSocketOpen
          ws.on('message', this.OnSocketMessage.bind(this)); // this works (with timeout msg)
     }
}

I've tried so many different types of class / function rewrites in JS and including anonymous and standard functions, using a class vs a function as the containing object, binding the method.  For whatever reason 'open' will never call OnSocketOpen if I call ws.on('open', OnSocketOpen) from inside a class method.  Any thoughts?
