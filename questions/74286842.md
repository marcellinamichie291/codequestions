# How to not return a key if its value is None in a recursive function

I have return statement within a recursive function that looks like this:
def recursive_function(data):
....
return {f'uid': uid,'title': title, 'string': string,'create-time': create_time, 'edit-time': edit_time, 'children': children, 'refs': refs}

Sometimes some of these values can be None (ex: when the title has a value, the string's value will be None, and vice-versa). The application I'm using does not recognize keys with None values, how do I prevent those keys from returning when the values are None?
Thank you in advance.
