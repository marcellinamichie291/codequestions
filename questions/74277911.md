I try to "create a new project from version control" in ij, and I have done this (same repo) before, but this time I get the above error and "clone" button doesn't get active. why and what can I do? it gives me a link to 'fix path'
I try to create a new project from version control, it must clone the project from the repo of github that I've cloned before and it worked fine. but today I got the error "invalid path to command line tools" and a link to 'fix path'. how can I fix this issue?
