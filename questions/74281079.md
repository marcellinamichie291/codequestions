# SQL to Doctrine QueryBuilder with Symfony

Can someone help me with a complex sql statement and doctrine querybuilder for Symfony 6? I would need to convert the following select accordingly.
SELECT * FROM table_1
    WHERE 
    t_id = (
    SELECT t_id FROM table_2 WHERE 
    a_id = (select a_id from table_3 WHERE flag = :flag) 
    AND g_id = :g_id ORDER BY sort DESC LIMIT 1
    )
AND visible = 0 ORDER BY sort

Otherwise I would be interested if this sql statement is a good style or i should write it differently? thanks a lot!
