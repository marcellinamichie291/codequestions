# Right align vertical dot graph with DotExporter

I have a vertical dot graph with multiple layers of nodes and edges. The last level has different lengths of labels. I want to align these to the right of the img.

from anytree.exporter import DotExporter
from anytree import Node

example = Node("main", parent=None)
Node("This is a short second", parent=example)
Node("This is a longer second. I want this to align with the above on the right", parent=example)

DotExporter(example,
    options=[
       'graph [layout = dot, ranksep="1.5", nodesep="0.7"]',
       'rankdir ="LR"',
       'fontsize="11"',
       'node [fontname="Arial"]']
).to_picture("temp\example.png")
