# How to update efficiently in JPA/Spring?

I know similar questions have been posted in the past and the solution offered there was to use getOne(id) to fetch a proxy to perform updates on and then saving it. However, now it says getOne is deprecated.
Is there an alternative that allows us to do the same? I know an update query can be used but it wouldn't be the preferred solution.
Tried looking at the doc and old questions but didn't find a reasonable answer
