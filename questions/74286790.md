Basically what i'm trying to do is image warping without opencv.
I computed homography manually and this is the code that finds the position after transformation.
def warpPerspective(img, M, dsize):
    mtr = to_mtx(img)
    R,C = dsize
    dst = np.zeros((R,C,mtr.shape[2]))
    for i in range(mtr.shape[0]):
        for j in range(mtr.shape[1]):
            res = np.dot(M, [i,j,1])
            i2,j2,_ = (res / res[2] + 0.5).astype(int)
            if i2 >= 0 and i2 < R:
                if j2 >= 0 and j2 < C:
                    dst[i2,j2] = mtr[i,j]
    
    return to_img(dst)

Here, homography matrix M divides two resultant x y with z values.
To avoid divide by zero, this code add 0.5 with z values.
My question is, is it okay to do this? and how can i handle this?
I feel like this may incurr lots of errors.
What i want to do is to interpolate from 4 neighbors  but I cannot think of better ways to handle divide by zero rather than adding small value.

Thank you inadvance
i thought of adding smaller value but this may cause f/z to be too big.
