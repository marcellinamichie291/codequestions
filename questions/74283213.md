# SQL Add and Divide same column values based on another columnb


The Yield values need to be created in the Measure column which is based on the same column values.
That is the Value of (Saleable MetIN+Saleable Thermal)/FeedIN.
I tried using CTE but the query is getting too big.
Columns Names:
YEAR,
ANO_MONTH,
ANO_WEEK,
MONTH_CODE,
WEEK_CODE,
EQMTID,
MEASURE,
VALUE
