# How is it that the port channel is forming when I have set the allowed vlan on both ends to be different, when they should be the same?

SW1
interface Port-channel1
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-4
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
SW2
interface Port-channel1
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-6
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
I'd like to know why an etherchannel is forming when the allowed vlans on both ends are different.
