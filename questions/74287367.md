# How do I schedule a notification in Android 13?

Previous questions on Stack Overflow do not account for Android 13's new permission model, hence I am opening a new question.
My app currently uses an AlarmManager to set a notification for a user at a pre-defined point in the future. Think of this as a 'reminder' before an event happens, at a period defined by the user (e.g 0/1/5/15/30 minutes before the event)
In Android 13, there are 2 new permissions I now need to think about:

SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM – To schedule a PendingIntent to wake up the device to deliver a notification. The reminder/notification is a secondary feature in my app, which I why I do not use the other permission (USE_EXACT_ALARM)
POST_NOTIFICATIONS – To actually show the notification to the user.

Does this mean that for new users to my app, I will now need to send them through two separate permission acceptance flows?
Specifically, for POST_NOTIFICATIONS a runtime dialog to accept or deny notifications AND for SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM an Intent to the user's Settings app to allow alarms & reminders (so that I can schedule notifications in the future).
Two separate permission flows feels sub-optimal. Am I reading this correctly, or is there a more user-friendly way to schedule notifications in the future?
