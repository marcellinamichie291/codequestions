# Is there way to create multiple barcodes from a list?

I am trying to create a script to generate barcodes from a given list. In this case from a txt file, with each line being a name/input for the barcode.The code is not the cleanest, still a work in progress :P
from PIL import Image
import barcode
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import filedialog
import os
from ttkSimpleDialog import ttkSimpleDialog
from barcode.writer import ImageWriter

options = {
    'dpi': 1100,
    'font_size':15,
    'module_height': 7,
    'text_distance':12.0,
    }

image_path="C:/Users/*/Desktop/Created Barcodes"

textFile= filedialog.askopenfilename()
  
f= open(textFile, "r").readlines()
for i in f:
    lines = [i.strip() for i in f]
    print(lines)
    number = (f"{lines}")

barcode_format = barcode.get_barcode_class('code128')

 #Generate barcode and render as image
image_writer = ImageWriter().set_options(options)
image = barcode_format(number, writer=ImageWriter(),)
  
isExist = os.path.exists(image_path)
if not isExist:
    os.mkdir(image_path)
  
 #Save barcode as PNG    
image= image.save(rf"{image_path}/{number}")



I am pretty new to python but from what I experimented in the code, I think that I am doing something wrong/missing on the following part:
for i in f:
    lines = [i.strip() for i in f]
    print(lines)
    number = (f"{lines}")



I tried changing the code and it did print the text but in one line. Which created one gigantic barcode with all the data.
