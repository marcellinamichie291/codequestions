# FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] File b'filepath.csv' does not exist:

I created a df to read a csv in my jupyter notebook library but for some reason the i'm getting an error like this:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] File b'file path/filename.csv' does not exist: b'/file path/filename.csv'

My code is this:
df_csv = pd.read_csv('../file_path/file_name.csv', low_memory=False)

I believe I am using the absolute path to this file...I also checked the directory to confirm I was using the correct path.
import os

print(os.path.abspath('file_name.csv'))

and the output was:
/YXRwLW5vdGVib29rLW5pbmd1eWVuLXNlc3Npb24teGJ1YQ==/file_path/file_name.csv

Is that not the same as '../file_path/file_name.csv'? Would appreciate any troubleshooting tips...
