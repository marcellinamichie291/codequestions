# Dyanmic Where Clause

Is there a way to make your comparison operator dynamic?
EG:
SELECT
    *

FROM TABLE

WHERE
    IIF(@FLAG_A = 'True', COLUMN_A = @COLUMN_A, COLUMN_A <> @COLUMN_A)
AND IIF(@FLAG_B = 'True', COLUMN_B = @COLUMN_B, COLUMN_B <> @COLUMN_B)
AND IIF(@FLAG_C = 'True', COLUMN_C = @COLUMN_C, COLUMN_C <> @COLUMN_C)

I tried the above example with my parameters set as @FLAG_A = 'True', @FLAG_B = 'False' @FLAG_C = 'False'
I was expecting this query to run:
SELECT
    *

FROM TABLE

WHERE
    COLUMN_A = @COLUMN_A
AND COLUMN_B <> @COLUMN_B
AND COLUMN_C <> @COLUMN_C

But I'm getting:
Incorrect syntax near '='.
