# python iterate loop and change values in dictionary


I'm trying to iterate over the loop to change the value of the dictionary. lines have a different baseball teams in each line . When I print the years, it prints out the keys correctly, but the value is all changed to the last element of the lines.
For example,
1903: 'NY Yankees', 1905: 'NY Yankees' ... 2021: 'NY Yankees'.
How do I make it to assign the correct values into the dictionary?
    lines = a.readlines()
    print(lines)
    for i in range(1903,2022):
        if i == 1904:
            continue
        elif i == 1994:
            continue
        else:
            years.update({i:i})
            for j in lines:
                years.update({i:j})  

I expect to get when I print years,
1903:'First line in the lines', 1905: 'Second line in the lines' ...
What really resulted:
1903: 'Last element in lines' 1905: 'Last element in lines' ...
