Is there any problem with Firebase authentication?
I am not receiving any email (verification or reset) from yesterday.
I can't even send reset email from console manually
I have checked spam folder also.
Here is my code
FirebaseAuth.getInstance().sendPasswordResetEmail(email)
                    .addOnSuccessListener(unused -> {
                        //is called
                    })
                    .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
                    });

Above code worked before, but recently I am facing this issue. I have tried to send reset password to an email through firebase authentication manually, but it's not working even.
More info:
If I add user manually and send email, it shows email sent successfully. But I don't receive any mail.
