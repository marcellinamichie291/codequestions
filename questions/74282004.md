# Imputation of missing features in python shap

I am looking for the part of the code in the shap python library that corresponds to replacing the missing feature value with the amount from the background data. In which parts of the code and by which function this value(I guess mean of the missing variable in the background data) is computed?
I looked at the https://github.com/slundberg/shap page but couldn't find it.
