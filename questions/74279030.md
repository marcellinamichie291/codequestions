# How to auth in MongoDB client via IAM role in C#

Java MongoDB driver has this neat example of IAM auth: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/v4.6/fundamentals/auth/#std-label-mongodb-aws-auth-mechanism
It also says that "driver supports refreshing credentials for cases such as assuming roles or using Elastic Kubernetes Service".
I need to implement basically the same, but in C# using C# MongoDB driver: with automatic credentials refresh (because they expire and must be recreated).
Does anybody have an example of the code that implements exactly that?
I've found a MongoAWSAuthenticator https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.18/apidocs/html/T_MongoDB_Driver_Core_Authentication_MongoAWSAuthenticator.htm but I'm unsure how to properly use it with IAM role.
Especially how to configure automatic credentials refresh
