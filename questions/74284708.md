# MUI Data table cells not reflecting API response data when I go from page 1 to 2 in react

Lets say I have a parent component in inside which a child component is there which is a MUI data table. This child component receives API response data as props from parent component.
Issue
Data on the table is perfectly loaded on page load but when I move from page 1 to 2 using MUI data table pagination which passes the page number to parent and in parent component the API function is called inside useEffect() hook, which gets called when this data is received. I am able to log the API response data during pagination on the child component but these data are not loaded onto the table cells
I tired to useState() hook on the child component to set the data but it was of no help
