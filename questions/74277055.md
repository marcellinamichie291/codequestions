# Gutenprint - impossible to find driver for HITI manufacturer

I installed Gutenprint and I can see on the DYESUB that the gutenprint application have driver for HITI printer. However when I connect mine and I try to select a printer driver there is none available. Is there a trick to make them visible ?
