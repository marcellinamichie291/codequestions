# Angular 14 - Check when all observables are completed

I have a service which contains observable as below
private _actionSaveSubject: BehaviorSubject<string> = new BehaviorSubject<string>( null );
actionSave$: Observable<string> = this._actionSaveSubject.asObservable();

private _actionAfterSaveSubject: BehaviorSubject<string> = new BehaviorSubject<string>( null );

In my components (Component1 and Component2) I inject the service and call the actionSave$ as below
    this.actionService.actionSave$
        .pipe(
            takeUntil( this._unsubscribeAll ),
            skip(1),
            tap(t => {/* TODO saving */ }),
        )
        .subscribe()

In my service I want to know when both the components have finished their actionSave$ observable so that I can call _actionAfterSaveSubject.next(). Is there anyway I can do that?
