# Notifications of facebook youtube and instagram on third party super app

We are developing a super app. A super app is where we can open facebook, youtube, instagram, telegram and many other apps in Iframes. We have done it and all the apps are working fine on our super app. But the problem is we do not get notifications from these apps on our super app. Can anyone help us with how can we get notification on android and iOS for all these big apps on our super app?
