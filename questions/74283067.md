# Constructor error anytime I use private variables in VS Code

We're learning about constructors in class and I was trying to experiment with an overloaded constructor. When I run my program I keep getting an error written in the color red that says...
        ~

The ampersand (&) character is not allowed. The & operator is reserved for future use; wrap an ampersand in double quotation marks ("&") to pass it as part of a string.
^This only happens when I try to use private variables, when everything is public nothing goes wrong.
///Here's my code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class JCole {
private:
    string song;
    string album;
    int albumNum;

    JCole::JCole(string _song, string _album, int _Num) {
        song = _song;
        album = _album;
        albumNum = _Num;
    }
};

int main() {
    JCole album1("Punchin the clock", "The Off-Season", 6);
    JCole album2("ATM","KOD",5);
    cout << album1.song << " " << album1.album << " " << album1.albumNum << endl;
    cout << album2.song << " " << album2.album << " " << album2.albumNum << endl;
    return 0;
}
