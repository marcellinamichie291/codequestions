# 'bytes' object is not callable python

I am having a peculiar bug which I cannot solve. It is strange as my code has worked earlier today and I have no clue how I broke this.
I am reading in a serial printed canbus message with
while not done:

        line = can.readline() # R  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

        numbers = line.split()

        try:
                str  =     numbers[0]
                command    = int(numbers[1]) # cast to integer
                param1     = int(numbers[2]) 
                param2     = int(numbers[3]) 
                param3     = int(numbers[4]) 
                param4     = int(numbers[5]) 
                param5     = int(numbers[6])
                param6     = int(numbers[7]) 
        except:
                print("invalid string" )

        print( type(param3))

        direction = str.decode()     # cast to string    
        if direction == 'R':
                print("receiving")

        match command:
                case 0: # send version number
                        print("version number request")

        # etc

Later in this switch case I call the function printMotor()
The faulty lines are marked in comment with the appropiate error
direction = 'B' #dummy values
command = 0
param1 = 0
param2 = 0
param3 = 0
param4 = 0
param5 = 0
param6 = 0

def printMotor():
        
        print( type(param3))             # <-- <class 'int'>
        print( type(param2))             # <-- <class 'int'>

        val = str(param3 << 8 | param2 ) # <-- TypeError: 'bytes' object is not callable

        match param1:
                case 1: #stop
                        print("stop")

                case 2: #turn left
                        print("ccw: " + val )

                case 3: #turn right
                        print("cw: " + val )

                case 4: #to position
                        print("to pos: " + val )

I checked that the type of param3 and param2 are integers. AFAAIK this code should be perfectly fine but it isn't anymore. I have seen correct values today. How did I break this? How do I fix this?
