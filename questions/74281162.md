# Return documents depending on matching a given search set with accumulated distinct arrays from a document field

I have set with strings like this: a,b
and a collection like this:
{
    "owner": "anna",
    "letters": ["c"]
},

{
    "owner": "bob",
    "letters": ["b", "c"]
},

{
    "owner": "cai",
    "letters": ["a", "b"]
},
{
    "owner": "dora",
    "letters": ["a", "d"]
},
{
    "owner": "emil",
    "letters": ["a"]
},
{
    "owner": "fry",
    "letters": ["b"]
},

I want to get a random collection of documents where the set a,b matches a subset of accumulated distinct sets of the field "letters" of all documents in the collection.
A valid solution would be:
{
"owner": "cai",
"letters": ["a", "b"]
}


Also valid:
{
"owner": "emil",
"letters": ["a"]
},
{
"owner": "fry",
"letters": ["b"]
},


Also valid, since the sets of "letters" are distinct:

{
"owner": "emil",
"letters": ["a"]
},
{
"owner": "bob",
"letters": ["b", "c"]
},


Also valid:
{
"owner": "bob",
"letters": ["b", "c"]
},
{
"owner": "dora",
"letters": ["a", "d"]
},


NOT valid would be the following, since "b" is in both documents (should only be in one):
{
"owner": "bob",
"letters": ["b", "c"]
},

{
"owner": "cai",
"letters": ["a", "b"]
}


Also NOT valid, since "a" is in both documents:

{
"owner": "emil",
"letters": ["a"]
},

{
"owner": "cai",
"letters": ["a", "b"]
},


With the aggregation pipeline, in tried to group the documents by the field "letters" and randomize the order of the documents. I am stuck at how to apply the set rules to only return distinct documents without intersections between the arrays of field "letters" to match the search set.
Thanks for your help!
