# Can background workers run even when the foreground is in a tight loop?

I have a background worker running doing its thing.  In the foreground, I have a tight while loop that only looks at a local variable to exit.  The local variable is set by an event handler triggered by the background worker.
My thought was that I would need to call sleep to allow the background thread to run, but that does not appear to be the case.  Why does this work?
This is a console app for test purposes, so no GUI thread.
        while (true)
        {
            //System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(50);

            /* Get out if scripts are finished. */
            if (!m_NfcScriptRunning)
                break;
        }
