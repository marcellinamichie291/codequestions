# Variable is empty after running first function

To elaborate:
I have 6 modules/functions in separate files which I try to run from main.py.
After running the first script, data is written to var data, which inserts that data to data.py < confirmed that the data is written.
After that, I run the next function function2() which then retrieves that data from data.py by import. The issue here is that it seems that function2 is preloaded, so that the data variable is empty.
How can I solve this issue? There are 6 functions using the same data, and I want to pull that from .py file, not store it in the cache.
Over 3 hours of trying, and I could not figure it out nor find a similar question. The data in the first function is written to the file perfectly. If I run the scripts apart, they all DO get the data correctly.
Example:
main.py
from functions import function1, function2
function1()
print("function 1 done")
function2()

function1.py
def function1():
    data = [1,2,3,4,5]
    f = open("/data/data.py", "w+")
    f.write("data ="+str(data))
    print(len(data))
    f.close()
    print(len(data)) -> output = 5

function2.py
from data.data import *
def function2():
    print(len(data))

output = 0
