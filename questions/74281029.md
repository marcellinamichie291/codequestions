# TABLEVIEW dynamic creation abap

I have a task to create tableview on a GUI screen dynamically. The control must be created dynamically fo different table types, because we need to maintain different tables. Is it possible in ABAP to create tableview dynamically? Or is it possible within ALV grids only?
