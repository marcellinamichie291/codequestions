# Why is my html and body getting reduced in height even if i set it to 100vh and even after removing the style it remains same?

My body and html element is reducing in size which i didn't intend to do even after removing all the styles.Here's a picture of it

Here is the link of the page https://karthik5860.github.io/huddle-landing-page-with-single-introductory-section-master/
I am expecting a reason on why this is happening and also I have heard position:fixed may solve the problem but it didn't solve the problem
