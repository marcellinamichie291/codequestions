# update sql row with time 1 hour before NOW()

hi i am having trouble updating a sql row
i want to set it so it updates row lastmergedate 1 hour before now
UPDATE `Table` SET `lastmergedate` = NOW() works for setting the time as now

but e.g UPDATE `Table` SET `lastmergedate` <= NOW() 1 interval hour does not work
any help would be much appreciated
tried
UPDATE `Table` SET `lastmergedate` <= NOW() 1 interval hour

but get mariadb errors
