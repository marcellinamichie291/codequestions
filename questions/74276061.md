# How I can select rows from a dataframe with a specific columns value?

I have one dataframe (peak.anno_C1_4) with 5578 obs and 19 variables and a list of value (intestine_unique) that I want to check if they are in one of the dataframe's columns, and if they are in, I want to extract the corresponding rows in a new dataframe (with all the 19 variable)
intestine_unique <- c("atm-1", "cdc-3", "fgf-5")

peak.anno_C1_4 

chr  start    end       name
1    12345   12347     atm-1
1    2345    2344      cdc-3
2    3456    3455      fgf-5
2    4567    4566      dfr-3


I want only the first three rows so I do this loop but it doesn't work
intestine<-data.frame()

for (i in 1:length(intestine_unique)){
  for (j in 1:length(peak.anno_C1_4$SYMBOL)){
    if (i == j)
      intestine <- peak.anno_C1_4
  }
}

Can someone help me?
