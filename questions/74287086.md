# asp.net: Default error page - order of displayed exceptions

I have a asp.net application which sometimes throws some errors, presented in default style of asp.net. However, for troubleshooting I like to know, if the trace is top-down or bottom-up.
If you look the picture below, was the exception trace like:

start from most
outer->WebException->HttpRequestException->IoException->InvalidOperationException->end
to most inner

or was it

start form most inner->InvalidOperationException->IoException->HttpRequestException->WebException->end
to most outer


Can you enlighten me?
