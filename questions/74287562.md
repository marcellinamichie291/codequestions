# How can I implement a scheduler as a subclass of the queue class as a doubly linked list?

I'm trying to make a scheduler for my queue class using a double linked-list, unfortunately I canâ€™t change the names of the functions or create new functions or variables, I have done my code below, but I don't really know where to start with the scheduler. Any help would be greatly appreciated as honestly, I am very unsure of the best way to implement this. It's ideally got to be a subclass of the Queue class, use an int value as a process ID, use an int value as a priority (1 = low, 10 = high), handle exceptions in case the priority value exceeds the above range, be able to schedule as many processes as there is memory available (this memory will need to be allocated on demand from the heap).
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Node
{
public:
Node(int value, Node* nextptr = NULL, Node* prevptr = NULL, int currentpriority = 0)
{
    this->value = value;
    next = nextptr;
    prev = prevptr;
    priority = currentpriority;                 
}
int getVal(void) {
    return value;
}
Node* getNext(void) {
    return next;
}
Node* getPrev(void) {
    return prev;
}
void setVal(int value) {
    this->value = value;
}
void setPrev(Node* prevptr) {
    prev = prevptr;
}
void setNext(Node* nextptr) {
    next = nextptr;
}
int getPriority(void) {
    return priority;
}
void setPriority(int priority) {
    this->priority = priority;
}

private:
Node* next;
Node* prev;
int priority;
int value;
};


class Queue
{
public:
 Queue(void) {
     front = back = nullptr;
 }
 
~Queue(void) {
    while (front != nullptr) {
        delete NodeDequeue();
    }
}

void Enqueue(int i, int priority = 0) {
    Node* temp = new Node(i, back);
    back = temp;
    if (front == nullptr) front = back;
    else{
        temp = back->getNext();
        temp->setPrev(back);
    }
}

int Dequeue(void) {
    Node* temp = NodeDequeue();
    int ret = 0;
    if (temp != nullptr) {
        ret = temp->getVal();
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "Queue is empty";
    }
    if (front == nullptr) back = nullptr;
    delete temp;
    return ret;
}

protected:
Node* back;
Node* front;
private:
virtual Node* NodeDequeue(void) {
    Node* temp = front;
    if (front != nullptr) {
        front = front->getPrev();
        if (front != nullptr) front->setNext(nullptr);
    }
    return temp;
}
    };

 class Scheduler : public Queue {
 private:
 Node* NodeDequeue(void);
 };
