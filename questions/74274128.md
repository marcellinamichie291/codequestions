# Server during deployment

Just a newbie here, I have been building a next.js web app, and in order to use a module (resemble) I have created a server.js file which works perfectly locally with "node server.js".
When I deployed on vercel how can use the server features? The build gets deployed without problem but how can my web app use the server api that were working locally?
const express = require("express");
const request = require("request");

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", process.env.ORIGIN || "*");
  next();
});

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const url = req.query["url"];
  request(
    {
      url: url,
      encoding: null,
    },
    (err, resp) => {
      if (!err && resp.statusCode === 200) {
        res.set("Content-Type", "image/jpeg");
        res.send(resp.body);
      }
    }
  );
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`f`));

Is there something I need to change on my code in the server file portwise?
