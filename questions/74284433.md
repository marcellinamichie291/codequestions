# Openpyxl - how to copy and paste the value of a cell into another file while sorting appropriately

I am a newbie to openpyxl. I am trying to write a script which will copy data from one workbook and paste it into the appropriate columns of another workbook.
I want my script to be able to look at the value (A, B, or C) of the first column, copy the cell value of the second column, and paste that value in into the appropriate column in the second workbook. See screenshot for example:

Currently I've been able to print the appropriate values from the first workbook. I'm unsure how to paste the data in the correct column of the second workbook. Would I need another for loop for the second workbook in order to target the correct cell? Once I target the correct cell, I assume it would be as simple as setting it equal to (cell.offset(column = + 1).value)
from openpyxl import load_workbook
from openpyxl import Workbook

wb = load_workbook('testData.xlsx')
wb2 = load_workbook('testTemplate.xlsx')

get_sheet = wb.sheetnames

for sheet in get_sheet:

    ws = wb[sheet]
    mr = ws.max_row

    for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row = 2, min_col = 1, max_row = mr, max_col = 2):
        for cell in row:
            if cell.value == "A":
                print((cell.offset(column = + 1).value))

            elif cell.value == "B":
                print((cell.offset(column = + 1).value))

            elif cell.value == "C":
                print((cell.offset(column = + 1).value))

wb2.save('testTemplate.xlsx')
