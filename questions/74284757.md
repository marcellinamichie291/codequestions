# Why compute method is throwing error only in tree view?

I'm using compute method to add records to the one2many field and it's working fine in form view but not in tree view. Can anyone help?
@api.depends("odoo_product_id")
def _compute_offers(self):
    for rec in self:
        if rec.odoo_product_id:
            offers = self.env['demo.offers'].search
                ([('product_id','=',rec.odoo_product_id.id)])
            for offer in offers:
                rec.shop_offer_ids = rec.shop_offer_ids + offer

It's throwing Compute method failed to assign Error in tree view only
