# How to make a generic getter like z.infer<> in Typescript

I've been learning Typescript for a few months and i started to discover zod recently, and i wonder how to build such a util getter such as z.infer<>, z.input<> or even z.output<>
What i understand is that z is a class that has a getter "method" that takes a generic and it returns a type, but i have no idea of how this works
I tried to replicate it but couldn't figure it out, can someone help?
