# Observable Object breaks Codable protocol compliance in observing struct despite conforming to Codable (SwiftUI)

I am confronted with a bit of a conundrum. I have an Observable Object MatrixStatus that is codable:
class MatrixStatus: ObservableObject, Codable{
    @Published var recalcTriggerd = false
    
    init(){}
    
    //Codable protocol
    enum CodingKeys: CodingKey{
        case recalcTriggered
    }
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(recalcTriggerd, forKey: .recalcTriggered)
    }
    required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        recalcTriggerd = try container.decode(Bool.self, forKey: .recalcTriggered)
    }
}

It is set up as an environment object by a View of a document. The document observes it and remains codable. However, if I observe it in a different struct, MatrixData, that is a property of the document, the MatrixData struct stops conforming to Codable
struct MatrixData: Codable, Equatable{
    @EnvironmentObject var calcStatus: MatrixStatus //triggers 'does not conform to codable'
    ...

Any suggestions how to solve, other than implementing the encode etc functions in MatrixData?
Thanks,
Lars
