# How to Export Dictionary Data to CSV

I'm new in python and I've been trying to save result of dictionary to csv file. However, I got an error which I dont know what it is. I used the search bar searching for similar case/recommended solution but still blur. Kindly share any insights and idea. Thanks in advance.
with open('hologram.csv','w') as f: 
f.write(",".join(['filename'] + [*res]) + "\n") 
for imgpath in glob.glob(os.path.join(TARGET_DIR, "*.png")):
    res = send_request_holo(imgpath)
    f.write(",".join([os.path.basename(imgpath)] + [*res.values()]) + "\n")  
    print(res)

The expected output in csv should be like this:-




filename
hologram_scores
hologram




img1.
0.0052322322
False


img2.
0.00.
False


img3.
0.0086543111
False


img4.
0.0052331209
True




Here is the error

Here is when printing the result (this is the one that need to be exported to csv)
