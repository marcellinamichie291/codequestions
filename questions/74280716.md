# How can I enable the result grid permanently and see the results? (results not shown) MySQL Workbench 2022

Screen recording
Whem I type a statement, like trying to build a table, the output doesn't show up after executing.
-- SELECT 'Hello', 'World'; -- SELECT 'Hello' as Firstword 'World' as Secondword;
I even went to the result grid to the side and it was shown empty.
How can I enable the result grid permanantly and have the output be displayed?
I am expecting a table to be made with the input displayed in the column described.
