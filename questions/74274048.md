# I need to check the my samples came from the same distribution? I used Kolmogorov Smirnov test but I couldn't understand it

I want to know about how to use kolmogorov Smirnov test and if anyone willing to explain that what i have to do after extracting features from multiple images using CNN. With the help of these features i need to perform KS test and also i am willing to know is there any other way is there.
(i took two different sample image datasets)after features extracted by CNN(VGG16), i normalize the features and and rehsape the features and perform PCA and run through the KS_2samp, this is my output
KstestResult(statistic=0.49853515625, pvalue=1.242376011953541e-231)

( i took same images dataset and split images into different folder and run the KS_2samp test) this is my output
KstestResult(statistic=0.3935546875, pvalue=6.0311675891650885e-142)

please, tell any one the proper procedure for KS test (after extracting features from images to kolmogorov Smirnov test)
also i am looking for (out of distribution for images) if anyone had any idea please mention it,thanks in advance.
