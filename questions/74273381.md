# How do i replace words in a .RTF file without destroying/corrupting the whole layout

So I am making an application that will take User info and paste it in a .RTF file. But when i try to paste the info into that file it will change the words but it will change the whole layout. The imagine, font, colours and links are all removed/changed and i don't know why.

As you can see the first picture is what i use for testing and the second picture is the outcome i get by only changing "BaseName".

Original

Outcome

// ENC is a Encoding code i tried to use but no results
// TempPathRTF is the path to the rtf file and I've tested it and it works
// tempUserData.Name is the User's name

var ENC = Encoding.GetEncoding("ISO-8859-1");
            string tempPathRTF = $"D:\\Downloads\\TempImageTesting\\WT-{tempUserData.Name.Replace(" ", "")}.rtf";
            string RTFFile = File.ReadAllText(tempPathRTF);
            RTFFile = RTFFile.Replace("BaseName", tempUserData.Name);
            File.WriteAllText(tempPathRTF, RTFFile, ENC);

If anyone knows why or how to write/change text in a .RTF file please let me know.
