I have agents pool that have different user capabilities (user paremeters). Also I have pipelines which contain different demands for agents. In other words, it is not possible to run pipeline in all agents.
How to find out which agents are suitable for running the pipeline?
How to check the possibility of running a pipeline on an agent?

I can get data (contains capabilities/paremeters) about agents using query:     https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/distributedtask/pools/{poolId}/agents?includeCapabilities=true
I can find out the data (demands) of manual-pipelines (pipelines created manually by users) using query:
https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/definitions/{definitionId}
But how to get the requirements of pipelines created using yaml files?
Unfortunately, I did not find an answer to my question.
