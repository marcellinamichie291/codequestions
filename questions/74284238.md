# Using ArrayFormula with Lookup functions

PS: Using Google Sheets
I have a Google Sheet that is populated by Google forms, and I'm looking to use this data to make a new sheet with the values when the column type is a particular value.
For ex, here are a few rows of my data:
Name    Date        Type        Reference No
John    10/11/2022  SSS         551200550
Peter   10/11/2022  Transfer    510568810
John    10/11/2022  SSS         5105688415
Peter   10/11/2022  Other       510568851

Now, I have 1000s of rows, and I want to make a new sheet for each 'type' (In the example it's SSS and Transfer, but I have a few different types)
Ex 1: For SSS, here is the sheet, and accordingly for other values in 'Type', it should go into another sheet
Name    Date        Type    Reference No
John    10/11/2022  SSS     551200550
John    10/11/2022  SSS     5105688415

Essentially, I want to pull data from the master data and want to create a new sheet for each different type. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using =ARRAYFORMULA(Sheet!A:A, IF(...)) or if I'm meant to use it with VLOOKUP.
Any ideas? Thanks for any help!
Tried with =ARRAYFORMULA(Sheet!A:A, IF(..)) but didn't get anywhere, looking for any help
