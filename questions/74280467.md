# Ctrl - left and right now working in Spark Shell in Windows 10

I installed Spark on Windows 10. Everything works fine except for the Ctrl - left and Ctrl - right keys which doesn't move a word but just a character. How do I fix this or find out what are the correct bindings to move a word in Spark Shell
