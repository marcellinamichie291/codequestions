# How to accurately take Num Digits voice input using Twilio twiML <gather> function?

We wish to take feedback rating of a product (1 star to 5 Star) using voice recognition via Twilio (using TwiML). We are facing below scenario issues:
When we use  function in twiML, then it records and transcribes voice input by customer. So if a customer says something like :
**Scenario 1: **" Ummm, I would like to give 4 stars"
**Scenario 2: ** "Wait 1 minute, I have decided, I want to give 3 stars"
Q1:Now in above scenario, we just want to parse 4 (from 4 stars) or 3 (from 3 stars) and not random digits like 1(from 2nd scenario) or rather not the entire line. How can we do that?
Q2 : Sometimes twilio  function also returns : FIVE STARS instead of 5 Stars - What to do in this case?
Q3 : Is there any service or library we can use which can find actual intent of the spoken line and give result to us limited to 1,2,3,4 and 5 ? We do have the audio file of the customer voice
Tried 2 things:

Tried using  function of twiML -- Results -- Not very accurate transcription + issues as stated above

Tried using Google Translate -- Recorded customer voice and sent to google for translation -- RESULT --Much better accuracy but unable to parse just the intent (no. of ratings)
