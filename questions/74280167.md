# RXJava buffer first elements after a debounce

I'm trying to buffer a stream by adding a delay to the initial elements emitted by an observable after a time gap.  In other words, I want to buffer elements for n seconds after a debounce occurs, but then emit every element after that first n seconds.  How can this be accomplished in RXJava?
