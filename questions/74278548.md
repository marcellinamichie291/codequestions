# Read and write data to a central database between multiple devices

So, I'm working on an android app that will have to record data to a central database. Because there will be multiple users adding to the database from different devices, I think I'll need to host it somewhere accessible to each device. I'm new to this concept but if anyone could recommend a way for me to create and host a database where multiple devices can read/write to that would be great. Thanks!!
