# Deleted files gives CS0246 compiler error in VS2022

I've added 3 default Blazor projects to my solution.

Blazor WebAssembly1
Blazor WebAsssembly2
Blazor Server

The first WebAssembly project is converted to a razor library in order to share code between server and webassembly projects. I also deleted the default pages like FetchData.razor and such.
On compilation I still get compile error on this (the app runs fine though), and I can't seem to resolve them. I've search through the entire solution but can't find any of the files that results in the compile errors.
How to locate the reason for the errors and remove the references? The files are deleted from the project.
