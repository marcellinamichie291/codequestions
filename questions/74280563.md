# In-app purchases Android Billing library 5

I need help.  I've been trying for several days and nothing works.  I do everything as described here:
https://www.answertopia.com/java-android/a-java-android-in-app-purchasing-tutorial/
I used to use Billing library v3 but they are removing it now.  I did everything as described on the page, but when I click the "buy" button, the app stops working.  I changed the following:
binding.buyButton.setEnabled(true);  buyButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
binding.consumeButton.setEnabled(true);
consumeButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
In-app purchases Android Billing library 5.
I click the "buy" button, the app stops working.
