# Can you emulate the zoom feature in chrome desktop

Has anyone been able to emulate chromes zoom using css or javascript ?
I've tried using REM , css zoom and scale and can not reproduce how Chrome zoom is working.
When i use chrome zoom it perfectly increases the page size and adjust all media query breakpoints perfectly. Using REM for all font sizes , widths ect , when i change base font size the breakpoints in "rem" or "em" don't scale like using zoom in chrome
