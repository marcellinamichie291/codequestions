# Cannot print NOP ('\x90') in terminal

I have a C program that writes a NOP character to stdout:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(char *argc, char *argv[]) {

    fwrite("\x90", 1, sizeof(char), stdout);

    return 0;
}

I also have another program that takes input, which i am runnning in gdb (so i can view the stack).
After running the first program i copy the NOP from stdout and paste it in GDB as input for the second program.
When viewing the stack i always get this value:
0x00bdbfef

When it should be
0x00000090

Why is this? The problem also seems to occur with python but i cannot pinpoint why.
