# How to write in a specific spot in TableView with JavaFX

I am in the process of self-training on the subject of graphic JavaFX
My goal is to be able to place an X in the corresponding box

I found several tutorials that explain how to write a partial or full row but only one field and depending on the column / row value ... I can't do it, I need help from the community to m 'open my eyes, so run my hoop lol
Thx in advance
Have a nice day/evening/night/morning
