# Can a large npy file be converted into small npy files?

I have a large npy file with 33,696 lines of data. I would like to separate this into 18 small files with 1872 lines of data in each. I have tried to use the same codes for converting a large text file into small text files but I am not able to receive the output that I want. What alternative codes can be used to achieve this?
I tried to repeat the same steps as done for the text file but did not receive the output that I wanted.
