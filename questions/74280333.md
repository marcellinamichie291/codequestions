# Uncaught SyntaxError in Jenkins but building/running fine in Local

I have a React app with webpack that is building and running fine in local. I am currently testing with a stripped down version that just renders a header text.
However, when I deploy through Jenkins to an S3 bucket, I am getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token (at bundle.js:2:55245) in the console. No build errors in Jenkins that stand out to me, other than warnings that I also get when I build locally. The error also doesn't specify a spcific token
Any insights or advice on avenues to pursue?
