# Anybody use wind? Do you curious about those compilable files in package DataBrowse?

When I fix the path-setting errors, I'm attracted by the .dat files in folder "D:\Wind\etc\Bond". Does anybody ever read them? when I copy those data files and use pandas.read_sas('FXmanage.dat'), it reports
unable to infer format of SAS file

What's wrong with it? Maybe the company overestimate their users' network skills and manipulate some traps on file names. But what's wrong with it if one .dat file cannot read using pandas.read_sas but actually it still works?
As it's in my user folder, I think I have the right to disclose my data

My code is:
import pandas as pd
pd.read_sas('FXmanage.dat')

it reports
"unable to infer format of SAS file"
