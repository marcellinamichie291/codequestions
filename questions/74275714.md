# Outlook Button in Ribbon for saving mail (incoming and outgoing) to nominated destination in new folder

I want to create a button in Outlook that saves an incoming mail in a folder named:
"yyyymmdd - {sender's initials} - {email subject}".
Similarly, I need a button for outgoing mail that needs to be saved in a folder named:
"yyyymmdd - {email subject}".
Since I work in a variety of directories, a user input will be required to specify the project number where the relevant mail needs to go, ie:
C:\Users\User.Name{project_name_input}.
I tried some VBA scripts, but I am not good at it. I haven't gotten close to a solution.
