# i cant use hooks in react,advice?

I'm building a react app and when i started with my first hook function I got this error
react-dom.development.js:16227 
        
       Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.

Finally, the .jsx page that I used the usestate.
import React, { useState }from "react";

import Area from "../ReadFolder/geographicMainComponents/areaMainComponent.jsx";
import City from "../ReadFolder/geographicMainComponents/cityMainComponent.jsx";
import Country from "../ReadFolder/geographicMainComponents/countryMainComponent.jsx";
import Neighborhood from "../ReadFolder/geographicMainComponents/neighborhoodMainComponent.jsx";
import Region from "../ReadFolder/geographicMainComponents/regionMainComponent.jsx";
import { default as AreaW} from "../WriteFolder/geographicMainComponents/areaMainComponent.jsx";
import { default as CityW} from "../WriteFolder/geographicMainComponents/cityMainComponent.jsx";
import { default as CountryW} from "../WriteFolder/geographicMainComponents/countryMainComponent.jsx";
import { default as  NeighborhoodW} from "../WriteFolder/geographicMainComponents/neighborhoodMainComponent.jsx";
import { default as  RegionW} from "../WriteFolder/geographicMainComponents/regionMainComponent.jsx";


export function MenuWrapper(type,id,isEdit){
   let [edit,setEdit] = useState(isEdit);
    if(isEdit){
       if(type==='country'){
            return(  
                     <div>
                        <div className={edit ? 'd-block' :'d-none'}><CountryW id={id}/><button onclick={() => setEdit=false}>read</button></div>
                        <div className={edit ? 'd-none' : 'd-block'}><Country id={id} /><button onclick={() => setEdit=true}>edit</button></div>
                     </div>
                     );
       }
    }
}

sorry, this is so long. please note I tried deleting the package_lock,json and node modules. then I tried npm start and even added a --force.that didn't resolve the issue.
For where I called it
import React,{Component} from "react";
import { MenuWrapper } from "./menuWrapper.jsx";
export function MenuList(Items,kind){
    if(Items===null){
        return(<div></div>)
    }
    return(
        <div>
           
                {
                   Items.map((item)=>{
                        return(
                            MenuWrapper(kind,item.id,false)
                        )
                    })
                
                }
            
        </div>
    );
}
