# Connecting SQL Server To Cognos Free Trial Version

I had subscribed for free trial for IBM Cognos. In that I have to connect my SQL server with it. I had tried all alternatives but none is working. According to the error, I had even given access of firewall through my system with port defined, also in sql server configuration manager. But still facing the same error when Testing the connection through ibm cognos.By default, we can only connect through jdbc.
