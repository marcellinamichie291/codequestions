# How to populate rows of Spark dataframe column based with previous row based on a multiple conditions?

Disclaimer: This might be possible duplicate but I cannot find the exact solution. Please feel free to mark this question as duplicate and provide link to duplicate question in comments.
I am still learning python dataframe operations and this possibly has a very simple solution which I am not able to figure out.
I have a spark dataframe around 12 million rows with few columns. Now I want to derive a column from based on the greatest value from two other columns and the derived value of previous row.
Input-




Column A
Column B
Column C
Column D
Column E
Column F
Column G

New Column H needs to be created with following logic

Dataframe is populated with distinct values in column A spread across diff month and year and aligned in ascending order.
First row of each distinct value in Column A must be maximum of Column E and F
Subsequent row value for Column H is maximum of Column E and F and value derived on previous row for column H.(when Column G >=0)
If Column G < 0, Column H is maximum of (Column E and F and (column G + previous row value for column H))
