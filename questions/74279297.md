In google apps script im changing 12 values in a document all using the same function `
    body.replaceText("[name]", row[1]);
    body.replaceText("[dob]", friendlyDate);
    body.replaceText("[email]", row[3]);
    body.replaceText("[phone]", row[4]);
    body.replaceText("[uni]", row[5]);
    body.replaceText("[school]", row[6]);
    body.replaceText("[schooldeg]", row[7]);
    body.replaceText("[language]", row[8]);
    body.replaceText("[exp]", row[9]);
    body.replaceText("[position]", row[10]);
    body.replaceText("[nightlife]", row[11]);
    body.replaceText("[image]", row[13]);

`
but its times out after the 5th one. so i was wondering if i can save and close then reopen after every single one
ive tried to repeat the commands that get me to open the file but it wont work
