# How to print next few lines after regex match until another regex match?

For instance, there is a piece of text
[task,line:111] first
                second
[demo,line:222] first
[test,line:333] first
[task,line:444] first
                second
                third
[task,line:555] first


I only want the lines with [task] and next lines until another [*] appears. Like below
[task,line:111] first
                second
[task,line:444] first
                second
                third
[task,line:555] first

How can I use awk or other tool in shell script to acomplish it?
I just know I can use
awk '/regex/{print $0>"'$output'"}' $file

to get lines with [task] and redirect them to another file.Please help me with this.
