# Translate List into List of Int

I have a json value as below
"BookShops": [
    {
        "Name": "Modern",
        "BookID": [
            "101"
        ]
    },
    {
        "Name": "Windshore",
        "BookID": [
            "102"
        ]
    },
    {
        "Name": "Winter",
        "BookID": [
            "105"
        ]
    },
]

Each of element of bookshops have only one bookID (even their type is int array) I want to move bookID into List Of Int just like the expect result
"GlobalBookID":[101,102,105]

that define in class as
List<int> GlobalBookIDs

Can I know to translate it in single line ?
