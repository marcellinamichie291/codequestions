# how to loop through type array mongodb node.js

I have this code:
if (req.query.limit != undefined || req.query.limit != null) {
  doc = await collection.find().toArray()
  show_all = true
}
        
let purchasedDocuments = await purchasedDocumentsCollection.find(
  {email:req.session.username}).toArray()


//if purchasedDocuments are equal to any of the id's in doc, then pass true flag
let xxxid = 'g81h8'
for (var i = 0; i < purchasedDocuments.length; i++) {
  console.log(purchasedDocuments[i].list_of_docs_bought)
  if (purchasedDocuments[i].list_of_docs_bought == xxxid) {
    console.log(true)
  } else {
    console.log(false)
  }
}

The way my mongodb collection login which holds the list_of_docs_bought data is structured like so:
list_of_docs_bought: array
 0: 'hdouch'
 1: 'vcisjc

and my collection documents (doc) is like so:
id: 'hdouch'
so I need to check if purchasedDocuments are equal to any of the id's in doc, then pass true flag
I tried with the loop
for (var i = 0; i < purchasedDocuments.length; i++) {
      console.log(purchasedDocuments[i].list_of_docs_bought)
      if (purchasedDocuments[i].list_of_docs_bought == xxxid) {

but obviously that didn't work because purchasedDocuments[i].list_of_docs_bought just shows the array, but doesn't loop through it. So how could I fix this?
