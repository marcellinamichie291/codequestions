I have two tables:
The table that I use to create to build my pivot table: That is like that
NAME | COUNTRY | PRODUCT | SALE
Every day I had to download this data and put the data in the table 1
But one day my excel come like this:
PRODUCT | SALE |NAME | COUNTRY |
Another day:
| SALE |NAME |COUNTRY | PRODUCT |
I would like to know a way to put my database always in the same order as table 1.
I am currently doing it by hand. And takes so much time.
