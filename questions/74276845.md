# How to choose to use `flag` or `table` to handle data that needs to remain `unsubmitted`

My data needs a special state saved but not committed
A usage as follows:


User can save/modify personal information, after which he can choose to saved but not submitted data

Then others query the user and find that his user information is blank/not modified

The next time the User wants to save/modify personal information, the saved but not submitted data will be read first

After the User's operation, if he wants his personal information to be used, he needs to submit the data

The system saves the user's submissions and deletes his saved but not committed data

Then others can look up the User's latest personal information



It looks like a historical record, but I just need the most recent
Then how to chose between create a table or add a flag column?
