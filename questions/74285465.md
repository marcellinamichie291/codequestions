# How to test the method of a private property is called in Angular

I have a class which has a private property.
export class SocketService {
 
  private socket: Socket;
 
  public initializeSocket() {
      this.socket = // get a new Socket
      this.socket.on('connect', () => this.processConnect() );
  }
  private processConnect() {
    ...
  }
}

When write unit test for initializeSocket(), how to validate the on is called?
