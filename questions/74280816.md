# Power BI: Create a total column from unrelated data set

I have two HR data sets below; one is data of all employees by department and categories (total population) and the second is the data set of employees that left and their leave reason (departure data).
There is less data in the departure data set and the employee IDs are not always matching it wouldn't make sense to join.
My desired result is the last table below. The blue part is a summary of the departure data. I can do the blue part of the table in PowerBI  but I cannot add the yellow and red part (summary of total employees and leave rate by department and categories). When I try it just put 16 in all rows. Is there a way to do this in PowerBI?
Note: These are hypothetical examples, and my data sets have more rows.
Thanks.



desired result
