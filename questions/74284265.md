# Remove days and date from datetime

I am using pandas datetime for some timeseries data I am using.  But the data I am using only really needs the seconds portion of datetime as I am working with data that is highly temporally detailed and the date is not useful information.  Is there a way to create indices only based on the time in seconds (sampled at 2500Hz) without the date or is that required in datetime?
