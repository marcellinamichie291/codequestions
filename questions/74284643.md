# Call JS Math functions without writing Math.__ every time?

I have some code that uses JavaScriptâ€™s Math functions quite a lot, to the point that Iâ€™d much rather be writing things like exp(cos(PI/2)) instead of Math.exp(Math.cos(Math.PI/2)), which gets ugly and unreadable fast. Even an alias like m. would be clutter. To that extent, I need a simple bit of header code to enumerate over Math and pull its entries into the current scope.

Good news is, standing on the shoulders of Stack Overflow giants, Iâ€™ve built an elegant solution to share with the world!! ðŸ¥³ Here it is:
// Import all Math numbers and functions to the current (global) scope.
for (let name of Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Math))
  this[name] = Math[name]

console.log(  exp(cos(PI/2))  )  // = 1

Iâ€™m very happy with it, posting it here to give back to the community and to see if anyone has improvements! ðŸ’ž It truly just feels so much cleaner now, like how it shouldâ€™ve always been. Math functions deserve to be global!
