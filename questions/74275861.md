# Excel VBA: How to combine multiple Excel files with same layout in a single folder into a single sheet?

So, I want to create an Excel VBA that saves all the attachments of an Outlook folder to the single Excel file (all the files will have the same layout but different data) and then combine the Excel files in that folder into the active worksheet.
I've already succeeded to save all attachments into one folder. However, I've failed to combine these files into one sheet. Can you help with that?
Thank you very much
I have tried several things for the second part of my problem but it didn't work. Here is the first part of my code:
Option Explicit

Sub IKDISKETI()

Dim ol As Outlook.Application
Dim ns As Outlook.Namespace
Dim fol As Outlook.Folder
Dim i As Object
Dim mi As Outlook.MailItem
Dim at As Outlook.Attachment

Set ol = New Outlook.Application
Set ns = ol.GetNamespace("MAPI")
Set fol = ns.Folders(1).Folders("IKDISKET")

For Each i In fol.Items

If i.Class = olMail Then

Set mi = i

If mi.Attachments.Count > 0 Then

Debug.Print mi.SenderName, mi.ReceivedTime, mi.Attachments.Count

For Each at In mi.Attachments

Debug.Print vbTab, at.DisplayName, at.Size
at.SaveAsFile "C:\IKDISKET\" & at.Filename

Next at

End If

End If

Next i

End Sub

Option Explicit
