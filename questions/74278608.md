# React Native - Dynamic link not persisting through install process

I have a small React Native app for which I have a series of Firebase dynamic links. When the app is installed, the links work perfectly in directing users to the relevant screen defined in the dynamic link
However, if the user does not have the app installed when the dynamic link is followed, the route defined in the dynamic link does not persist.
Is it possible to persist the deep link during the installation process?
I've tried a basic deep link URL like https://fakedomain.org/upload as well as using the ?link=https://fakedomain.org/upload param and neither seem to work.
