# How to pass the results of the search screen to the detail screen that launches in a separate window

We are creating a web screen that searches a DB table and displays the results in a table format.
It is assumed that there is a list data screen that displays the search results, and when the "detail button" is clicked on the list data screen, the detail screen is displayed in a separate window.
In the detail screen, the Next button displays the next record on the table of the list data screen, and the Previous button displays the previous record.
Previous button displays the previous record.

In the above, what kind of implementation method is possible to pass the result of the list data screen to the detail screen in a separate window?
The method I'm thinking of is to temporarily save the search results as a CSV file on the web server for each client, and search the CSV file when the Next button is pressed.
