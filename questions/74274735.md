# Ruby Rails get records where a record doesn't already exist of a particular status

I have a Item model (:name, :desc, ...) and a Price model (:item_id, :status, ...).
Item has many Prices & a Price belongs to an item.
I need to select all Items which have no Price or have no price with a :status of 'active'.
So if an Item has multiple prices but one is 'active' then I do not want to include it.
Thank you.
Item.includes(:prices).where(prices: {item_id: nil}).or(Item.includes(:prices).where.not(prices: {status: 'active'}))

Is the best I could come up with...
