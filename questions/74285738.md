# Display array elements with next and prev button using ReactJS

I have an array which contains 10 objects, called emailThreads.
I am trying to display these objects with next and previous button but its not working as expected.
      <Controls>
        <Button onClick={previousEmail}>Previous Email</Button>
        <SubjectDetails>
          <Subject>SUBJECT</Subject>
          <SubjectTitle>{emailThreads[emailIndex].subject}</SubjectTitle>
          <SentAtDetails>Sent At {emailThreads[emailIndex].deliveredAt}</SentAtDetails>
        </SubjectDetails>
        <Button onClick={nextEmail}>Next Email</Button>
      </Controls>

this is code for previousEmail and nextEmail
  const [emailIndex, setEmailIndex] = useState(0);
  const previousEmail = () => {
    setEmailIndex((prevIndex) => {
      prevIndex !== 0 ? prevIndex - 1 : prevIndex;
    });
  };
  const nextEmail = () => {
    setEmailIndex((prevIndex) => {
      prevIndex !== emailThreads.length ? prevIndex + 1 : prevIndex;
    });
  };

when I click on the next email,
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'subject')

any help would be wonderful, thank you
