# Unable to open chromium browser in VPS with Selenium

I need to open chromium or chrome with selenium in Ubuntu 22 deployed in Digital Ocean VPS droplet. The issue is it doesnt open a chrome tab, the chromium and chromedriver are same version.This works fine in my localhost, with ubuntu 22.However, I was not able to run it when deployed in vps
  options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
  options.add_extension(pluginfile)
  driver = webdriver.Chrome('chromedriver', options=options)

I tried several things including the suggestions here Selenium: WebDriverException:Chrome failed to start: crashed as google-chrome is no longer running so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed
The error is
 (unknown error: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist)
 (The process started from chrome location /snap/bin/chromium is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.)

As I already mentioned, this will work perfectly fine in localhost with same OS and chromedriver and chromium version.
Any idea how to make it work in a VPS?
