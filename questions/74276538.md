# How to autowire an object passing application properties with Spring Boot?

I have a class like this:
@Component
public class KafkaConsumer {

    ...

    @KafkaListener(id = "${my-id}", topics = "${my-topics}")
    public void receive(String myMessage) {
        ...
    }
...
}

and I want to reuse it as it is but changing id and topics params. These params should come from the application.yml, in this way:
consumer1:
   id: id1
   topics: topic1

consumer2:
   id: id2
   topics: topic2


and from another service doing something like:
@Service
class MyService {

   
   @Autowired(my-id="{consumer1.id}", my-topics="{consumer1.topics}")
   KafkaConsumer consumer1;

   @Autowired(my-id="{consumer2.id}", my-topics="{consumer2.topics}")
   KafkaConsumer consumer2;

...

}

what is the closest way to do that?
