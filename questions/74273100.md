# I'm trying to create a vertical number line with text on the side and number in the middle

for a frontend project, I'm being asked to create a startup page but there's a particular section that I just can't seem to get, and that is the image 
I'm creating the project using react.js and tailwind CSS but any ** CSS answer will do ** I have spent days on it trying to use grid and flexbox.
I'm hoping for a mobile responsive solution that won't break on different devices. the above image is a small screen view and it's going to be a column(vertical) always
I also tried just copying the image but that felt wrong and it made the text on the image uncopyable also I might want to add an anchor tag to the numbers in the future
