# Drupal 9: How to get SEO-friendly url for custom content type?

I've installed Drupal 9 on my workstation. I have created my own Content Type, let's call it Event. I want to configure Drupal so that all nodes of this custom Content Type are available at the url example.com/event/[node:title].
Is this possible with the Drupal 9 core modules? Or must I install something like pathauto as described here? I find it hard to believe Drupal 9 wouldn't have some way to get SEO-friendly urls like this.
