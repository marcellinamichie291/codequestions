# Show soft keyboard react native with Bluetooth barcode device connected

I am developing a react native app in Android and I can't achieve he behaviour of open the soft keboard in my app while a device bluetooth device (barcode scanner) is connected. My app is a Point of Sale and the problem is that sometimes is better find a product by typing it because de barcode is unreadable.
I am try a lot of thing, but I am not sure if is really possible to achieve this behaviour.
