# Ads events from Admob to BigQuery

I use ads in my app using Google Admob. My goal is to make deep analysis on my app. I linked my app with Firebase and Google Analytics. Also I connected Firebase with Admob and link Firebase to BigQuery. But I can't see full events from Admob in BigQuery. Parameters I want to see per event is at least user_id, screen_name and ad_id. It would be great if I also will see how much money I receive from every ad shown. I know that this data is shown in Firebase and Google Analytics, but it shown in very general way, my goal is to investiagete it deeper.
Thanks!
