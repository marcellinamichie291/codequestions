# Find maximum intersection value in the array

Can anyone please help me with a question.
There's a list with startTime, endTime, value. There will be overlapping ranges. I need to return the maximum value possible. How to do that?
Example: lst = [[1,10,5], [2,3,2], [5,9,6], [8,12,5]] should return 16
Thanks you!
Tried to find the intersection but doesn't work
