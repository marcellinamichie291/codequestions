# Comparing two columns in two different dataframe and replacing values missing

I have a project on R as I am learning it, but I am totally lost about this problem : I have two dataframes (crime2020 and crime2021) but in crime2021, the column Primary.Type is missing. Each possible value of Primary.Type is linked with a particular "ID" corresponding to the value in the column IUCR.
The idea is as follow : as I have IUCR in both dataframes, I want to compare the IUCR of 2020 and 2021, and when there are equal, I want to put the value of Primary.Type in 2021 in the dataframe of 2020.
I don't think it is clear so I will give a simple example :
Dataframe 2020 :




IUCR
Primary.Type




0820
NA


0460
NA




Dataframe 2021 :




IUCR
Primary.Type




0820
Theft


0789
Robbery


0460
Battery




So here, for the first column of 2020, where IUCR=0820, I want to test if a IUCR in 2021 is equal to 0820 and if yes, replace with the value in Primary.Type for this row, so Theft should be put in the first row of the colum Primary.Type of 2020. And I want to do it for each row of 2020.
So I want to compare each row of 2020 with each row of 2021. The problem is that both dataframes have 200.000 rows...
I tried first for just the first row (i=1) of my 2020 dataframe with the function that follows :
Create<-function(i){
  for(y in 1:nrow(crime2021)){
    ifelse(crime2020[i,5]==crime2021[y,5],
           crime2020[i,22]<-crime2021[y,6],
           (for(x in 1:(nrow(crime2021)-y)){
           ifelse(crime2020[i,5]==crime2021[y+x,5], crime2020[i,22]<-crime2021[y+x,5], crime2020[i,22]<-"NA")}
             ))}}

with :

crime2020[i,5] = IUCR 2020
crime2021[y,5] = IUCR 2021
crime2020[i,22] = Primary.Type 2020
crime2020[y,6] = Primary.Type 2021

I don't know if it works because this function is too "heavy" so when I ran Create(1) it takes too long to and I had to stop it.
If someone have a solution it will really helps me !
Thanks you, and don't hesitate to ask for precisions, I don't know if it is very clear !
