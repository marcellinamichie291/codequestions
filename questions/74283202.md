# Front end pagination strategy React

What is the way to applying pagination strategy with front end on react, to load data on scrolling from a local JSON file?
I have a local JSON file, it's about 4 million line.
This is JSON structure:
{
 "name": "...",
 "type": "personal_chat",
 "id": 1744378997,
 "messages": [

  //some data here

 ]
}

I want to make a static chat; Purpose just display static chat for a user
As I said that a file is about 4,400,000 line and 300,000 object in messages array.
I asked before and they told me to use pagination strategy
How I can make it with front end only to simply put a data from messages array as:
import React from "react";
import msgs from "./result.json" assert {type : 'json'} 
function App(){
const {messages} = msgs
   return (
     <div className="msg-cont">
       //Code here
     </div>
)
}
