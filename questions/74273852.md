# How to define a generic function to derive multiple new columns from a given column name?

I have been trying to derive two columns from a given column name through a python function.  Below is the code snippet:
from pyspark.sql.functions import substring

def deriveCol(source_col_name, col1, col2):
    df.select(source_col_name, substring(source_col_name, 1, 4).alias(col1), substring(source_col_name, 5, 2).alias(col2))
    for i in col2:
        if i >= "01" and i <= "03":
            print("First quarter")
        elif i >= "04" and i <= "06":
            print("second quarter")
        elif i >= "06" and i <= "09":
            print("Third quarter")
        else:
            print("Fourth quarter")
    return df.select([col1, col2]).show(10, truncate=True)
 
t = deriveCol("Report", "year", "month")

Please see the below output
Fourth quarter
Fourth quarter
+----+-----+
|year|month|
+----+-----+
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
|2022|   01|
+----+-----+
only showing top 10 rows

"Report' = the source column from where data has to be derived from.
"year"/"month" = derived column.
I have a column coming for a database table, and I have to split it into 3 parts: "year", "month", "quarter".
The "year" and "month" were easy. But finding the "quarter" is not working. When executing the code, it's directly going to else and printing "fourth quarter". But I can say that the "month" which I have derived above with the help of substring() function also has dates coming from all months of a given year.
Note: I need to save the output of the "quarter" in a separate column.
