# Am suppose to make a bowling score app and i got this so far what do i do next?

Here is the question but I don't know how to move on from there:
Create a BowlingScores application that prompts the user to enter as many bowling scores as desired and then displays the high and low scores for the total number of times played. You should include a score and the full results of all ten frames.
The application interface should provide Input for users to enter scores, and the results statistics should be displayed when completed. When the user enters a specific flag, the application will stop accepting inputs and calculate the total, high and low scores.
Global Variables
High
Low
Counter
Total
Local Variables
FLAG
score
tempscore
Score = int(tempscore)
Code Hint Examples
While score <> FLAG:
If score > high And score <> FLAG :
                     High = score

import math
game1=int(input("Please enter your FIRST bowling score:"))
game2=int(input("Please enter your SECOND bowling score:"))
game3=int(input("Please enter your THIRD bowling score:"))
score=(game1+game2+game3)
score_list=[game1,game2,game3]
counter=0
high_score=max(score_list)
low_score=min(score_list)
total_score=0
average=(high_score+low_score)/2

if score==300:
    print('Wow. You have won the game with max points!')
    print('Your highest score is:',high_score)
    print('Your lowest score is:',low_score)
