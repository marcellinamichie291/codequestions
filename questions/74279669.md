# kube-ipvs0 is using first master IP

I have a cluster with 2 masters provisioned by kubespray
It was working fine first, then the first master etcd wasn't able to connect to other etcd with error no route to host, digging deeper I found that interface kube-ipvs0 is using first master IP, as soon as I remove it from there I can telnet from the first master, but It gets re-added, I tried adding it to the kube-proxy cm and restarting the pods but it's still there
    ipvs:
      excludeCIDRs: [10.xxx.xxx.87/32, 10.xxx.xxx.88/32]
      minSyncPeriod: 0s
      scheduler: rr
      strictARP: false
      syncPeriod: 30s
      tcpFinTimeout: 0s
      tcpTimeout: 0s
      udpTimeout: 0s
    ```
