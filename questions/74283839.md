# Can't deploy Docker container to Azure registry from VSCode

I'm trying to follow the steps in this tutorial: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/deploy-visual-studio-code
I've got the plugins setup in VSCode and the sample code cloned to my machine. However, when I right-click on the Dockerfile and select "Build Image in Azure", I'm unable to get it to complete. There's no error, the deployment just seemingly hangs, this is the only output I get:
The Docker extension will try to connect to 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock', via context 'default'.

And it just stays at that final step infinitely, and the image never shows up in the Azure docker registry I specified.
What I tried:
Deploying the docker image to azure
What I expected:
It to successfully deploy
What happened:
It's stuck on Step 1/10 with no error message or obvious way to proceed
