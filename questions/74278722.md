# Put 2 JS Files Into 1 JS File

I have 2 JS files on my website
• darkmode.js
https://github.com/BayuAngora/BayuAngora/blob/main/darkmode.js
• worker.js
https://github.com/BayuAngora/BayuAngora/blob/main/worker.js
How to put exactly those 2 JS files into 1 JS file without getting warning and error?
Regards
