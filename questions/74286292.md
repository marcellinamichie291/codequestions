# How to Queue the multiple API requests at same time in FastAPI with Gunicorn

How can I queue the multiple API request in FastAPI.
For example if there is an API which takes 10 seconds to complete the request and there are 10 API requests at same time then how can We handle that part.
If anyone can help on this then it would be a great help
Thanks
I tried to use the selenium using fastAPI and Gunicorn and its working fine if there one request at a time but if I will do multiple request the selemium generate error.
So I'm trying to find a solution like queue processing in FastAPI.
