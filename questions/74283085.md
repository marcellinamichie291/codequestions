Im changing my bios configuration every time I boot into kali Linux, is it safe to do it like this (or) there is any other possible ways?
I can't find any other possible options. Can any one tell there is any other possible solutions as every time changing the bios configuration and hectic work and I am getting a feeling that my windows may get corrupted.
