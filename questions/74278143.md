# Expecting delimiter in .bin file

I'm currently working with several .bin files generated by an oscilloscopes' software. These .bin files consist of header and 1.5k points on the screen. A part of a program I wrote to work with those .bin files extracts header and converts it to JSON format. With this .bin file https://dropmefiles.com/6C2qr my program works excellent, however, with this file https://dropmefiles.com/ocM9H program returns this message:

Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 820 (char 819)

I tried looking through both bins with hexdump command but found no difference. What could be a problem and how should I correct it?
My code(Python) for extracting JSON:
def HeaderToJSON(file):
    start = file.read(10) 
    print(start)
            
    chID = bytes()
    count = 0
    while True:       
        s = file.read(1)
        chID += s
        if s == b'}':
            count += 1
            if count == 6:
                break
    
    noise2 = f.read(4)
