# Looking for a tool/script for adding duration of video into the Video file name

I know I can see the length right there in the windows explorer.. But I am told the video files must have the duration/length of each file into its name so looking for some tool that will make my life easier.
I need to do this fast and repeat the process daily. I need something that just adds the duration to the end of the filename.
I tried "bulk rename utility" I don't think it has the options for what I am looking for.
Sample of what I am looking for (Did this manually)
I have a folder with some files like this

I need them to be Renamed like like this or in similar fashion
