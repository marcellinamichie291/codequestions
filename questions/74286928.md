# How do I fix elementor section?

I got a big problem... I am using drawattention and everything was fine untill suddenly the sections are broken, I believe it got something to do with elementor...
When I enter the elementor editor, it looks great and then on preview its broken.
And when u go to inspect page it gets fixed.
How do I fix this?
