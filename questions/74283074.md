# is it possible to use Amazon Forecast without Amazon S3?

I am learning the Forecast tool and would like to know if it is possible to use Forecast without S3?
Send the data directly to forecast without going through the s3 bucket.
If possible, could you give me an example?
thanks!
All the information I have read says that it is necessary to use the amazon S3 bucket, but I do not lose anything by asking if it is possible to avoid that step.
