# How to find migration guide for firebase-functions v4

The console informed me yesterday that I should update firebase-functions to v4, we've been on v3.21.2. It also informed me that there would be breaking changes.
All I can find it this: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions/releases/tag/v4.0.0, but it'd be great to find a real migration guide? For now I guess I'll search functions wide for the things that are included in that changelog.
