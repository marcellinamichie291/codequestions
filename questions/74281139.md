# I can't drop and re-create a temp table in Redshift?

I am using temp tables in Amazon Redshift, using Python 3.9 and the redshift connector in JupyterLab. I have found that when I create a temp table, and then I drop it, I am unable to re-create it without restarting the kernel.
For example, I create a temp table #foo:
cursor.execute("select 1 as ColA into #foo union all select 2 union all select 3;")
cursor.execute("select * from #foo;").fetch_dataframe()

This works.
If I want to make some change to #foo as I'm developing code, I drop it and re-write it (something that always works for me in native SQL Server):
cursor.execute("drop table #foo;")
cursor.execute("select 1 as ColA into #foo union all select 2 union all select 3;")

I am able to create the table, but when I try to access this table:
cursor.execute("select * from #foo;").fetch_dataframe()
I get the following error:
ProgrammingError: {'S': 'ERROR', 'C': 'XX000', 'M': 'could not open relation with OID 2956949', 'F': '../src/pg/src/backend/access/heap/heapam.c', 'L': '620', 'R': 'local_relation_open'}

I've tried dropping the table and using CASCADE as well, but nothing works except restarting the kernel. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can drop and re-create temp tables like this?
Thank you!
