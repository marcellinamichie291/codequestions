# Linking separate texts, titles and pictures with each other and randomly show on click, flutter/dart

I'm new here, but anyways, for a school project we gotta link separate texts, titles and pictures with each other and randomly show them on click (on a button). The idea was to add multiple images of cats and add a certain text and title and when clicking on a button the images should be randomly changed and the associated text and title should appear with it too, i hope u guys understand what i mean..
Now the thing is, I've no idea how to do this. I do know how to do this with images only, but idk how to add text to it too.. I tried searching on google too but couldn't really find anything useful, I also tried asking our teacher but I kept forgetting so this place was my only hope tbh.
The code where it only works with images is this:
import 'dart:math';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const DicePage());
}

class DicePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const DicePage({super.key});

  @override
  State<DicePage> createState() => DicePageState();
}

class DicePageState extends State<DicePage> {
  int leftDice = 1;
  int rightDice = 1;

  void changeDiceFace() {
    setState(() {
      leftDice = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
      rightDice = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.red,
        appBar: AppBar(
          elevation: 0,
          backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          centerTitle: true,
          title: Text('Dicee'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Expanded(
                child: TextButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    changeDiceFace();
                  },
                  child: Image.asset('images/dice$leftDice.png'),
                ),
              ),
              Expanded(
                child: TextButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    changeDiceFace();
                  },
                  child: Image.asset('images/dice$rightDice.png'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Anybody any ideas? Thanks so much in advance!!
