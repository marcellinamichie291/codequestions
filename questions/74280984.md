# Firebase app distribution for iOS - certificate expired

I am distributing the iOS version of a flutter app via firebase for testing. The first version worked fine. Now, a few months later I tried distributing a new version but testers can't install the app.
Apparently the firebase app distribution signing certificate (appdistribution.firebase.dev) is expired. I don't know where the firebase certificate comes from, probably because I lack understanding of the basics of all things iOS and firebase and what not. My apple certificates (Provisioning Profile) are all far from expiring and I don't know where the firebase certificate even comes/what it means from. What do I need to do to fix this?
Thank you
