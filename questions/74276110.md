# How do you make an Offset swinging oval or cam please?

If you make a shape in Python, say an oval, and make it rotate? Instead of rotating from it's center how do you make it rotate from a quarter in from the right, or from the right side for example?
ovi = turtle.Turtle()
ovi.speed(0)
ovi.penup()
ovi.goto(0, 0)
ovi.color("blue")
ovi.shape("circle")
ovi.shapesize(stretch_wid=2.5, stretch_len=5)

sw1 = 1
while sw1 > 0:
    ovi.right(15)

This will make an oval rotate right, infanitely from it's center a point 0. 0. My question is how do you make the oval rotate from it;s own side or a different position of the oval itself, not the grid please?
I've used the code I've just written but I can't make the oval spin on a differen axis like, or make a cam for example?
