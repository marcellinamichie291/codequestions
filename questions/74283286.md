I would like to programmatically use stockfish.js from https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js/.
On the web site it says:

You will need to run the example/server.js server to view the
client-side examples.

How do I run example/server.js ?
What I did:

In the 'stockfish.js\example' folder I run node example/server.js
I open it in a browser with the url http://127.0.0.1:8080/ it shows the GUI but displays at the bottom:  "Engine: loading..." and doesn't finish. 
When I look at the inspector it shows:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.' at :8080/stockfish.js:1
If I click on ":8080/stockfish.js:1" it shows: ../src/stockfish.js
