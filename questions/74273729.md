# I'm having a positioning problem in instagram story clone

I've finished most things, but when I put a photo, its position is in ridiculous places. I created a new div inside main it has a photo class. But there is a problem with my positioning. Main stays at the top and a photo comes out from where the main ends at the bottom.


body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  position: relative;
}

.main {
  background-color: grey;
  position: relative;
}

.photo {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: -1;
}
.header {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  padding-top: 15pt;
  padding-left: 10pt;
  padding-right: 10pt;
}

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  z-index: 2;
}
<body>
    <div class="main">
      <div class="photo"><img src="assets/Artboard 9.png" alt="" /></div>
      <div class="header">
        <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="flex-container-item active"></div>
          <div class="flex-container-item active"></div>
