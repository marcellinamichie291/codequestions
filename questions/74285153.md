# Spring Data MongoDB Repository with dynamic collection name on every request

We are fecthing the data from Mongo db usinf spring data reactive repository.
The collection name is dynamic which comes in the request.
So we need to set it on every request and fetch the data from that collection.
@Document(collection = "<fetched from request>")
public class SomeModelBean {
...

For every request collection name is different retrieved from the request.
Is there a way to achieve this.
