# NodeJS firebase-admin cannot send email verification link

I'm using node firebase-admin to manage user as follow.
function (req, res, next) {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const auth = getAuth();
  const userRecord = await auth.createUser({ email, password });
  auth.generateEmailVerificationLink(email).then(console.log);
  // this log verify link successfully xyz.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action?mode=verifyEmail&oobCode=...
  await accountService.createAccount({ id: userRecord.uid, email })
  res.status(200).json(userRecord);
}

I also tried different email and also debug auth.generateEmailVerificationLink function and saw it invoked to firebase auth api and succeed. But cannot find email in mail box or spam.
