# How can I get a speeding profile using Here Maps Route Matching API?

We are using Here MapsRoute Matching API (https://developer.here.com/documentation/route-matching/dev_guide/index.html) to calculate the most sensible route based on many trace points.
We use the POST endpoint and we pass the tracepoints in GeoJSON format, including coordinates, timestamp and speed value for each point.
We would like to get the (estimated) speed of the vehicle in each of the links along the route.
This is an example of our request to the API:
https://routematching.hereapi.com/v8/calculateroute.json?routeMatch=1&mode=fastest;truck;traffic:disabled&routeAttributes=mo,wp,sm,fl,sp,sc&drivingReport=1&apiKey=whatever&alignToGpsTime=0&legAttributes=mn&linkAttributes=ma
We tried to use the remaining time and remaining distance attributes of each link to calculate the speed on each link, but the results dont correlate with the original trace points.
Is this the right approach to calculate a speeding profile of a route?
