# `setup.py develop` works but `pip install -e` doesn't - TypeError: 'module' object is not callable

Setuptools deprecated develop in favor of -e, yet former works for me while latter gives
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable

for MyClass() that comes from from my_pkg import MyClass, with __init__.py being
from .submodule import MyClass

All I found is a bunch of closed and stale issues that point to this issue.

This problem is not consistently reproducible: copying all files and just renaming the library can be a fix, or (though I can no longer reproduce) reinstalling.
This problem was reproducible via plain terminal python, but now it's only reproducible via pytest tests/ and inside of test_example() that's inside of tests/test_stuff.py. If I just put MyClass() outside of test_example(), it doesn't fail...
I'm using an Anaconda virtual environment with a mix of pip and conda installs that otherwise works fine.
I'm using pyproject.toml with requires, and a rather basic setuptools.setup
warnings.warn(MyClass) gives <module 'my_pkg.MyClass' from '../my_pkg/MyClass/__init__.py'>; this file doesn't exist.

Is this a known issue with known possible causes? Unsure how to debug it as I can't even reproduce it in a near-clone. I've tried
conda clean --all
pip cache remove *
pip cache purge

Python 3.10.4, Windows 10, setuptools 65.5.0, pytest 7.2.0.
