# How to get current value of oracle sequence in ctl template

I'm trying to ingest 3 csv into 3 three tables A,B,C respectively. Primary key of A is generated using SCHEMEA.SEQ_TAB_REC_ID.NEXTVAL  and B, C has foreign key column which is referring to A's primary key
I tried to put the direct sql query
select SEQ_TAB_REC_ID.CURRVAL FROM dual;

in the ctl. But it does not work Then I tried to put it like this
TAB_REC_ID  "TAB_STG.SEQ_TAB_REC_ID.CURRVAL",
It would be greatly appreciated if you could come up with a solution for getting the current value of sequence in the ctl either using the raw sql or by an expression inside the ctl template
