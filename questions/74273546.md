# How to disable XOFF and XON in ubuntu_20.04 with i3-wm?


OS: Ubuntu 20.04 focal
machine: virtualbox (virtual machine) x86-64
DE: no desktop environment
WM: i3-wm
shell: GNU bash 5.0.17
My question is:
I want the ^S and ^Q available for programs like vim, and I don't want ^S freezing up my display.
What I've tried:
I found other people solved this problem by append stty -ixon to ~/.bashrc, so I follwed.
However I find an error prompt showing up as I relogin. Then I can login to my i3-wm.
Besides:
What is tty ? What is the program stty used for ? I can't understand it's man-page :)
Does stty can solve my problem ?

Thanks for anybody's help !
