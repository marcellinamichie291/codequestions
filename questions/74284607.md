# How to integrate a compiler into my Spring Boot Application

I am building a spring boot application that streamlines the processes required for QA Testing.
One of the requirements for the application is an execute button within it. So I need some resources on how to go about implementing something like that. For now i just want to execute a maven project and not have any debug features.
At first I was thinking of using the JavaCompiler interface but it will only help me with single classes and I want the execute button to run a whole project (For eg a different springboot project while my application is running)
