# SQL Query to get the Average age from multiple 'date' values

I'm needing to get a SQL Query which returns the average age of multiple data inputs in my table
Households




User
Dates




1
2002-01-01


2
2004-06-10




I want to grab both User 1 and 2 date of births and return the average age of them.
Managed to get the age from the date of births using
SELECT *, DATE_FORMAT(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(NOW(), Date)), '%Y') + 0 AS age
FROM Households;

I just can't get the rest of it working to then average the ages out.
