# Is there a way in VSCode remote to confirm before auto download-on-click in explorer's file list?

In remote-ssh projects, there may be some large binary files (e.g., model.onnx). Currently if you click them by accident, VSCode will start to download them without confirmation, and you can never cancel the downloading.
Is there a way to confirm before downloading large files? Or is there a config to decide what are binary files that should not be auto-downloaded?
Need a way to prevent downloading large files
