# character level language model belongs to one to many or many to many?

a basic character level language model:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html
do you think it is one to many or many to many ? why?
I feel tricky that it looks like many to many during training, but one to many during test.
