# Do Maps SDK for Android needs a billing enabled api key?

I have a BILLING NOT ENABLED project. and have a api key with that... i'm using this api key in my android project to render maps with MapView. But it seems in the documentation, it is mentioned that maps sdk for android needs a billing enabled api key... but in my case it is working fine without billing enabled... i'm i doing something wrong? or it will break when go to production?
