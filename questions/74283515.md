# Prometheus cluster resource usage excluding master node

I'm currently trying to get an idea of cluster k8s cluster usage with prometheus. We have a master that runs critical services. For the sake of the resource usage, I would like to exclude the master. We will often see clusters at 80% CPU/mem usage but with lots of pending pods because all worker nodes are full and master nodes are tainted.
Using mem as an example, I have the following query to get the cluster usage:
1 - sum(avg_over_time(node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{container="node-exporter"}[10m]))
/ sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)

I know what the master node instance label is with the following query:
$ leader_election_master_status{name="kube-scheduler"}

leader_election_master_status{endpoint="http-metrics", instance="172.20.62.250:10251", [...]}

I would like to query from the sums of node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes and node_memory_MemTotal_bytes that don't match the label instance="172.20.62.250:10251".
How can I do this?
