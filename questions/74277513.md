# Having error in loading localhost page while working with spring boot

I am a newbie to web development, and I have started to learn the backend. I chose Java in the backend, so I started learning spring boot. I used IntelliJ ide. When I ran my first code, I got connected to port 8080. But when I opened the localhost:8080 page in the web browser, it shows a sign-in page or some other pages. But in some tutorials I followed, they were able to modify the localhost:8080 page. And even tried to change the port, like 8090, it opens the same sign-in page. enter image description here
Can anyone help me to solve this problem?
I expected that the localhost page will open, and I will be able to modify that page by modifying the code. But whaenter image description heret actually happened was, i was not able to access the page.
