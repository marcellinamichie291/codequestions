# Sending formdata from React to express using multer

This is a MERN app that has a form consisting of text inputs and a file input. The problem: I am unable to access the file input in my backend.
Start of controller function:
async function create(req, res) {
    function base64_encode(file) {
        let bitmap = fs.readFileSync(file)
        return bitmap.toString('base64')
    }

    console.log(req.file)

    let image = base64_encode(req.file.path)

The console.log of req.file returns "undefined" and I get error message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')" referring to req.file.path.
The route:
const multer = require("multer")
const upload = multer({ dest: '../../uploads/'})

router.post("/", upload.single('image'), spotCtrl.create)

It should be noted that the image file is not showing up in the image folder I created.
The handleSubmit function:
handleSubmit = async () => {
    let chosenImage = this.state.image
    const formdata = new FormData()
    formdata.append('image', chosenImage)
    let body = {
        name: this.state.name,
        description: this.state.description,
        address: this.state.address
    }
    let options = {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
        formdata: formdata
    }
        
    await fetch("/api", options)
        .then(res => res.json())
    }

The <form tag has encType="multipart/form" set as well.
I've installed multer, fs, express-fileupload, among others
A couple maybe relevant lines from my server.js:
app.use(express.json(), expressfileupload());

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

I have tried in my controller function to use req.files instead of req.file however I get the same result.
