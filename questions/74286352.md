# Publish only one parent crate on multi-crate project

I am creating a library, that is nearly close to its first release, so I would like to upload it to crates.io. Library has a multi-crate design, so I ended with something like:
- CrateA
- CrateProcMacros
- CrateC
- CrateD
- CrateE
- CrateF
- Cargo.toml (handles the workspace)
- Cargo.lock
...

where CrateA is the parent of the other crates, and has dependencies on another of those local crates, and some of those crates also depends on another ones. I mean, it's the primary crate of the library, the one responsible for exposing the public API of the project, and the unique one that I would like to be published in crates.io.
Reading the cargo docs I am seeing that I won't be able to publish a unique crate to the registry. All will be uploaded and published.
So, what alternatives I have to only publish my CrateA to the registry? Should I change my project's structure, and move to CrateA all the other packages and then try to publish it? Or there's some way to achieve this?
