# How to use class in another class in this same folder using PHP?

I have a folder test. In this folder I have a two classes, TestHeader and TestHeaders.
This is TestHeader class
<?php

class TestHeader
{
    public function send(): void
    {
    }
}

This is TestHeaders class
<?php

class TestHeaders
{
    public function profile(int $userId): TestHeader
    {
        return new TestHeader();
    }
}

And when I run tests, show me error Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "TestHeader" not found in C:\project\test\TestHeaders.php:7 I don't know why show this error. Someone could me explain why this error is and how I can fix it ?
