# docker-sync not working after update to macOS Ventura

I updated to new macOS Ventura and docker-sync stoped working. When I run docker-sync sync it is synchronized but docker-sync start doesn't sync it automatically but before update it worked just fine.
I tried update Docker, docker-sync, unison but nothing helped.
Can you help me please?
Best regards
