# how to collect rows with the same index label from different dataframes into one dataframe with row name

I hope I have formulated my question well,
I have a group of statistic files for different subjects in a trial, in separate folders, named with subject id's.
for example:
folder1: 100206
folder2: 100207
folder3: 200208

in each folder, there is a subjectid_all_tracts.csv file
folder1: 100206_all_tracts.csv
folder2: 100207_all_tracts.csv
folder3: 200208_all_tracts.csv

in every all_tracts.csv file, I have around 90 rows (not exactly 90, in some subjects its 89, in some 88) and exactly 30 columns.
What I would like to do is to iterate on each folder, extract the information on row1, and write it to a new csv, named as row1.csv, with new rows being subjects numbers as:
100206_all_tracts.csv:
       stat1 stat2 stat3
row1     1     2     3
row2     1     2     3
row3     1     2     3

row1.csv:
       stat1 stat2 stat3
100206   1     2     3    #row1 from 100206_all_tracts.csv
100207   1     2     3    #row1 from 100207_all_tracts.csv
100208   1     2     3    #row1 from 100208_all_tracts.csv

and here is the current code that I am trying to use:
for dir in os.listdir(rootdir):
    path=rootdir+"\\"+dir
    os.chdir(path)
    all_tracts=glob.glob("*_all_tracts.csv")[0]
    df=pd.read_csv(all_tracts, index_col=0)
    #if tract_name not in df.index:
    #   df_temp=pd.DataFrame()
    #   df = df.append(pd.Series(, index=df.columns[:len(new)]), ignore_index=True)

    for tract_name in tract_names:
        try:
            df=df.loc[[tract_name]]
            tract_name_df=pd.concat([tract_name_df,df], axis=0)
            
        except KeyError:
            pass
