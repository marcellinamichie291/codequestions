# Haskell: add multiple things to a list

I have an assigment and im kinda stuck:
xs = [4, 1]
ys = [3, 2]

the goal is to create a list [1, 2, 3, 4]
I am allowed to use the following commands:
head, tail, ++, !!, reverse, take, drop, init
I know that tail xs ++ (reverse ys) results in [1, 2, 3]
but how do i get the 4 at the end?
My "solution" would have been something along the lines of:
zs = tail xs ++ (reverse ys +++ (head xs)
zs = [1, 2, 3, 4]

but instead im getting the following error:
<interactive>:39:1: error:
    * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num [a]
      (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
    * When checking the inferred type
        it :: forall a. (Num a, Num [a]) => [a]

The problem is i have no clue what that means
It would be nice if someone could explain me how the brackets work in haskell and how i can solve the problem.
