Below is part of my HTML code
    <i (click)="sFlag = true"></i>
    <span *ngIf="sFlag">
        <p-multiSelect [options]="dTypes" [overlayVisible]="true"></p-multiSelect>
    </span>

Here, I am trying to use a property called overlayVisible on my multiselect which will open the options by default. <i> is a filter icon, which on clicking the span will show. But this is not working if my parent span element is having *ngIf directive. If I try by moving my p-multiSelect out of span, then the overlayVisible is working fine. What wrong I am doing here? Please suggest. Thanks.
Below is the stackblitz demo of the issue
