# Strange behaviour of copyto when copying from Windows host to Linux guest

I'm writing some scripts on Windows 10 to automate the creation of Linux (Debian 11) VMs with VirtualBox 7.0.2. It all came along well - up to the point when I started to try copying some files over to the guest with guestcontrol ... copyto:
SET COMMON_OPTS=--username=root --password=changeme --verbose
VBoxManage.exe guestcontrol debian11 copyto %COMMON_OPTS% test.txt /root

This ostensibly works:
Creating guest session as user 'root'...
Waiting for guest session to start...
Successfully started guest session (ID 1)
Copying from host to guest ...
File 'C:\kb\vm\virtualbox-gen\test.txt' -> '/root'
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Closing guest session ...

But the file I end up with in the guest is actually placed in / and called root\test.txt!
VBoxManage.exe guestcontrol debian11 run %COMMON_OPTS% --exe /usr/bin/ls

...shows it:
(...)
proc
root
root\test.txt
run
sbin
(...)

I've tried using the --target-directory switch and it behaves the same. Also fumbled around with some quoting and escaping, however I don't think any should be necessary in this case. No luck there either.
Any clues how to solve this problem?
