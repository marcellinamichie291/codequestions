# How to add a running to Redis?

From several servers I would like to add keys like doc:1 and then doc:2 etc.
Now in order that the different servers do not try to add to, say, doc:2 at the same time, I thought there is some mechanism like "add to doc:{index}" and the index gets automatically bumped.
Is there some way to make that work?
