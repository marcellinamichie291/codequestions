# How to align enlarged CircularProgressIndicator by the enlarged circle center?

I would like to align an enlarged Compose CircularProgressIndicator by its enlarged center point instead of by the center point of the original non-modified circle.
The following aligns as if CircularProgressIndicator were not modified at all, which is demonstrated by the attached screenshots.
Box(contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
        CircularProgressIndicator(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())
}



I attempted various combinations/orders of alignment modifiers to no avail. Is there a way to fix this without using a manual offset?
