# Indexing a BCOO in Jax

I came across another problem in my attempts to learn jax:
I have a sparse BCOO array, and an array holding indices.
I need to obtain all values at these indices in the BCOO array.
It would be ideal if the returned array would be a sparse BCOO as well.
Using the usual slicing syntax seems to not work. Is there a standard way to achieve this?
e.g.
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax.experimental import sparse

indices = jnp.array([
    [0,1],
    [1,1],
    [2,0],
])

sparse_array = sparse.bcoo_fromdense(
    jnp.array(
        [
            [
                [0,0,0],
                [2,2,2],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0]
            ],
            [
                [1,1,1],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0]
            ],
            [
                [1,1,1],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0]
            ]
        ]
    )
)

# preferably as BCOO itself
result = jnp.array([
    [2,2,2],
    [0,0,0],
    [0,0,0]
])
