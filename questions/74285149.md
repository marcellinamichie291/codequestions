# Scripted jenkins pipeline slackSend is not displaying vertical color line

In Jenkins Scripted (groovy) pipeline, I have below code line
slackSend channel: '#Regression-Testing-Result', 
color: (currentBuild.result.equals("SUCCESS")) ? "good" : "danger",
message: (currentBuild.result.equals("SUCCESS")) ? "Tests passed" : "Tests failed"

Issue :
Tests passed or Tests failed message is printed in slack channel (Regression-Testing-Result) but the colored vertical line is not printed (vertical green line for success, vertical red line for failure)
Jenkins version                  :  2.319.3
Slack Upload Plugin version used : 1.7
