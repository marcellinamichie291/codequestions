# DOCKERFILE, Attirbutes in it

I dont really understand what is WORKDIR
I have seen many sources by no one says exactyly where is that WORKDIR
I am using Windows
WORKDIR /usr/src/my_app_directory
Here is the sample from one website, it says that my workdir is  /usr/src/my_app_directory.
Can I write anything as my workdir if yes where is that workdir?
