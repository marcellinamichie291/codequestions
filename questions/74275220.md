# Loop backwards starting in value (list)

If i have a list calle dates (for example) that goes like this:
[2022,2021,2020....]
Until 20 or 30 values. And I reverse it with
reversed(list)

So it looks like this now:
[1980.1981,1982...]
How can I make a loop that starts in value 2020 for example and goes till 2022?
So far i tried in the loop something like this:
for i in reversed(range((len(dates)))):

Which gives me the second list i wrote up, but i can't make it start in a certain index with:
for idx in reversed(range(3,(len(dates)))):

Any ideas on how to fix this?
Thank you.
