# Cannot select from the MySQL view with EF

I had a complex view joining a couple of tables but it freezed my C# app so I simplified it in order to get it to work, however it still freezes and I dont have a clue why.
I have a table called 'admittances' containing: AdmittanceID, Number, Date, Notes.
I created a view which selects three of those: AdmittanceID as ID, Number as Number and Date as Date.
In a database it just works, no big deal. I mapped it via 'Update model from database' option in a model wizard inside C# EF model and it shows up as an entity with three columns and entity key column 'ID'.
However while trying to loop over all the records the program stops working and does not go any further (in debugging it just does not pass through the loop).
meraserwEntities db = new meraserwEntities();

var myQuery = db.clientstodevices.ToList();

//Tried also other versions that are listed below

var myQuery = from d in db.clientstodevices select d;

foreach (var item in myQuery)
{
    ClientsToDevices.Add(item);
}

// Or without loop - then it freezed exactly in this line

ClientsToDevices = db.clientstodevices.ToList();

Please help, tried everything ..
