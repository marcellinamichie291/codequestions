# Problems passing a list from MVC Controller to a View

I'm experiencing a problem passing a list from a controller to a view.  Doing it this way works fine but I don't want to be passing the entire table.  What I want to do is pass just the results of the studies query:


ViewBag.studyList = new SelectList(_context.Studies.OrderBy(p => p.Name), "Id", "Name");



but if I put studies instead of _context.Studies like this:


var studies = (from t in _context.Studies
              where !((from s in _context.Studies
               join sn in _context.StudyNodes on s.Id equals sn.StudyId
               where sn.NodeId == id
               select s.Id).ToList()).Contains(t.Id)
               select new BundleNodeViewModel
               {
               StudyId = t.Id,
               StudyName = t.Name
               }).ToList();

ViewBag.studyList = new SelectList(studies.OrderBy(p => p.StudyName), "Id", "Name");



it throws a null exception error in the View.  How can this be a problem?  I need to pass the filtered results as per the studies query and not the entire list which is the only way it seems to work.  Can someone help please so I can pass studies and not _context.Studies. Thanks for your help.
