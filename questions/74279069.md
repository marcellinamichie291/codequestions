# can you help me with an upcoming assignment

static RAM memory design in 4x4 dimensions (schematic drawing - pdf) and application (simulation In the program - for example, Logisim). In design and simulation;
1.Flip flops will be used to store information.
2.4 bits of information can be saved in the selected Memory Line and any memory selected the 4-bit information on the line will be readable. (The information to read can be obtained from the keys, Data read can be shown on LEDs)
3.Code decoder needed (to be used and designed for address line selection), control signals (read/write), clock signals, selection signals, logic doors are available. signals such as read/write can be generated using keys.
4.PDF file and simulation screenshot will be uploaded to the LMS system. And also
the simulations will be checked.
maybe it's too easy, but i don't know how to do it, so i'm ttrust your information
