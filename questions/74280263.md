# Nuxt JS watch route change globally and do something

I'm working with Nuxt JS v2 and need to run a function on every page change & during page loads, I understand that I can add a route watcher in my layout, but this would mean having to add it to every layout, and I have many, e.g:
<script>
export default {
  watch: {
    $route(to, from) {
      console.log('route change to', to)
      console.log('route change from', from)
    }
  }
}
</script>

I have a plugin called cookie-tracking.js and was hoping that if I add a console.log to it that it would be called on each page change, but no, what could I add for this behaviour to occur:
export default ({ app, route }, inject) => {
  console.log('run on each page change...')
}
