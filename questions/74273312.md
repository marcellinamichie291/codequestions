# Python str() double quoted string

I know this question sounds very naive but I am stuck with it. I am using jquery autocomplete and it turns out that it needs ["data1", "data2"] form of list. 
I am getting data from a json file and 
data = json.load(fobj)['content']
data = [str(data[d]['name']) for d in data.keys()]

['some text', 'some other '....]
but I specifically want a double quoted string in list. I have tried repr(str(data)) but in it gives "'some text'" and then "'some text'".strip("'") but again this returns a single quoted string.
To get the work done i am doing 
data = [str(data[d]['name'] + "'") for d in data.keys()]

and later process the "'" at the end of string but this is not the right way.
Is there any way with which i can force str() to return double quoted string something like str(data, quote='"').
