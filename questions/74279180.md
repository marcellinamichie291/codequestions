# Why do x+x and !(x+x) appear to have the same value when x=(int)0x80000000?

I wrote the following code
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 0x80000000;
    printf("x+x = %d; !(x+x) = %d\n",x+x,!(x+x));
    return 0;
}

and compile by gcc 11.3.0 in both WSL2(Ubuntu) and Debian x86_64
but the answer is
x+x = 0; !(x+x) = 0

Could anyone explain what happened in ! to get the wrong answer? Thanks very much.
I've tried on different machines but the answer is the same. Or maybe overflow causes flag change which effects !?  I wonder the answer...
