# Aws LightSail - Start instance based at an event

I want to automatically start an instance that turned off.
I already have a lambda function to turn off and on, working properly. CloudWatch seems to be the way to do this in an automatic way, but im getting nowhere about to launch the lambda function when the machine turns off.
How to do it?
Searched aws knowledgebase, but no sucess with Lighsail.
