# BLL and DLL are not founded, when I move them somewhere except source repos(Visual Studio 2019)

I have 3-layer MVVM project, my solution folder, DLL folder and BLL folder are inside 'source > repos >' and project loads normally
But if I move BLL or DLL(or both) to some other folder, or Desktop for example, my project doesn't load correctly and file moved to Desktop defined as not founded in solution explorer
How could I fix it? I need put all this three project folders(DLL, BLL, View) to one folder, because I need to share it as one big project, but I can't, because any movement with files or folder finishes with error 'Files not founded'
Sadly can not send images here, in y question(
Thanks in advance for your answers!
