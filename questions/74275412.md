# How to copy a cell formula from one cell to a specific number of rows in excel?

I seek your help on this workbook.
I have column A that contains data, and I have column B that contains data but with less number of rows (e.g. column A has 100 rows filled, and column B has 5 rows filled)
I need a macro that can copy the formula from B1 and paste it in first empty cell in column B, and end up with the cell that is aligned with column A, i.e from B6 to B100).
Can you help please?
I found something that uses WITH loop, but it takes ages to complete the copy whenever I have large data
