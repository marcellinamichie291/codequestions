# How to get access to window elements

I am writing a program that will get user inputs and store data about GUI elements, which user has clicked in desktop applications.
I need data from GUI like: element name, element description, class, element parent, children, etc.
Code is written on C#. As i found out, i can use Xamarin.Mac to call macOs AppKit API from C# (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/appkit.nsapplication?view=xamarin-mac-sdk-14).
Now the question is what do i call to get this data?
Or is there any alternative way to get this data?
