# Google Data Studio Compare Same site page page views in line graph

As you cannot have a filter per chart line I thought creating a Metric Field and allowing the page views if the URL is x and another if x and so on.
I have tried
CASE 
WHEN CONTAINS_TEXT(page,"cc=2") THEN Page Views
END

But got the error below
Error
Sorry, calculated fields can't mix metrics (aggregated values) and dimensions (non-aggregated values). Please check the aggregation types of the fields used in this formula.
I have four sections in the website so I want four lines and all pages within the sections page views added for that line.
Many Thanks in advance.
