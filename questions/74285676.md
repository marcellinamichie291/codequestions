# Is it possible for Django to sum lengths of a non-numeric field?

I have learned we can sum all(or filtered) columns like price from this question.
ItemPrice.objects.aggregate(Sum('price'))

But is it possible for Django to sum non-numeric field's length, such as CharField or JSONField? A pseudocode is like following.
User.objects.aggregate(Sum(len('username')))
