# How do i stop my login question code from repeating

def login(password, mail, name):
    passx = input("whats your password?")

    if password.lower() == passx:
        mailx = input("whats you email?")

        if mailx.lower() == mail:
            namex = input("whats you name?")

            if namex.lower() == name:
                return True

    return False


if login(password, mail, name):
    print("Login successfully")
else:
    print("Login failed")
    reset = input('forgot you password? do you want to reset it? (yes) (no)')
    if Join.lower() == 'yes':
        print("okay please answer the question")
    else:
        print("okay")

if i enter a wrong answer the code asks the question again and i cant stop it from from running infinitly
I was making a login syestem in python
