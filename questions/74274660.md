# Method is not appending to list like other similar methods

I'm a beginner at pyhton. i'm working on a poker game. currently i'm stuck at dealing every player two cards. dealing the flop, turn and river work fine but dealing the player cards doesn't work. I don't understand why it doesn't work. Any solutions, explanation, other approaches advice are appreciated. Link to my github with the full code Github
    def deal(self, location, times=1): 
        for i in range(times):
            location.cards.append(self.pop(0)) 

    def deal_hole(self):
        count = 0
        while count < 2:
            for player in self.players_not_out:
                self.deck.deal(player, 1)
            count += 1

The Deal_hole method should append two cards to all the player class instances at the attribute cards which is a list, but it returns a empty list.
