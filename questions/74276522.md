# Sentence,String Similarity Comparison in Java

I had a question about the word similarity between the two sentences.
example: Jack go to basketball.
Jack go to basketball match
I want to know the code to find the similarity ratio by dividing the number of words that are the same by the number of words of the long sentence. Which library should I use for this, thank you.
There are many kinds of similarity as similarity. I want to know which similarity title this similarity belongs to.
