# How to do Ephemeral Reveal in place with Interaction

I'm currently using this to reveal what is under a button but it makes a whole new message.  (Nothing at all like the spoiler reveal in discord)
        route = f"/interactions/{interaction_id}/{token}/callback"
        json = {
            "type": InteractionCallback.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
            "data": {
                "tts": False,
                "flags": MessageFlags.EPHEMERAL | MessageFlags.HAS_THREAD,
                "embeds": [{"title": title, "description": content}],
            },
        }

How do I change this to get it to work like reveal and unfurl for only the current reader without spoiling the surprise for everyone in the channel?  I do need it to be an interaction, I can't use the actual reveal because the message is unique for each person that reveals it. (I also track when they revealed it back on the server)
Using type: InteractionCallback.UPDATE_MESSAGE results in an edited message and the first person spoils the surprise for everyone.
