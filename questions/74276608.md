# Repository methods exposure - Spring Data Rest

Why spring data rest expose all http methods even though the documentation says "Each of the resources listed below will define which of the methods need to be present so that a particular HTTP method can be exposed for each of the resources. That means, that repositories that are not exposing those methods — either by not declaring them at all or explicitly using @RestResource(exported = false) — won’t expose those HTTP methods on those resources."
not all of http methods
