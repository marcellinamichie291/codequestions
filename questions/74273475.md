# Is there a way to format the outcome of a find function in VBA as a number (in outlook)?

I have set up an outlook template to automate sending emails (containing information from an excel database) using VBA. I have succeeded to copy all information needed in the email using a find function. However, when I want to copy the outstanding balance (which is a digit), the formatting used in excel is not copied to the email that is generated in outlook.
I am using the following code to copy the number I need from excel to the generated outlook mail:
Sub Send_email_fromtemplate()
Dim edress As String
Dim cc1, cc2, cc3 As String
Dim group As String
Dim balance As String
Dim outlookapp As Object
Dim outlookmailitem As Object
Dim r As Long
Dim olInsp As Object
Dim wdDoc As Object
Dim oRng As Object


 r = 3

Do While Sheet1.Cells(r, 1) <> ""
    Set outlookapp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    'call your template
    Set outlookmailitem = outlookapp.CreateItemFromTemplate("G:\CCLAW & VIEWPOINT\Invoicing and reminding\Reminding project Noa\Reminding template final\official template final 1.oft")
    outlookmailitem.Display

    edress = Sheet1.Cells(r, 7)
    cc1 = Sheet1.Cells(r, 8)
    cc2 = Sheet1.Cells(r, 9)
    cc3 = Sheet1.Cells(r, 10)
    group = Sheet1.Cells(r, 4)
    balance = Sheet1.Cells(r, 6).Value
    With outlookmailitem
       .To = edress
        .cc = cc1 & ";" & cc2 & ";" & cc3
        .bcc = ""
        .Subject = "Invoice reminder " & group
        
        Set olInsp = .GetInspector
        Set wdDoc = olInsp.WordEditor
        Set oRng = wdDoc.Range
        With oRng.Find
            Do While .Execute(FindText:="{{Outstanding Balance}}")
                oRng.Text = balance
                Format = "#,###.##"
                Exit Do
            Loop
        End With
        Set xInspect = outlookmailitem.GetInspector
  

Using Format = "#,###.##" I hoped to update the formatting of the outstanding balance (so that e.g. 23153.5 is formatted as 23,153.50 in the generated outlook email, but this did not work out.
I hope someone would be able to help!
