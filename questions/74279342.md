# Verifying hash password PBKDF2 with Java

I am currently following a tutorial: https://www.baeldung.com/java-password-hashing
Section 5.2
However, now that the has has been created, a followup question to this tutorial was.. I just hashed a password and made it unreadable - how in the world will we verify it?!
Currently i have this easy method setup:
public byte[] generateHash(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    
    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
    byte[] salt = new byte[16];

    random.nextBytes(salt);

    KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 65536, 128);
    SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("BPKDF2WithmacSHA1");

    byte[] hash = factory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();

    return hash;

}

But i'm missing the actual authentication method...
