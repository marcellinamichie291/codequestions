# Best way for saving information from a program in Java

I'm using Maven to write a java program and this program will read information from a .txt file in src->main->resources folder. During the program, the user can modify the information read from the .txt file, and I want to write the updated information to the same .txt file at the end of the program, however, this is where I've run into a problem.
I read that you can't write to a file located inside the resources folder while the jar file is running. So, how would I save information from a program if I can't write to a file located inside the resources folder? Or, is there a way and I just don't know about it?
Keep in mind, I want this program to be usable on any computer, so saving the file on my local disk isn't ideal.
Any help is greatly appreciated!
