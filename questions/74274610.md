# In what ways is Typer useful for developing FastAPI applications?

I've been playing around with FastAPI, and I love it. I'm also aware that FastAPI's developer, Sebastián Ramírez, also developed Typer, a library for building CLI apps. I was wondering how Typer can be useful in developing FastAPI applications. Thanks.
