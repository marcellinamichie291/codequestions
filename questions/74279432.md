# Missing following properties while rewriting react function from js to ts

I am rewriting my js project to typescript with react and I have the following function to create dataContext which I try to rewrite:
javascript version
import React, {useReducer} from 'react'

export default (reducer, actions, defaultValue) => {
    const Context = React.createContext()

    const Provider = ({children}) => {
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, defaultValue)

        const boundActions = {}
        for (let key in actions) {
            boundActions[key] = actions[key](dispatch)
        }

        return (
            <Context.Provider value={{state, ...boundActions}}>
                {children}
            </Context.Provider>
        )
    }

    return {Context, Provider}
}

And here is my typescript version
import React, {useReducer, createContext, ReactNode} from 'react'

export default (reducer: any, actions: any, defaultValue: any) => {
    const Context = createContext(defaultValue)

    const Provider = (children: ReactNode) => {
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, defaultValue)

        const boundActions: any = {}
        for (let key in actions) {
            boundActions[key] = actions[key](dispatch)
        }

        return (
            <Context.Provider value={{state, ...boundActions}}>
                {children}
            </Context.Provider>
        )
    }

    return {Context, Provider}
}

I get the following error which I do not know how to solve. I tried some other types on children like ReactNode[], JsxElement[], Element[] etc but nothing works.
Type '{ children: Element; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ReactNode'.
  Type '{ children: Element; }' is missing the following properties from type 'ReactPortal': key, type, props
