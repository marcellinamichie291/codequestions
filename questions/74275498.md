# Speed test of specific interface in terminal (Linux)

I want to measure uploading/downloading speed on Raspberry Pi OS. I need to measure the speed on both eth0 and wlan0 interfaces. The most popular tool I've found is speedtest-cli, BUT It's not possible to specify a network interface making a speedtest.
There is a thing called 'source' which is an IP of the source (don't understrand this thing really), some people say that It may do the trick, but I've tried, and have time out error (see the screenshot)

I know It's possible to specify interface making a request via curl, so theoretically i could download and upload some random file, but I don't feel the results will be always correct using this approach, because they'll be heavily dependent on the server.
Is there some way to specify the interface making a speedtest?
