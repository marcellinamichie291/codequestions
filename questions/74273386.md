# Accessing google oAuth access token to read/ write google drive

I'm trying to get the token from oAuth playground https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ for getting the token but it has expiration time so need to access it in the code base.
In code I'm trying to get the access token like this :
let token = gapi.client.getToken() , but gapi.client is coming undefined
