# how can i roll my code back to my last commit

my colleague and are both very new to git and GitHub.
last week at work we each made commits to our own branches of the project from our computers at work.
this week we both work at home and we don't have access to our work computers.my colleague tried to merge our work yesterday and there was a problem and some of my code in my own branch got deleted and we need to fix it somehow.
is there a way to clone my branch into my home computer and then roll it back to my last commit i pushed when i was at work?
