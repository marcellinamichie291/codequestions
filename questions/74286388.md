# How do I define an array of optional items, where each item has its own schema?

I have the use case where an array can optionally contain items, but each item when present needs to comply to its own defined schema. I tried this:
     "plugins": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": [
            {
              "$ref": "plugins/oidc/oidc_apigw-plugin-schema.json"
            },
            {
              "$ref": "plugins/oidc/oidc_websso-plugin-schema.json"
            }
          ]
        }

but it does not meet the requirements, since it is expecting those two items in that specific order. It must be something related to this https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/conditionals.html, but I have no idea how to apply it correctly. Here my attempt:
    "plugins": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "object"
            }
          ],
          "dependentSchemas": {
            "oidc_apigw": {
              "$ref": "plugins/oidc/oidc_apigw-plugin-schema.json"
            },
            "oidc_websso": {
              "$ref": "plugins/oidc/oidc_websso-plugin-schema.json"
            }
          }
        }
