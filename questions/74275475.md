I am using hono to get IoT Data to my Jhipster-Ionic Application. How to
a) send http get request to hono api, to fetch data and show it on my echarts dashboard.
b) How do i send commands back to Hono using my application to control my IoT devices?
c) how do i send hono data into postgres database (my application database) for showing historic data). THANKS
