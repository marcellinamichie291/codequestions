# Can an event camera work well in an indoor environment with no sunlight?

I am very interested in UAV obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms.
Every once in a while, I come across researchers working on obstacle avoidance algorithms using event data:

I believe the advantages of using event based cameras are:

They have a very high Hz, allowing a high resolution inference on obstacle movements
The features to be tracked are some what pre-filtered in the sense that the camera already gives you only the intensity differences ( quite similar to how optical flow works)

But I am afraid that because of the extremely fast frame rate as mentioned in advantage-1),
it may not be suitable for a perfectly closed environment with no sunlight(which has almost infinite Hz); if the indoor illumination frequency is less than ~2x the frequency of the event camera, the event camera output will be predominantly tracking the light bulbs flashing.
Am I missing something here?
Do the event-based cameras take care of this issue in their SoCs?  If so, could anyone recommend me such event camera?
Do these algorithms somehow post-process the affected frames?

Read research papers.
