# Guidance for deploying Redis Cache for Kubernetes Microservices

I am looking to implement Redis Cache for a number of web applications in Kubernetes, but am not sure how exactly to architect the Redis Cache part.
I was thinking that if I have 5 replicas of my application, they could all use a single Redis Cache in a separate pod, as I wanted to avoid using a sidecar container for each application pod. Then for each application, they have their own Redis Cache Deployment in Kubernetes, and the application connects to this (by a service I guess).
Does this sound like a suitable plan?
How does the application talk to the Redis Cache pod, do I need to expose it via a Service?
I've seen that you should co-locate your Redis Cache and Application on the same node, is this a concern, and is there a way to do this?
