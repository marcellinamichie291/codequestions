# PineScript - How to link scripts with input.source?

I'm trying to link scripts as described in input.source section, but my list of sources has only "internal" values. I'm testing it with the same ALMA script as shown on the documentation screenshots. What I'm doing wrong?

I was trying to read value from one script with another using
ext1 = input.source(title = "ext1", defval = close)
but list of inputs do not contain outputs from other scripts
