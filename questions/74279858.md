# Can't connect to local mosquitto broker with mqtt.js

I have tried connecting to a local mosquitto broker running on my laptop with mqtt.js.
I can connect with paho-mqtt with python over TLS. I exporting the client of my_mqtt.js and using it in a vue app
my_mqtt.js
import * as mqtt from "precompiled-mqtt";

var options = {
    host: '192.168.1.161',
    port: 8883,
    protocolId: 'ws',
    clientId: 'mqttjs_' + Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8)
}

// initialize the MQTT client
const client = mqtt.connect("ws://192.168.1.161:8883", options);

// setup the callbacks
client.on('connect', function () {
    console.log('Connected');
});

client.on('error', function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});

client.on('message', function (topic, message) {
    // called each time a message is received
    console.log('Received message:', topic, message.toString());
});

// subscribe to topic 'my/test/topic'
client.subscribe('my/test/topic');

// publish message 'Hello' to topic 'my/test/topic'
client.publish('my/test/topic', 'Hello');

export default client;
