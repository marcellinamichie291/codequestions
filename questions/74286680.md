# Make Call on Android, mic Input Usb-C and Output Bluetooth headset

I bought a USB C lavalier microphone for my android phone.
Is it possible during a call and to have the voice in my lavalier microphone and the sound in my bluetooth headset (My bluetooth headset also has a microphone, but I don't want use this one)
To resume split my audio config:
Input: Usb-C
Output: Bluetooth
Note: I have a pixel 6 PRO and Android 13
