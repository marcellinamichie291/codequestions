# How do I set up my public_html dir in EC2?

For most of my projects on my school server, we used a public_html dir to put our html and php files into.
I am trying to set up a EC2 server (with Ubuntu) to host my personal projects and I want to have a public_html folder so I can maintain the way I have my files organized.
I have set the permissions of the public_html dir to 705 and have a test file named index.html.
While I can host html files out of var/www/html, I don't want to do that.
Some of my readings suggest changing the DocumentRoot in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file but I don't know what I need to change or at how many places.
Please help me solve this or recommend resources as I am new to Linux.
