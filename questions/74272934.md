Is there any way to install app on iphone using .ipa file with unlimited number of devices on iphone? Can a regular Apple Developer account ($99/year) do this? Is it possible not through the App Store and accompanying procedures?
I would like to describe more about the characteristics of my app: My app connects to the web api to get internal data, does not allow to register an account on the app or the web, but the account is granted by the administrator.
If there is no way, is it possible to publish the App Store with the feature of not allowing account registration on the app?
Sorry my bad English.
