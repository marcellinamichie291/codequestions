# How to display all the rows below a specific id python

how can I display all the rows after a specific id. and then update it. I'm using python and sqlite3
my query::
self.db_conn.execute("SELECT url,id FROM selected_urls WHERE id=15000")
self.urls = self.db_conn.fetchall()
try:
    db_conn1.execute('''UPDATE selected_urls SET url_https_status = ?,url_check = ?,url_status = ?, content_status = ? WHERE id = ?''',('YES','YES','VALID','YES',url[1]))
    db_conn1.commit()
    self.https += 1
    time.sleep(5)
except:
    continue

if I run the below query it work exactly I want. but I want to work with ID's through different PC because database is too big with one machine it take a lot of time. once I run it in different machines I want to combine all the data in one table.
self.db_conn.execute("SELECT url,id FROM selected_urls WHERE url_check = 'NO' AND url_status = 'INVALID'")
