# How to let the gsutil command output message disappear?

My shell script command is look like this below
if [ -z "$(gsutil ls gs://my-bucket/folder)" ]; then
       echo "good"
else
       echo "bad"
fi


My question is how to let the outcome of the script = good ,and the command message will not show to the screen?
I tried tail,sed before, but failed ,it still be "good" but the outcome message still show up due to the gsutil.
pls help~
