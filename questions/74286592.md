# Problem with OData query in Microsoft Flow for GetItems action on a SharePoint list having 20000+ rows

I have created a Microsoft Flow (PowerAutomate), to retrieve records from a SharePoint list. The list has 22,300 records in it. I have written the below OData filter query. The column (Email) is of Person type.
Email/EMail eq 'me.someone@company.com'
But none of the records are retrieved. However, if I give the below query, the same record is retrieved.
ID eq 22102
The list contains the below records.




ID
Email




22102
Me someone


2
another person




However, if I query for the email id of the 2nd record (another.person@company.com), it is retrieved fine.
Email/EMail eq 'another.person@company.com'
I am wondering is there any limitation towards retrieving records greater than 20000? Really surprised why the second record is retrieved and not the first one? Or do I have to tweak any pagination settings?
When retrieving using ID, it works fine, while for Person, it is not. Is there any indexing I need to enable for query to work beyond 20,000?
