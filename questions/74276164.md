# Nuxt3 middleware redirect not always executed

I have a redirect on my dashboard to check if a user is not logged in. The middlware in my nuxt3 project looks like this:
middlware/auth.js
import {authStore} from '~/store/auth'

export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
    const auth = authStore()
    
    if (!auth.loggedIn) {
        return navigateTo({path: '/login', query: {redirect: to.path}})
    }
})

middlware/redirect.js
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (to.path === '/dashboard') {
    return navigateTo('/dashboard/test2')
  }
})

This is added in my top level dashboard page.
dashboard.vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: ["auth", "redirect", "subscription"]
})
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtLayout name="dashboard-with-sidebar">
      <NuxtPage/>
    </NuxtLayout>
  </div>
</template>

Different dashboard pages are subpages of dashboard.vue. Now when I go to a link inside the dashboard. For example: localhost:3000/dashboard/test, I get redirected to the login properly like so: http://localhost:3000/login?redirect=/dashboard/test. After logging in the redirect link is used to go to the correct page.
However, when I open a new tab, close the current tab and again go to localhost:3000/dashboard/test I get redirected again to http://localhost:3000/login?redirect=/dashboard/test and I don't see any logs from the auth.js middleware that is executed. Different urls work correctly.
How do I make sure that after the first redirect, the same url doesn't get automatically redirected again?
