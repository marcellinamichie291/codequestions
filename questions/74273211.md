# In React Native / Expo, how to retrieve the context of a canvas?

In React Native, I need to retrieve the context of a canvas in order to use the getImageData function (my end goal is to retrieve the ImageData from a png file, if you have a direct solution for this it's more than welcome :) ):
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';

export default function somefunction() {
      const canvas = React.createElement(
        "canvas",
      );
      canvas.getContext("2d")
      return (
            <View> </View>
      )
}

But then I get this error:

TypeError: canvas.getContext is not a function. (In 'canvas.getContext("2d")', 'canvas.getContext' is undefined)

I looked on other post but they are not related to React Native
Many thanks !
