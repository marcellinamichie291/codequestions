# Typescript and Map returning error message

I have 2 interfaces that have the following properties
export interface parent{
   fName: string;
   addresses: Array<address>;
}

export interface address{
   street: string;
   city: string;
   state: string;
   zip: string;
}

In my code I load the parent class and the address properties from JSON.
When I try to retrieve the array of "street" properties, I use the following code.
var father = parent;
var streets = father.map(x=>x.street);
I am receiving an error stating father.map is not a function.
What am I doing wrong?
