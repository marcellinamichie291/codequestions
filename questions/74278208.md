# Why won't ADF list the contents of my S3 bucket?

I'm trying to ingest data from my S3 bucket into Azure via ADF. I added a new connection by entering my Access key ID and Secret access key, and 'Test Connection' against my Service URL (https://myS3BucketName.s3-myRegion.amazonaws.com) works:

However, when I try to browse the contents of my bucket, nothing shows up:

From within a VM with the AWS CLI installed, I can use these exact same credentials and list the contents of the bucket successfully:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myAccessKeyId
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=mySecretAccessKey
aws s3 ls s3://myS3BucketName/

For the policy associated with this access key, I even granted all S3 permissions (even though I already had GetObject, ListBucket, GetObjectVersion, ListAllMyBuckets, and more).
How can I best debug this issue? My goal is to do a daily ingestion of files or directories that, in most cases, I will know the exact name of. So if there's a good way to attempt copying of files by exact name without necessarily doing a bucket directory listing, that may be acceptable.
