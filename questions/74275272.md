# Sharepoint List default values from GET input

Is there a way in Sharepoint to use arguments passed to the URL via GET requests as default arguments to a New Item on a List?
I have a list designed to track information about internal metrics. Each metric has a MetricID and will likely have multiple entries on the list. I can link members of my team to the New Item page for this list. However, I would like to be able to pass the MetricID to the New Item form without the team member having to enter it (as this can lead to human error).
I had the idea of using the a GET request, so the URL linked to would be something akin to:
https://{CompanyName}.sharepoint.com/sites/{TeamName}/Lists/MetricTracker/NewForm.aspx?MetricID=AAA001
As I will be sending the links to team members, I believe a GET request attached to the end of the URL would be the simplest way to implement this. However, I'm not completely tied to this strategy and so if I can create a dynamic default value, that would be great!
I have cross-posted this this on the Sharepoint Stack Exchange, but wanted to broaden the audience as this might be possible using regular HTML inputs
