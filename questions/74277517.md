# How I can fetch data by couple parameters in Mongoose? (First is fetching by date Range and it's work but I need one more parameter)

I have a problem and I don't know how to fix this.
I have some orders that fetching by mongoose by range of date
But i need one more parameter that will fetch by range and if order is new.
there is my code:
       // fetch orders in current month
       const orders = await Order.find({
           createdAt: {
               $gte: start,
               $lte: end
            }
        })

I was trying to make something like this code below but it's not working..
       // fetch orders in current month which flag isNew
       const orders = await Order.find({
           createdAt: {
               $gte: start,
               $lte: end
            },
           
           isNew: true,
        })
