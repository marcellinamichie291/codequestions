# Multiply 1 element of a row with 1 element of a column in pandas and sum the product

I very new in python and I'm trying to have a first approach in pandas.
I have two dataframes, two tabs, made in this way:
df1
index | value_1 | value_2 | value_3 | value_4
0        1          2.5        3        5.5
1        5           1         2         3
2        8.58        4         1.5       1
3        2           0         0         0 
4        7           17        8         9`

df2
index | coeff_1 | coeff_2 | coeff_3 
0        1           0         1       
1        0           1         0         
2        0           1         1      
3        1           0         0          
4        1           1         0 

considering the first row of df1
 | value_1 | value_2 | value_3 | value_4
      1          2.5        3        5.5`

and considering the first column of df2
| coeff_1 |
     1             
     0               
     1                  
     1

I would like to do 1*1 + 2.5*0+1*3+5.5*1
I tried to create the dataframes but I was not able to do this operation.
