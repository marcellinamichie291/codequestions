With the python code below, I am able to get the second Tuesday of the current month. But how can I find the second Tuesday of the previous month?
c = calendar.Calendar(firstweekday=calendar.SUNDAY)
monthcal = c.monthdatescalendar(datetime.today().year, datetime.today().month)
try:
    second_tuesday = [day for week in monthcal for day in week if
            day.weekday() == calendar.TUESDAY and day.month == datetime.today().month][1]
 #   print(second_tuesday)
except IndexError:
    print('No date found')
