# Sql code to get alphanumeric onsecutive sequence order range

I need to get the sequential ranges in a sequence. if there is a break in the sequence i need it to reset.I have a set of alphanumeric ranges and need to see which are taken and which are available. The taken ones are the ones that have already been removed.
CREATE TABLE #MyTable
([Value] varchar(4))
INSERT INTO #MyTable
([Value])
VALUES
('AAAA'),
('AAAB'),
('AAAC'),
('AAAD'),
('AAAE'),
('AAAF'),
('AAAG'),
('AAAH'),
('AAAI'),
('AAAJ'),
('AAAK'),
('AAAL'),
('AAAM'),
('AAAR'),
('AAAS'),
('AAAT'),
('AAAU'),
('AAAV'),
('AAAW'),
('AAAX'),
('AAAY'),
('AAAZ'),
('AAA0'),
('AAA6'),
('AAA7'),
('AAA8'),
('AAA9')
i am expecting to see the following as an example
AAAA - AAAM
AAAR - AAA0
AAA6 - AAA9
