# Some problem downloading PDF inside iframe

I'm generating a PDF inside an IFRAME. So far so good, all the data coming from the BD appears.
But when I right click to save, the data coming from the BD is blank.
NOW....
If I open the same screen outside of IFRAME, I can save the file with the data normally.
Do you have to activate something to be able to save the document coming from the iframe?
Thanks.
<?php
//exit;
$html = ob_get_clean();
$mpdf = new Mpdf();

$mpdf->WriteHTML($html);
$arquivo = "Fatura para seguradora - Contrato " . $row['codigo'] . ".pdf";
$mpdf->Output($arquivo, Destination::INLINE);
?>
