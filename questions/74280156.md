# Merge multiple output chunks to one file in nextflow

I have a nextflow process that outputs multiple files, like below:
[chr1,/path/to/chr1_chunk1.TC.linear]
[chr1,/path/to/chr1_chunk1.HDL.linear]
[chr1,/path/to/chr1_chunk2.TC.linear]
[chr1,/path/to/chr1_chunk2.HDL.linear]
.....

The above example I got after using transpose() operator.
Now, I want to concatenate All chunks and all chromosome together ordered by chunk and chromosome number so that I get 1 file for TC and another file for HDL. I have multiple traits in many chunks so this link wouldn't be helpful. output files (chromosomal chunks) merging in nextflow
Any help?
