# Rearranging Table TR elements from bottom right to top

I have the following HTML structure which I cannot edit but only modify by adding javascript or css code to it. I'm trying to solve a problem where I want to rearrange these boxes in different orientations. I'm guessing this is what the "grid layout" can do? But since this is a table, I'm not sure how to approach this.
Would I be able to just convert the table tags into display:block? And then apply a grid layout?
I want to be able to have the numbers start from the bottom right going to right to left. And other orientations from top to bottom going right to left. Can this be done in just CSS?
