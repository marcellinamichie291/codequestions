# Select multiple distinct rows

I have a table with following data.
id country serial other_column
1  us      123    1
2  us      456    1
3  gb      123    1
4  gb      456    1
5  jp      777    1
6  jp      888    1

7  us      123    2
8  us      456    3
9  gb      456    4
10  us     123    1
11  us     123    1

Is there a way to fetch 2 rows per unique country and unique serial?
For example, expecting following results from my query.
us,123,1 comes twice cos there was 3 of the same kind and I want 2 rows per unique country and unique serial.
us,123,1
us,123,1 
us,456,1
gb,123,1
gb,456,1
jp,777,1
jp,888,1

I can't use:
select distinct country, serial from my_table; 

Since I want 2 rows per distinct value match for country and serial. Pls advice.
