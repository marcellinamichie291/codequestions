# How to print name under the column that has the max value? (pandas) (python)

The data sheet I am working with is organized with the columns: 'Country', 'Internet Users', and 'Population'. I am able to work out and print the max percentage of population using internet, but how do I print the name of the country with that max percentage. For example, Indonesia will have the max with 94% but I am only able to print "94%". I want to print "Indonesia 94%".
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pop = pd.read_csv('country_internet.csv')
op = input("Enter output file name: ")

pop['Percentage'] = round(pop['Internet users']/pop['Population']*100,2)
pop.plot(x = 'Country', y = 'Percentage')

print("Maximum percentage of all countries:",pop['Percentage'].max(),"%")

plt.show()
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.savefig(op)
