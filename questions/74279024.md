# goquery get all <p> tags from just one selector

I have the following example
<div class="myClass"> 
    <div> 
        <div> 
            <p>1</p> 
        </div> 
    </div> 
        <p>2</p> 
    <div> 
    </div> 
    <p>3</p> 
</div>

How can I extract the 3 p tags using goquery or CSS selectors (or both)
Maybe in this case the selector would be "div.myClass"
