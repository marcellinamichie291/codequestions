# Returning a value from a function in Erlang

Suppose I have a function like this->
time()->  
    Time = get_time(),
    return_time(Time).

How do I write a function get_time() which returns a value from a map(say name = Map) which is already defined in the module using the map:get/3 command. This value should be given to variable Time which is passed further in a function return_time/1.
