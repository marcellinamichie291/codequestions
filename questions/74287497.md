# Detecting consecutive k points in data, which are out of specification limit - Python3

I want to create an SPC chart that will detect data points that are out of specification limits using python.
I have data set that contains column [XX] which is the one that I'd like to test and DateTime type data as an index.

I have already come up with an idea of how to detect points that are out of spec, and points that more than k points in a row are out of spec limit. On the other hand, I assume that there has to be a better way to achieve the same outcome. Below you find my code.
`# first part to detect points that are out of spec
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# creat a upper and lower spec limit (that are used to plot a line on an SPC chart)
df['USL_MarginesG'] = 5.5
df['LSL_MarginesG'] = 3
# create empty list to contain data points that are out of spec
occ_trace_x = []
occ_trace_y =[]

# for all elements in df['XX'] I look for elements that are out of spec and append them to the created list
for y in range(len(df['XX'])):
    if df['XX'].iloc[y] > 5.5 or df['XX'].iloc[y] < 3:
        occ_trace_x.append(df.index[y])
        occ_trace_y.append(df['XX'].iloc[y])`

The second part of the code (this part detects k points in a row that are out of spec):
`# create containers for detected data points
list_k = []
list_index = []

# input for user to write a number for k points to detect
k = int(input("Put a number"))

# for data points in df['XX'] test if a slice from [x:x+k+1] is greather/lower that the spec.
for x in range (len(df['XX'])):
    if (all(df['XX'].iloc[x:x+k+1] > 5.5) or all(df['XX'].iloc[x:x+k+1] < 3)):
        if True: 
# take a slice from df and convert it to a list with the aim to append the lists to created containers.

            s = df['XX'].iloc[x:x+k+1].to_list()
            s_index =  df.index[x:x+k+1].to_list()            
            list_k.append(s)
            list_index.append(s_index)`

Next step is to unpack nested list:
`c = []
for x in list_k:
    c = c + x


v = []
for b in list_index:
    v = v + b`

Last step is to plot data set on a chart:
`fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=df.index, y=df['XX'],
                    mode='lines',
                    name='Margines_GÃ³rny'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
                        x= occ_trace_x,
                        y= occ_trace_y,
                        name= "Out of Control",
                        mode= "markers",
                        marker= dict(color="rgba(210, 77, 87, 0.7)", symbol="square", size=4)))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x = v,
    y = c,
    name = f'{k}' + ' parameters in a row are out of control',
    mode = "markers",
    marker= dict(color="yellow", symbol="square", size=4)))
                       


fig.show()`


As a result, I got a plot with data:
-blue line describes the data set
-red squares detect data points out of spec
-yellow squares detect k data points in a row that are out of spec

k = 2

I am looking for optimization of the code (some way that I might achieve the same results in the faster way)
