# Unity FirebaseAuth by phone, VerifyPhoneNumber

My Unity project use FirebaseAuth to sign-in by phone number. When I use method VerifyPhoneNumber, it always return error: Unable to verify the given phone number.
I tried many time with test phone number.
I expect the app will run into one of 2 method: verificationCompleted, codeSent.
