# Laravel validate rule

I have two datepicker input fields: from and to. To ensure that field value to is greater than field value from, I use the after validation rule. Everything is fine up until I leave the from input value null. Because I am applying the validation rule using the input value from.
How can I combine the required and after validation rules without running into this problem?
$from = $request->input('from');
$from = Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d\TH:i', $from)->format('Y-m-d H:i A');
$attributes= request()->validate([
       'from' => 'required|date',
       'to'=> 'nullable|date|after:'.$from,
]);

Data missing error while from input value is empty.
