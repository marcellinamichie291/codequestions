I just want to know:

Is it possible to get a remote job in USA for full stack development or MERN stack to be very specific.

If yes, then WHY people don't do it that often?

Are salaries adjusted to the PPP ( Purchasing Power Parity )
of the country or reduced according to the location of the employee or no?


I can see plenty of remote jobs however I don't know if this works.
