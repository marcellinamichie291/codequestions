# Windows subsystem for Android. Passing parameters from console command

I have developed a simple android app that accepts parameters from ADB. I have installed this application on WSA and It is working fine. My problem is that I do not know how can I launch application passing parameters from the command line. The following command opens my android application (without parameters).
C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\WsaClient.exe /launch wsa://com.myproject.testparameters

I have tried to launch something like this in order to get help from WsaClient but it does not work.
C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\WsaClient.exe /help

How can I solve it? Thank you.
