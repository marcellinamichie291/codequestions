# Could `via-ir` interfere with gas estimation?

I have recently been running into gas estimation errors when interacting with our testnet contracts via ethers.js and Metamask. I was curious if this may be the result of our build where we use the --via-ir build flag. Could this be messing with the gas estimation of certain wallets / ethers.js?
