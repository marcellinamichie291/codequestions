# NX MCD and Beckhoff PLC connection

Hei everyone!
I am working on a project in TwinCAT3 and want to simulate how it would behave in real world. I am trying to control my SolidWorks model using HMI in a project. I found that it is possible to make a connection between NX MCD and Beckhoff PLC. But there is a little information about it.
I saw that there is possibility with EDAG solution, but it is outdated and I haven't really found out how to make it. I know there is also a solution using OPC UA in Beckhoff and somehow connect it to NX MCD.
Note : I have a Student version of NX
