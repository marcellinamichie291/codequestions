# Please explain OpenSSL CVE-2022-3786 'sizeof' change

What is difference between these 2 sizeof operator uses?
From here: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/680e65b94c916af259bfdc2e25f1ab6e0c7a97d6?diff=split
unsigned int *pDecoded

...
memmove(pDecoded + i + 1, pDecoded + i, (written_out - i) * sizeof *pDecoded);
memmove(pDecoded + i + 1, pDecoded + i, (written_out - i) * sizeof (*pDecoded));

I think sizeof *PDecoded returns sizeof pointer to unsigned int.
Whereas, sizeof (*pDecoded) returns sizeof unsigned int.
