I want to write vectors into csv files. The data type could be int and double. Therefore, I use template. But there is an error: 'file' uses undefined class 'std::basic_ofstream<char,std::char_traits>'.
template<typename T>
void write_in(vector<T>& v, string path) {
    std::ofstream file{path};
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)
    {
        file << v[i] << ",";
    }
    file.close();
}

If I don't use template and just consider vector v, and put the code in cpp file, it works.
void write_in(vector<int>& v, string path) {
    std::ofstream file{path};
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)
    {
        file << v[i] << ",";
    }
    file.close();
}

I don't understand why. Would appreciate the explanation and solutions.
