# Spring integration: call/inject another flow in the main flow using spring profile

In my main flow, I have to call or inject a sub-flow implementation depending on the backend implementation. The sub-flow implementation will be different for each backend. It's like an interface with multiple implementation and depend on a variable i.e spring profile a specific implementation will be invoke.
How do I do this in Spring Integration using DSL?
Try using BaseIntegrationFlowDefinition.to(otherFlow)
