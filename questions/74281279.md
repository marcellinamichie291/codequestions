# ffmpeg Best way to scale 4:3 to 16:9 without black bars

I have upscaled x4 with AI some 640x480 images and now are 2560x1920.
Now I need to scale to 1920x1080 without black bars.
So the only way is crop the image but there is no an automatic way (like my TV that work very good).
I have tried this line:
ffmpeg.exe -i bane_load_4_3.png -vf "scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1920:1080:-1:-1" test5.png

that add a black lines and I like to crop but I don't known what is the best comprimise.
Can you help me please ?
Thanks !
