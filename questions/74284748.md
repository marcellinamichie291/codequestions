# FunnelKit Checkout removed .woocommerce-checkout-payment and .woocommerce-checkout-review-order-table in ajax response's fragments

When I enable FunnelKit Checkout plugin, on the checkout page
open chrome devtools network tab, you'll see a ajax request https://example.com/?wc-ajax=update_order_review

When I disable it, it shows

My question is how to restore the 2 missing fields.
I wrote a woocommerce payment plugin, in payment_fields method, I checked if it's a ajax request, it so, I echo forms for user to input credit card number, It works good when I use default woocommerce checkout page.
But when I enable FunnelKit Checkout plugin, the form disappear.
I think it's related to the ajax request (?wc-ajax=update_order_review)
because the response is so different
