# How Many Virtual Table Lookups Occur?

Consider the following example
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
  virtual void Interface() = 0;
  virtual ~Base() {};

protected:
  int Identify() { return SubclassesMustImplement(); }

private:
  virtual int SubclassesMustImplement() = 0;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  void Interface() override { std::cout << Identify() << std::endl; };

private:
  int SubclassesMustImplement() final { return 42; };
};

int main() {
  Derived d;
  Base* b = &d;
  b->Interface();
}

I'm trying to figure out how many virtual table lookups occur here. The first one occurs at b->Interface() which resolves to Derived::Interface. What I am not sure about is if a second virtual table lookup ever occurs. In the body of Derived::Interface, Identify() is not virtual so it is known at compile-time to be Base::Identify(). However, in the body of Base::Interface() we call SubclassesMustImplement(). At this point in the code, is the this pointer referring to a Base or Derived?
If it is pointing to a Base, then a virtual table lookup (ignoring compiler optimizations for a simple case like this) will occur. If it is pointing to a Derived, then final means that no virtual table lookup occurs.
