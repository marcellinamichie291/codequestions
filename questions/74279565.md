# Getting cannot read properties of undefined (reading:'viewMode') in Angular Unit Testing

Hi I have a function which I would like to unit test. This is my function.
let docProcess: IDocProcess;

public onCalling(args) {
    if (this.docProcess.viewMode) {
      this.makeCalls(args);
    }
}

This IDocProcess is an interface:
export interface IDocProcess {
  viewMode: boolean;
  editMode: boolean;
  deleteMode: boolean;
}


I would like to unit test the above function. If I pass docProcess.viewMode as true, makeCalls(args) function should be called. If false, then the function must not be called.
The following is my Unit test code:

 beforeEach(async(() => {

    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [RouterTestingModule],
      declarations: [CallsComponent],
      providers: [
        MockData
      ],
      schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
    }).compileComponents();
  }));


  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(CallsComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });


  it('should call makeCalls() only on View Mode', () => {
    
    component.docProcess.viewMode = true;
    fixture.detectChanges();
    component.onCalling(mockArgsData);    
    expect(component.makeCalls).toHaveBeenCalled();


But the test results get failed. Getting cannot read properties of undefined (reading:'viewMode').
Is this because the Testing module couldn't recognize the interface. A similar situation like this, I am also getting "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting: variable_name)"
Please help me in resolving this.
