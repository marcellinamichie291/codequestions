# WordPress custom search by "s" OR meta fields

I am creating a custom WordPress multilingual search page that needs to use the standard "s" parameter (search by post_title, etc) and also by meta fields (ie fields where I store the title in other languages). The idea is that you get the results when the keyword is in either the "s" fields OR in the meta field.
But I can't get the OR query to be built. I always get AND in the SQL statement. What am I missing?
$metatitle  = '__woo_product_title_fr';

if ($keyword) {
  $args = array(    
    's'              => $keyword,
    'post_type'      => 'product',                
    'meta_query'     => array(           
        'relation'   => 'OR',
        array(
          'key'      => $metatitle,
          'value'    => $keyword ,
          'compare'  => 'LIKE'
        )
    )    
  );
  $search = new WP_Query($args);   
}
