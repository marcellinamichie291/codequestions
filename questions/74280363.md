# How to use 'replace' to remove spaces in data

I made a sentence like below
Select distinct IPC_CLASS_SYMBOL as IPC, count(distinct appln_id) as PATENT_COUNT
From OOO
Where replace(IPC_CLASS_SYMBOL,' ','') in ('G08G|G01W|G01S17/86|G01S15/86|G01S17/894|G01S17/88|G01S17/00')
group by IPC
order by IPC;
I can see only 'title' like below after I run the mysql.
IPC PATENT_COUNT
