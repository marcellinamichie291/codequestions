# How do I call a method from another class without creating an object of the class?

I want to call a method from another class that has extends JFrame in its class. I have another class that has an actionevent listener. I want to call the method from the other class, but I cannot since it wants me to create a new object for my class.
I tried using     Frame frame = new Frame(); But it creates a new frame completely. I need for my program to declare a method within the class without creating the class. My method in the other class is not static. I cant show the code right now.
