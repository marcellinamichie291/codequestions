# Get device Core Data SQLite file from deployed TestFlight app? (Not running from simulator.)

I'm trying to determine if there is a way to get the sqlite file off of my device from a deployed TestFlight build (NOT running from Simulator.)
I have encountered a bug in my TestFlight build that I can't reproduce elsewhere. I'm having a hard time figuring out what's going on without seeing the state the data is in.
Is there a way to extract the sqlite file from my device?
