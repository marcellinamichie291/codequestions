# Query health check endpoints in ASP.NET

I implemented a health check endpoint following this doc. My ASP.NET application is dockerized and runs using docker-compose, with the port mapped/exposed.
Question: I am not sure how to query the health check endpoint from clients such as postman.
When I send a GET request to the /healthz endpoint as the following, postman throws the following error.
http://host.docker.internal:1200/healthz


Error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established

while I can see the following in the logs of the docker container.
