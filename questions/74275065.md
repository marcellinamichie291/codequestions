# Xamarin cosmos DB not working when Deploy on IOS

I working on Xamarin forms and I'am using [Microsoft Cosmod Db][1] database to store and read data.
In the app I can access/write to my cosmos db database in Debug and Release mode when using IOS and Android Simulator.
But once I deploy on Google Play and App Store connect I still can access to my database on Android but not on IOS
My question : I do not understand why Cosmos db Nuget package is not working on IOS once my App is deploy for test in App Store connect
Thanks for your help
