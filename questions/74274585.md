# nuxt auth this.$auth.user outdated

I wrote a little login register tool with nuxt and everything works fine but if im changing the data with a put request, nuxt auth dont "see" the change and stays with outdated data.
In my Dashboard the user data is shown by:


<div id="userInfos">
        Name: {{ this.$auth.user.firstname }}, {{ this.$auth.user.lastname }} <br />
        Username: {{ this.user.username }} <br />
</div>



My put request is like that (wrote it in a javascript helper file)


export async function changeData(id, body) {
    try {
        await axios.put(`http://localhost:8000/users/${id}`, body, {
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': localStorage.getItem('auth._token.local')
            }
        });
        return true;
    }
    catch (e) {
        return false;
    }
}



I already tried things like refreshTokens() but there was also not change. The data is only changing after a logout and login again. Is there a way to update the this.$auth.user data updated after changing it?
