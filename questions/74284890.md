# python pssh show "Authentication error" in chromebook

I have been try below code (python and pssh) on ubuntu and chromeos (chromebook), but only chromeos show "AuthenticationError()". I can ssh to both ubuntu and chromeos by putty or ssh in linux by manually.
And I found when I ssh to chromeos by putty, that will show "Using keyboard-interactive authentication." when ssh success, so have any settings I missing? or any code should be modify?
Thanks.
from pssh.clients import ParallelSSHClient

hosts = ['192.168.0.100', '192.168.0.101'] #192.168.0.100 is ubuntu, 192.168.0.101 is chromeos.
client = ParallelSSHClient(hosts, user=user, password=password)
cmd = 'uname'

output = client.run_command(cmd)
for host_out in output:
    for line in host_out.stdout:
        print(line)

The pssh of python sample code should be worked on chromeos.
