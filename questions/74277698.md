# MongoDB query match a string ONLY IF field is not null

I have a universal search function for my documents that worked until I came across documents with a null field
This is problematic part of the query;
db.collection.find({
'Vehicle.VIN': { $regex: .*${vin.trim()}.*, $options: "i" },
})
If Vehicle.VIN is null it does not return in the query
if only there was a way to write something like...
db.collection.find({
if 'Vehicle.VIN' is NULL then {} else 'Vehicle.VIN': { $regex: .*${vin.trim()}.*, $options: "i" },
})
:)
