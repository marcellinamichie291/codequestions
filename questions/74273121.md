# Receive http response based on SQL script (asp.net)

I have an API endpoint that takes a SQL script in its body content to fetch the needed data from the server. The response JSON structure of this endpoint is as follow:
{
    "result": "the data resulted from the SQL execution",
    "totalrows: "the total number of data rows"
}

Because the data schema will be different based on the SQL sent, I created my data model for the JSON data deserialization as follows:
public class QueryResult
{
    public List<object> result { get; set; }
    public int totalRows { get; set; }
}

I send the request and I successfully receive the data back from the server:
public static async Task<QueryResult> ExecuteQuery(Query query)  
{
    var httpClient = new HttpClient(new HttpClientHandler()
                                        {
                                            UseDefaultCredentials = true 
                                        });
            
    var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(query);
    var content = new StringContent(json, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
    var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(AppSetting.url, content);
    var jsonResult = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<QueryResult>(jsonResult); 
}

Sample of returned JSON (before deserialization):
{"totalrow":1,"result":[{"Name":"Ali","Age":35}]}

The I tried to cast the object based on my desired data model that I will use for my application but get below error message:
            NamesCollection= new List<Name>();

            var data = await ApiServices.ExecuteQuery(sampleQuery);

            foreach (var item in data.result)
            {
                NamesCollection.Add((Name)item);
            }

       


System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject' to type

How can I address this issue? I don't want to create an API call method for each data model and want to stick to one method where I can receive the response from it, deserialize it to a list of objects that I can then transform to which ever data type for the model I want to use.
