# Failed doing npm install showing error "Undefined variable standalone_static_library in binding.gyp" and node-sass chokidar error

I'm updating a 3 years ago ruby on rails and react project trying to npm install but im stuck here getting this error
$ npm install
gyp: Undefined variable standalone_static_library in binding.gyp while trying to load binding.gyp
gyp ERR! configure error 
gyp ERR! stack Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 1

$ npm start
sh: node-sass-chokidar: command not found
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! syscall spawn
npm ERR! file sh
npm ERR! errno ENOENT
npm ERR! frontend@0.1.0 build-css: `node-sass-chokidar src/styles -o src/styles`
npm ERR! spawn ENOENT
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! Failed at the frontend@0.1.0 build-css script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

I tried removing node_modules, update node version and npm version.
