# setAlternateIconName doesn't work on iOS 15, 16

When I run my app on iOS 14/15/16, the property UIApplication.shared.supportsAlternateIcons is set to false. Cannot find a reason why it is set to false in that specific project. Apple documentation does not provide any explanation under what circumstances the property is set false.
Tried with same code but in different fresh application and it works there for every iOS version. Checked the Info.plist file as well, it is correct and the alternate icon names are visible in the Bundle.main.infoDictionary["CFBundleIcons"]
