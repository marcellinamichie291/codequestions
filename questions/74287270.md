# Error in kotlin flow doesn't trigger catch in unit test

With migration to kotlin, view model and recent changes in [kotlin test lib][1] I am working on issue with test.
I have a scenario:

request a web resource asynchronously
in case of error put the request in cache and update state with new pending request

All of this with help of kotlin flow and view model.
Scenario works well when executes on emulator, but fails when I run test for it. The issue is catch block of flow has not been triggered when error has thrown in flow.
Here is the code:
   fun mintToken(to: String, value: Value, uri: String) {
        logger.d("[start] mintToken()")
        viewModelScope.launch {
            repository.mintToken(to, value, uri)
                .catch { it ->
                    if (it is TransactionException
                        && it.message!!.contains("Transaction receipt was not generated after 600 seconds for transaction")) {
                        cacheRepository.createChainTx(to, value, uri) // TODO consider always put in pending cache and remove after it confirms as succeeded
                        val txReceipt = TransactionReceipt()
                        txReceipt.transactionHash = ""
                        emit(Response.Data(txReceipt))
                    } else {
                        emit(Response.Error.Exception(it))
                    }
                }
                .flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)
                .collect {
                    logger.d(it.toString())
                    when (it) {
                        is Response.Data -> {
                            if (it.data.transactionHash.isEmpty()) {
                                state.update {
                                    it.copy(
                                        status = Status.MINT_TOKEN,
                                        pendingTx = it.pendingTx + Transaction(to, value, uri)
                                    )
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        is Response.Error.Message -> {
                            val errorMsg = "Something went wrong on mint a token with error ${it.msg}"
                            logger.d(errorMsg)
                            state.update {
                                val newErrors = it.errors + "Something went wrong on mint a token with error ${errorMsg}"
                                it.copy(status = Status.MINT_TOKEN, errors = newErrors)
                            }
                        }
                        is Response.Error.Exception -> {
                            logger.e("Something went wrong on mint a token ${to}, ${value}, ${uri}", it.error)
                            state.update {
                                val newErrors = it.errors + "Something went wrong on mint a token ${to}, ${value}, ${uri}"
                                it.copy(status = Status.MINT_TOKEN, errors = newErrors)
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
        }
        logger.d("[end] mintToken()")
    }

    @Throws(TransactionException::class)
    override fun mintToken(to: String, value: Value, uri: String): Flow<Response<TransactionReceipt>> {
        return flow {
            throw TransactionException(
                "Transaction receipt was not generated after 600 seconds for transaction",
                "")
        }
    }

Test code for this is:
    @get:Rule
    var instantExecutorRule = InstantTaskExecutorRule()

    // Set the main coroutines dispatcher for unit testing.
    @ExperimentalCoroutinesApi
    @get:Rule
    var mainCoroutineRule = MainCoroutineRule()

    private lateinit var subj: WalletViewModel

    @Test
    fun `when mintToken() is called with correct values, timeout exception is returned and pending tx are updated with new value`() = runTest {
        val to = "0x6f1d841afce211dAead45e6109895c20f8ee92f0"
        val url = "https://google.com"
        val testValue = Value(
            "Software Development",
            BigInteger.valueOf(1000L),
            BigInteger.valueOf(2000L),
            false,
            BigInteger.valueOf(0)
        )

        subj.mintToken(to, testValue, url)

        assertThat(
            "There is no pending transaction after mint a new token with timeout error",
            subj.uiState.value.pendingTx.isNotEmpty()
        )
    }

Test code differs from dev code by replacing dispatcher in MainCoroutineRule and using kotlin construction runTest {}. How does it affect this case? Does issue case lays in some other place?
