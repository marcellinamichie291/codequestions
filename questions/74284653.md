# Chrome "About Chrome" page Webelements

Has anyone tried working on fetching the webelements present on "About Chrome" page(use the following url: "chrome://settings/help").
Although I could see them on DOM and when I try and find them using locators; they don't get highlighted.
Not sure if there is way that I can interact with the webelements.
