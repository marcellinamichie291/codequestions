# Setting up codemirror 6 in ASP.Net core application

I'm a noob regarding codemirror v6 and working with scripts files using imports.
Im trying to get any example working from here
So far i'm not getting anywhere with it. The sources are fetched with npm for example view;
Any help or example for setting stuff like this up is highly appreciated
I would like any kind of working starting point from which i can build
