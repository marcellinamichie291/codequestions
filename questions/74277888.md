# How to mount Angular components in Cypress?

I am trying to test individual components for my Angular project following the guidelines set up in the official Cypress documentation.
I have created the following cy.ts file for one of my components
import {SpInputComponent} from "[abriged]/sp-input.component";

describe('Sp-Input component', () => {
  it('mounts', () => {
    cy.mount('<app-sp-input></app-sp-input>', {
      declarations: [SpInputComponent]
    })
  })
})

Unfortunately, when I try to run the test in Cypress, I get the following NullInjectionError.

The component in question uses a service that is dependent on HttpClient (i.e. uses HttpClient in its constructor). I tried importing the HttpClient module as well as the service that uses it into the test file without success.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
