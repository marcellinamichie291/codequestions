# How to add Jmeter .JMX file in Bitbucket

I am new to Bitbucket and want to run jmeter script through Bitbucket. Here are the commands I have given for configurations:
pipelines:
default:
- step:
script:
- apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y openjdk-11-jre wget
- cd /opt && wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.5.tgz && tar xf apache-jmeter-5.5.tgz
- cd apache-jmeter-5.5/bin
- ./jmeter -n -t "Login.jmx"
However, I am getting below error on the last line:
"An error occurred: The file /opt/apache-jmeter-5.5/bin/Login.jmx doesn't exist or can't be opened"
I would like to know how can I give JMX file path as I have put it on root. I am assuming it is expected to be placed inside jmeter/bin folder? But how?
Thanks for the help!
