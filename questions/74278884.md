# How can I use ADO.NET for PostgreSQL in an ASP.NET Core application

I am currently working on an ASP.NET Core 6 application, and I need to connect and fetch a huge data set from a PostgreSql database.
Considering the the way the data is stored in the table, I wish to use ADO.NET instead of EF Core so that I can write the queries manually instead of using linq.
I am looking for a guide on using ADO.NET to connect to PostgreSQl on ASP.NET Core application and I will appreciate any guide towards that.
I look forward to your helpful answers
Thank you
