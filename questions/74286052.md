# kubernetes resource requests and limits adjustments

I have a k8s cluster in GKE with node autoscaler turned on. I want to maximize the resource utilization, and have applied all the suggestion on requests/limit changes recommended by GKE. At this moment there is 4 nodes as shown in the image below. They all uses n2-standard-2 i.e. 4 GB of memory per vCPU.
Memory request to allocatable ration is quite high compared to CPU request/allocatable.
Wondering if any other machine machine type that better suits my case. or any other resource optimization recommendation?
