# Xlookup macro falling to aggregate data or taking to long

I'm running a Xlookup macro with filtered data. The issues is when it fills down the data takes a really long time to aggregate and it eventually crashes. I have however noticed that when i escape the macro 1 minute in the data actually shows up. I wondering how i can get the data to aggregate without the time lag or having to push escape.

Dim lastrow As Long
lastrow = Sheets("Sheet1").UsedRange.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Row

Dim MyPath As String
MyPath = "F:\VMWare\supplementalfiles"

Dim LatestFile As String
LatestFile = Most_Recently_Modified_ExcelFile_In_This_Folder(MyPath, "xls")
Dim sFormula As String



' Create formula string
sFormula = "=XLOOKUP(RC[-3],'[" & LatestFile & "]Cos'!C3,'[" & LatestFile & "]Cos'!C4,0)"
' Print formula string to immediate window (Ctrl+G) if window is not visible
Debug.Print sFormula

ActiveSheet.Range("A1").AutoFilter Field:=4, Criteria1:="0"
ActiveSheet.Range("D2:D" & Cells(Rows.count, 1).End(xlUp).Row).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Formula = sFormula



''new filter



End Sub

Function Most_Recently_Modified_ExcelFile_In_This_Folder(folderPath As String, fileExtension As String)
fileExtension = Replace(fileExtension, ".", "")
If Right(folderPath, 1) = "\" Then folderPath = Left(folderPath, Len(folderPath))
Dim xFolder, xFile, fileName As String, counter As Integer, latestDate As Date
counter = 0
With CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
   Set xFolder = .GetFolder(folderPath)
   For Each xFile In xFolder.Files
       If Mid(xFile.Name, InStrRev(xFile.Name, ".") + 1, 3) = fileExtension Then
           If counter = 0 Then
               fileName = xFile.Name
               latestDate = xFile.DateLastModified
               counter = 1
           Else
               If xFile.DateLastModified > latestDate Then
                   latestDate = xFile.DateLastModified
                   fileName = xFile.Name
               End If
           End If
       End If
   Next xFile
End With
Most_Recently_Modified_ExcelFile_In_This_Folder = fileName
End Function
