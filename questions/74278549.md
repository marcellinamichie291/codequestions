# Haskell) List comprehension not ending in a square bracket, console freezing

Entering a list comprehension into GHCi does not generate a list, the final square brackets are missing, and the console freezes. This is what I have come up with: `
[13*x + 3 | x <- [1..], rem (13*x + 3) 12 == 5, mod (13*x + 3) 11 == 0, 13*x + 3 <= 1000]

`
I believe the problem lies either with x <- [1..], or 13*x + 3 <= 1001. By 13*x + 3 <= 1000 I meant to determine the upper limit of the values x in x <- [1..] can take. As mentioned, I'm given back a result [341, but it does the second square bracket is missing, and the console freezes.
Thanks in advance to anyone taking the time to respond
