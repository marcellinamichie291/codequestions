# Why doesn't retentioneering graph output a plot?

In retentioneering, there should be a function that outputs a directed graph. However, the following code does not:
data = retentioneering.datasets.load_simple_shop()

data.rete.get_clusters(method = 'kmeans', n_clusters = 8, refit_cluster = True, feature_type = 'tfidf',\
ngram_range = (1,2))

cluster_0 = data.rete.filter_cluster(0)

cluster0.rete.plot_graph(thresh = 0.1, weight_col = 'user_id')


It only outputs
<IPython.lib.display.IFrame at ...>
Out[7]: 'experiments/graph_....html'

I looked at the type of this plot and it turned out to be a string (?)
I also tried to fix this by the code
from IPython.display import HTML
HTML(...)

but it also didn't return a plot, possibly because this is just an object without attribute. But I found no site with attributes for HTML() so maybe it isn't an existing object.
This is all in Spyder. Maybe VSC would output a plot.
Does anyone have an idea how to get a visualization?
