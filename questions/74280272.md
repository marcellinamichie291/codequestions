# Setup windows based SQL connection from Docker container?

A few of our database connections are configured to require windows authentication. I am trying to setup a docker container with a java application which should be able to query those databases. However, I keep getting the following error:

Failed to load the sqljdbc_auth.dll cause : no sqljdbc_auth in java.library.path: [/usr/java/packages/lib, /usr/lib64, /lib64, /lib, /usr/lib]

I am not sure if this is even doable - setting up windows auth from within docker container. Has anybody done it?
FYI - I am using docker for Windows
