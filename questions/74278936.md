# I am Unable to downgrade the node-fetch version to 2.x.x from 3.x.x

So basically i want to run a gatsby project in my local system . Every time i run npm run dev-ssl.
I get an error stating
Must use import to load ES Module:
......
require() of ES modules is not supported
It seems i need to downgrade the node-fetch version which is 3.2.2 in my case.
Steps to downgrade that i did
npm uninstall node-fetch;

npm install node-fetch@2.6.1

npm view node-fetch version

It still shows version 3.x.x . I also tried with -g to delete globally but getting the same result.
