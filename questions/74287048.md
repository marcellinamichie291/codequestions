# Php colour coding groups in table rows

I am having difficult colouring a table based on a group associated with a value in a key.  Extract below.
At the moment the first row of the 'group' shows red, and then the subsequent members of the group are amber, and so on....  I know why that is happening, but for the life on me I cant figure out how to get the loop in the right order to, have all $var['tagid'] that are the same, to be red and then the next different 'tagid' to be the amber, then back to red, etc etc.
$groupid = null;
$output = '<table class="table">';

foreach($data as $key => $var)
{
  echo $var['tagid'];

  if($var['tagid'] != $groupid)
  {
    $output .= '<tr class=table-danger>';

    foreach($var as $k => $v)
    {
      $output .= '<td style="5%">' . $v . '</td>';
    }
  }
  else
  {
    $output .= '<tr class=table-warning>';

    foreach($var as $k => $v)
    {
      $output .= '<td style="5%">' . $v . '</td>';
    }
  }

  $groupid = $var['tagid'];
}
