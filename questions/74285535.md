# get specific list by value python

I have a list of dictionary looks like this.
charts = [[{'select': 'scatter-form'}], [{'select': 'line-form'}]]

I want to get the list by the value of 'select' key.
For example:
scatterform = [{'select': 'scatter-form'}]
lineform = [{'select': 'line-form'}]

this one is not working because of some error list indices must be integers or slices, not str
