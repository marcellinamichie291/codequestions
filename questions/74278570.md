# Apple Rejected Insta saver app Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal

My app was live on appstore. It used to take Instagram media from public api and save it in the app and save it to the device, and it helped to repost. According to Guideline 5.2.3, I was told that it is illegal to save media or download videos from Instagram and I have to submit a new version within 14 days.
I turned off the download to device feature, but I believe the in-app collection creation feature is legal. This feature only saves the url of public content and keeps the url's media image and hashtags registered within the application. It allows to save the media as a collection in the app from the saved url, but Apple persistently rejects the same item (without examining the application fully). Do you have an opinion or suggestion on this subject?
