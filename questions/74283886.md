# Recommendation for PKCS11 wrappers for Java

I am evaluating PKCS11 wrappers for Java. From the wiki, I noticed the IAIK PKCS#11 and the SunPKCS11 Provider. Also, I noticed the xipki wrapper, which should be based on the SunPKCS11. Since SunPKCS11 is from JDK, it looks we should consider it first. Are there other popular PKCS11 wrapper packages that I should look? Also, which PKCS11 wrapper is most recommended?
We hope the package should be stable and resilient to error conditions. For example, the native stack could catch most of the errors and propagate it to the Java stack, without crashing the JVM.
