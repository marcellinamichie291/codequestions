# Sum of column in Python

I would like a code to create a bar chart that displays the sum of the total number of orders per year.
My data available are as follows: A column with the order number (ORDERNUMBER), a column with the corresponding year of the order (YEAR_ID). How to display the sum of the number of orders, for each year ?
Thanks, for helping
mydata = pd.read_csv('/sales_data.csv')
mydata.set_index("ORDERNUMBER", inplace = True)
mydata
df1=pd.DataFrame(mydata, columns =[‘QUANTITYORDERED’,’ORDERDATE’])
df1.hist()
plt.show()

For the moment I just have the 2 columns, but I don't know how to sum the number of orders with the criterion of the year in order to display figures with total for each year.
