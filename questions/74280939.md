# Selecting id's that has at least one observation pre and post in R

I am trying to filter the ID's that has at least one observation in both pre period and post period each. For example, I select ID 1 as that has pre1,2 and post 1, also ID 3 for the same reason. But, ID2,5 does not have post period observations and ID4 does not have pre period observations so those ID's(2, 4, and 5) are dropped.
I am currently divide the sample into pre and post parts and merge them by intersection using merge(pre, post, by='ID', all=FALSE). However, it gives me wrong result so I was wondering if there is other ways to do this. I would appreciate it if you help me with this. Thank you!
