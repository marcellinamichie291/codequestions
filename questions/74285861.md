# Install specific Vue component from app (like installing specific Lodash function)

I created blank Vue3 + Vite project using
npm init vue@3

I am wondering how can I install my components from src/components like for example in lodash library:
npm i lodash.debounce or my-app/component
Thank you!
I have tried to create index.js file in src and export components:
import Button from "@/components/Button/Button.vue";
import Header from "@/components/Header/Header.vue";

export default {
  Button,
  Header
}

but it didn't work.
