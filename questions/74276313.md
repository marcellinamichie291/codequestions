# nothing work on Update Method in LARAVEL-8

$user = Users::where('id', $request->id)->first();
         $user->Name = $request->Name;
         $user->Email = $request->Email;
         $user->password = $request->password;
         $user->update();

This does not work when I use it with put method using POSTMAN  I Defined Route also with PUT Method.
if I get final value in a variable and check the code   if it executed well or not it works fine as  I show
$user = Users::where('id', $request->id)->first();
         $user->Name = $request->Name;
         $user->Email = $request->Email;
         $user->password = $request->password;
        $result = $user->update();

if($result) {
            return
                [
                    'result' => 'Updated Successfully '

                ];
        }

It Return True value  of return "Updated Successfully"
