# Flawed OTP system while OTP verification

I am creating an app where user has to verify their email address once they are registered. This done via an OTP which is send once the users has hit the registration API. If the OTP is valid then we confirm the registration else we remove the user.
When I register a user I also create an OTP object which I associate with the user.
For example,
class Otp{
.
.
.
private User user;

// setter and getter
.
.
}

So here is a scenario. Let's say a user A has registered itself but has not verified themselves yet. Now some other person hits the verification API and by chance sends the same OTP which has been received by user A and user A gets registered. Now the chances for this to happen are very low because my OTP length is going be 7-8 characters long, but not zero.
I see this as a security flaw. Are all the OTP systems flawed like this or I am doing something wrong. If yes can someone suggest a good design for an OTP system.
