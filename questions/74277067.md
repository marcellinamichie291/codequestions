# My code is printing the password that i entered in the text box instead of gussing the password for EX. I put in Box as the password it prints out box

import random
import pyautogui

password = "a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,A,B,C,D,S,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,69,81,!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),<,>,?,/,"
character_list = list(password)
password+pyautogui>password("enter password here:")

guess_password =''
while)guess_password!=password):
    guess_password=random.choice(character_list,k=len(password))
    print(">>>>>"+str(guess_password)+"<<<<<")

I didn't do anything because I couldn't figure it out
