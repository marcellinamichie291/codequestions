# Azure SQL Access Token Error - The server is not currently configured to accept this token

I am using the following code to retrieve an access token so that my application can access an Azure SQL database:
        public static SqlConnection CreateAzureConnection(IConfiguration _configuration, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var objDefaultAzureCredentialOptions = new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions
            {
                ExcludeEnvironmentCredential = false,
                ExcludeManagedIdentityCredential = true,
                ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential = true,
                ExcludeVisualStudioCredential = false,
                ExcludeVisualStudioCodeCredential = true,
                ExcludeAzureCliCredential = true,
                ExcludeInteractiveBrowserCredential = true
            };

            var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(objDefaultAzureCredentialOptions);

            var token = credential.GetToken(new TokenRequestContext(new[] { "https://database.windows.net/.default" }), cancellationToken);

            SqlConnection conn = new(_configuration.GetConnectionString("Sales"))
            {
                AccessToken = token.Token
            };

            return conn;
        }

This seems fine and I get a token back but when I attempt to connect and run a query I get the following error:
One or more errors occurred. (Login failed for user ''. The server is not currently configured to accept this token.)
I have tried changing the options for what credentials to exclude. The app will be deployed onto an approved environment, but my local dev area is not approved so I have added the VS credentials option. I've confirmed that my credentials in Tools > Options > Azure Service Authentication are correct.
When I use only environment credentials it fails to get the token at all, so I believe everything about the token itself is fine. The error mentions the server not being configured for this token type, so i'm guessing there's some setup that's needed on the Azure SQL server itself, but i've been unable to find what so far
