# How many threads to use when building gem5?

When building gem5, the user can use the -j flag to set the number of threads to use.
In the documentation on building gem5, this note is included:
Note: Iâ€™m using -j9 here to execute the build on 9 of my 8 cores on my machine. You should choose an appropriate number for your machine, usually cores+1

Why is using cores+1 threads "appropriate?
I'm assuming that it has something to do with the fact that if one thread is blocked, there should be another thread to switch to. But at this point, why not have cores+2 number of threads (assuming that the payoff is greater than the cost of creating the threads?
In short,
Is there any sort of research on the "optimal" number of threads to use when running multi-threaded processes?
