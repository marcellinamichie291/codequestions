# How to access sub-elements in current object within JavaScript/jQuery?


Above I have three banner elements that I want to mark as unread if they are clicked. I structured each banner so that they have a span element within a nested div as shown with the image below (the red dot comes from the span element):

My javascript for this function is the following code:

I am trying to add a class ".read-dot" to the ".dot" span element that will hide it. I would like to add this class to the ".dot" span element that is inside the div that the user would click on. Any help would be appreciated.
I tried accessing the this.$(".dot) to access the dot element of the current object that triggered the event, but I now see this syntax is incorrect. I am new to jQuery which is why I tried this; I also could not find the page most relevant to my question on the API doc.
