# sam_data gets transformed into NAs and numerical values when using merge_samples phyloseq

I have sam_data looking like this 
I want to use the merge_samples() command on the "genus".
I have tried with code looking like this:
merge_physeq <- merge_samples(physeq, "genus")
What happens now is I get several of the warnings:
In asMethod(object) : NAs introduced by coercion
And my sam_data ends up looking like this:

I think this is due to nature of the variable. the different genuses are factor variables. But all my other data is also changed. The lower taxonomic levels are not important after the merge so they can be removed.
