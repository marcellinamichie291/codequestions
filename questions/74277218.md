# What is the best code style for a long list of exceptions thrown by a method in Java?

When I have a fairly long list of exceptions thrown by a method like this:
public void longNameOfTheMethod() throws TheFirstVeryLongException, TheSecondVeryLongException {    
    // ... code 
} 

I need to move the list to the next line to improve the readability of the code.
The first way seems good:
public void longNameOfTheMethod()
    throws TheFirstVeryLongException, TheSecondVeryLongException {
    // ... code
}

But here it is difficult to understand where the signature of the method with the list of exceptions ends and the body of the method begins. To fix this, I can do the second way:
public void longNameOfTheMethod()  
    throws TheFirstVeryLongException, TheSecondVeryLongException  
{  
    // ... code
}

But it's more like the C style, and it looks weird in Java.
What is the best way?
