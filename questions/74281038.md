# How to manage credentials for a shell script that uses AWS CLI?

I have a shell script that runs as part of a CloudFormation template for each new EC2 instance created in AWS account "A". As part of that script I'd like to create a new IAM role in a different AWS account, AWS account "B" (always the same account). I can write a script with the commands to do that, but how do I manage the credentials to account "B"?  I want to get the credentials when the script starts, run the aws commands and then remove any trace of credentials. I don't want the end users of those EC2 instances to have access to, or know, those credentials. And obviously not hardcode them nor place a credentials file somewhere publicly accessible.  This script will be public.
