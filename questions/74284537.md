# How do I get a specific element in array - MongoDB

Documents store in mongo db in following form
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("54fa059ce4b01b3e086c83e9"),
    "field1" : "value1",
    "field2" : "value2"
    "field3" : [ 
        {
            "abc123": ["somevalue", "somevalue"]
        },
        {
            "xyz345": ["somevalue", "somevalue"]
        }
    ]
}

What I want in output is whenever I pass abc123 in pymongo query I need result in following form
{
     "abc123": ["somevalue", "somevalue"]
}

or
["somevalue", "somevalue"]

Please suggest a mongo query for it. Thanks
