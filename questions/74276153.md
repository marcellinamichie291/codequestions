# How to do MATH with DERIVATIVE(mean("Field1"-"Field2"),1h).... ERROR: expected field argument in mean()

Trying to use a calculated field with derivative
 DERIVATIVE(mean("Field1"-"Field2"),1h)

results in InfluxDB Error: expected field argument in mean(), so I tried
DERIVATIVE(mean("Field1"-"Field2" AS "Field3"),1h) 

but that creates a parsing error: Found AS, expected )
DERIVATIVE works fine with a single field I just cant get it to work with a bit of MATH between two fields. Is this possible?
