# How do I access OPC DA using DCOM

I am getting the following error when I try to browse to the OPC Server.
Unable to cast COM object of type 'System._ComObject' to interface type '??.??'. This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID '{39C13A4D-011E-11D0-9675-0020AFD8ADB3}' failed due to the following error: A security package specific error occurred. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070721)
