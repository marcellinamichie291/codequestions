# Drawing staircases in a loop but not getting correct results

I am trying to draw 7 staircases with a loop but I have missed something and not sure why it's not working. It draws the first staircase and then goes completely off track and doesn't put the pen back down and I'm not sure why.
#Draw stairs 7 times
from turtle import*

#Stair repeat
for i in range (3):
    forward (25)
    left (90)
    forward(25)
    right(90)

#move to next stair
for i in range(7):
    penup()
    forward(25)
    right(90)
    forward(75)
    left(90)
    pendown()

My understanding is that the for loop would repeat the code, so if I want it to move for 7 separate stairs then the range is 7? This is obviously not correct though as it doesn't work. Hoping someone could point me in the correct direction as to why it's wrong.
