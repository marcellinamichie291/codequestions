# Using Mujoco in C++, trying to use mujoco with my C++ scripts

How to use mujoco in C++? I am very new to CMake and not very familiar with the linking and building with CMake.
I have tried the official documentation on building from source, and installed it.
what I have done:
    1.Clone the mujoco repository from GitHub.

    2.Create a new build directory somewhere, and cd into it.

    3.Run cmake $PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO to configure the build.

    4.Run cmake --build . to build.
    5. cmake --install .

I am confused of what to do next. What should I do in CMakeLists.txt so that I can include mujoco.h and glfw3.h in my C++ main() to work with my other C++ scripts.
I using CLion on MacOS with CMake.
Thanks in advance!
