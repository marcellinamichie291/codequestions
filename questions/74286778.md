# UITextView cursor jumps to the end when moving a cursor when text contains Korean

I'm currently debugging an editable UITextView (editable & not scrollable) inside a UIStackView contained inside a UIScrollView.
UIScrollView
 ∟ UIStackView(axis: .vertical, alignment: .fill)
    ∟ UITextView

The layout constraints of UITextView is set to hug the content and it seems to work fine.
The thing is, on some devices the cursor jumps back to the end of the text when ever I try to move.
I have confirmed that it works fine on the iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 but on iPhone 12 Pro, 13, 13 Pro works weird like this.

But when the content inside UITextView is only composed of latin alphabets, it works just fine.
At first, I've assumed that it may be related to auto layout or something, but seems to be more complicated than that.
TLDR

Cursor of UITextView jumps back to the end when I try to move it.

It only happens on the iPhone 11 but on iPhone 12 Pro, 13, 13 Pro.

If content is only in English or Numbers, it works fine. (Any single Korean letter inside breaks it.)

iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 works just fine. (both Korean and English)

Checked if there's any code that might be modifying content of UITextView or whether any delegate is set, but none have been found.

Nothing related to selectedRange found.
