# How to get the future nearest time in ruby

Suppose we have current time and then add the 60 munites to the current time.
Time.now + 1.hours
#2022-11-01 16:47:02.965861 +0500
after that we get the next half hour like 17:00:00
Sorry if i'm not able to convey my point, its my first posting at stack.
I'm able to get the previouse half hour time from this code, but unable to find the next houlf hour time.
time = Time.now - 30.minutes => 2022-11-01 15:22:59.942013 +0500 Time.at((time.to_time.to_i/1800).round * 1800).to_datetime => Tue, 01 Nov 2022 15:00:00 +0500
