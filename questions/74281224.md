# JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: Error while trying to convert string to dictionary

I have a txt file like this:
text='{"id": "a364ebd4", "reason": "delay", "description": "I bought a tv. It's not working and the manager said it was "the best" "}'
When I try to convert the string into a dict using json.loads()
textf = json.loads(text)
textf
I get the error JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 3290 (char 3289).
I think the problem is the quotation marks at "the best" but I don't know how to remove them without disturbing the quotation marks at "id","reason", etc., which I need to process the information.
