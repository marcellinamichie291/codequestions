# How to make sure user authenticates in Blazor when navigating to a page, but redirecting to that page after sign in?

I have successfully set up Azure ADB2C authentication with my Server-Blazor app.  Users can successfully login, but after that login, they are currently always redirected to the same (pre-configured) page/url.
What I actually want now, is the following logic:

A user navigates to a page (/registrationwizard/02, for example).
When the user is already signed in, the logic in that page just shows whatever is needed (I can do that with AuthorizeView)
But when the user is not yet signed in, the user should be redirected to the login logic, I currently do that with a <a href='MicrosoftIdentity/Account/SignIn'>sign in</a> link.
And after that sign in logic, the user should be returned back to the requested original page (/registrationwizard/02), and not the preconfigured page in the startup logic. (signin-oidc)

I did some searches, but cannot seem to find this (while I believe this should be rather straight forward?)
This is the (I believe) relevant part of my startup logic:
(have been trying to fiddle with the ReturnUrlParameter parameter as well)
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
        options =>
        {
            builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAdB2C", options);
            options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.CodeIdToken;
            options.Scope.Add("https://xxx.onmicrosoft.com/api/data");
            options.UseTokenLifetime = true;
            options.SaveTokens = true;
            // Played around with this parameter too
            options.ReturnUrlParameter = "returnUrl";
        }
        ,
        options =>
        {
            options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
            options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
            options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
        }
        );

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

Thanks
