how do I check which files are missing from the directory based on a txt of the files I should have?
E.G this is the list of files I should have

A
B
C
D
E
F
G
H
I

But in my directory I only have

A.npy
B.npy
C.npy
D.npy

So I want to do a script that can produce a result.txt like this:

A  [exists]
B  [exists]
C  [exists]
D  [exists]
E  [does not exist]
F  [does not exist]
G  [does not exist]
H  [does not exist]
I  [does not exist]

This is the script I have currently but it doesn't seem to work as it registers all files as "does not exist" :(
import os
import copy
import pandas as pd
import shutil
from pathlib import Path



# read training files.txt 
path_to_file = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/train_files_CS/all_training_CSmaster.txt'
path = 'xxxxxxxxxxx/train_files_CS'

# list of training npy files in directory
lof = []
for (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) in os.walk(path):
  lof.append(filenames)

lof = [x[:len(x) - 4] for x in lof[0] if x[0] == 'P']
#print(lof)

# new file to be written into
f = open('check_training.txt', 'w')

existing_files = 0
missing_files = 0

trfiles = []
with open(path_to_file) as file:
    for line in file:
        #print(line.rstrip())
        trfiles.append(line)
        
for x in trfiles:    
    if x in lof:
        existing_files+=1
        f.write(x)
        f.write("...[exists] \n")
    else:
        missing_files+=1
        f.write(x)
        f.write("  ...[doesn't exist] \n")
            
f.close()

print("\nthe missing files are:", missing_files,"\n")
print("the existing files are:",existing_files,"\n")

Any help is appreciated, thank you! :)
