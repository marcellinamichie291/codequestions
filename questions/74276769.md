# AWS ELB boto3 Pagination

screenshotI'm not able to describe all the ELB's although i used Pagination its only return ~34 while i have around 1400 Approx. can someone help me out?

import boto3
elb_client = boto3.client('elb', region_name = 'us-east-1')
paginator = elb_client.get_paginator('describe_load_balncers')
resp_iter = paginator.paginate()
for elbs in resp_iter:
   for elb in elbs['LoadBalancerDescriptions]:
      print(elb['LoadBalancerName'])

I have tried to run this code but only able to fetch 34 elbs, but i want to fetch all of the elbs.
