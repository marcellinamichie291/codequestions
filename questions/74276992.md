# Jenkins stage exited with code 1 and passing stage

in my pipeline one of the stage is exited with code 1 and still pipeline is passing. I want to fail the pipeline stage with exception when it is exiting with code 1.
Here is stage code:
stage('Stage A'){
  steps{
    script{
      container('A'){
        sh "$Command"
                def exitCode = sh 'echo $?'
                if (exitCode == 1) {
                     sh "exit 1"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
