# What does (a[i] = b[i]) != 0 mean in a c strcpy implementation?

I saw the above statement in a c string copy implementation. I assume it is assigning a[i] to b[i], and then check if a[i] is the termination character?

In which order does the above execute? Does it start with the not equal checking first or the assignment? And is it checking on array a or b?
Is it OK to write code in this compact way as this might cause confusion?
