# Google Cloud Functions: How to add <PROJECT_ID>.getIamPolicy permission to a service account?

When trying to deploy a Google Cloud Function with a Pub/Sub topic trigger, using this command:
gcloud functions deploy <FUNCTION_NAME> --runtime=ruby27 --entry-point=<FUNCTION_ENTRY_POINT> --region=us-east1 --source=. --trigger-topic=<PUBSUB_TOPIC_NAME> --gen2
I'm getting this error:
ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) User [<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>] does not have permission to access projects instance [<PROJECT_ID>:getIamPolicy] (or it may not exist): The caller does not have permission
I can't figure out how to grant the correct permission or role to the service account. I've given it "security Reviewer", which seems like it would cover getIamPolicy, judging by its description:

Security reviewer role, with permissions to get any IAM policy.

What am I getting wrong here?
I've tried adding the 'Security Reviewer' role, with various principals, including the runtime accounts, and my own account. I've also tried the Service Account User role.
