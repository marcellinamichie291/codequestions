# Visualise Class per Topics INSTEAD of Topics per Class in BERTopic

In the documentation for BERTopic here, there is a function to plot the frequency of classes for the selected topic. In the image below from the documentation, we see the frequency for each of classes when topic 17 is chosen (rec.sport.hockey is the most common class in topic 17)

Is there a way to visualise the opposite - the frequency of each topic for a given class? Example - how often each of the topics appear for the class rec.sport.hockey.
