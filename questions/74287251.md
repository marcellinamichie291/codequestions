i am currently working on an android application that is companion to a web site.
the user signs into both the android app and web site with the same username and password.
from the android app the user can click a list item which then navigates to the android device web browser to display the full details within the associated web site.
the user may have to sign into the web site before they can view the details of the clicked on list item.
is the anyway i can reduce the "friction" of this user experience?
if i saved the user app credentials in the android devices google accounts would this be made available to the user when they navigate to the associated web site?
could i use One Tap Sign In to sign the user into the associated web site?
