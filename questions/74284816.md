Not able to integrate Azure IoT SDK in ESP-IDF
Hello guys, I am trying to use Azure IoT SDK with ESP-IDF.I follow the steps for this to that:

Download Azure IoT SDK from link: https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-middleware-freertos
Then I pasted that file inside my C-drive.
Create a ESP32 Project and put location of Azure-IoT SDK in CMakeLists file


But, during compilation I am getting an error. That means I am not able integrate that SDK with ESP-IDF. If any solution is there to include that SDK in ESP-IDF please tell me the procedure.
