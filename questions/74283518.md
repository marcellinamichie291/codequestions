# How to limit Bootstrap 5 container max width with SASS?

I'm Kevin a backend programmer.
I'm new at front end and trying bootstrap,
if you look at Bootstrap 5 documentation:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/
there's a responsive table for container.
But I want it to be like this (see my red mark):

Basically I want to limit the width to 960px no matter big the screen sizes are.
If possible I want to change Bootstrap SASS configuration rather than writing my own CSS. (which is recommended by Bootstrap)
Thank you,
Best regards
Edit: I'm using ruby on rails. command: rails new -c bootstrap
