# Security Audit failed due to malloc function use in FirebaseCoreDiagnostics

We have used a ML model for image identification for iOS but when we have submitted the application to VAPT. They have rejected due to use of malloc function. We have validated where it's occuring so we found that it's in the one of the used pods.
Now we have decided to migrate the application to ml kit but that also has malloc function so expecting and update from google dev support if any security risk due that or it's fine.
If there is any solution or clarification which mention about no security threat.
