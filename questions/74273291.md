# Spring authorization server login page on client side

I'm trying the new spring authorization server and I want to keep the login form on my angular application, then I send the username/password to my spring boot client application and then I want it to use the usual flow to connect to the authorization server.
Auth server
    @Bean
    @Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)
    public SecurityFilterChain authServerSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration.applyDefaultSecurity(http);

        http
                .exceptionHandling((exceptions) -> exceptions
                        .authenticationEntryPoint(
                                new LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint("/login"))
                );

        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    @Order(2)
    public SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http)
            throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                );

        return http.build();
    }

Spring client side
    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
          .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests ->
            authorizeRequests.anyRequest().authenticated()
          )
          .oauth2Login(oauth2Login ->
            oauth2Login.loginPage("/oauth2/authorization/articles-client-oidc"))
          .oauth2Client(withDefaults());
        return http.build();
    }

Then I have my application yml with all the configuration, What I want at this point is to intercept the call sent by my angular app to this spring client, and then do the flow from here... How should I change my client config in order to make it work? Implement a filter I suppose, but can't figure out how. Thx
