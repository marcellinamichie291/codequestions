# Forward imputation in tensorflow

As a minimal example, say I have a tensor of the form:
[[ 1.   0.   3. ]
 [ 7.   5.   6. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.  11.   1. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0. ]
 [13.  14.  16.5]]

Is there a way (natively in tensorflow) to impute the fully zeroed rows such their values are assigned to be equal to the last non-fully zeroed row? I.e. ->:
[[ 1.   0.   3. ]
 [ 7.   5.   6. ]
 [ 7.   5.   6. ]
 [ 0.  11.   1. ]
 [ 0.  11.   1. ]
 [ 0.  11.   1. ]
 [13.  14.  16.5]]

I thought about using tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update but with no success.
