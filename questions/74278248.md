# How to configure Azure AD B2C tenant using Terraform?

I am trying to setup Azure AD B2C instance (having very simple configuration for testing purposes) using Infrastructure as Code tools - Terraform for now. I am IaC newbie, so excuse me if you find this question dumb. I'd like to automatically add few identity providers to my configuration, but also a user flow. According to the docs, I've found out I could use azurerm_api_management_identity_provider_aadb2c to configure the IP's, however I can't see anything related to user flows in the official Azure provider documentation in the Terraform registry. Does it mean I can't configure user-flows using Terraform until I do not write my own provider? :) How then I might automatically configure these resources?? If I could not automate this - for me it makes no sense at all to involve IaC tools in the project Maybe it has a little benefit, but to reach full potential I assume, it needs to run the whole infrastructure on demand using the scripts - which won't happen if I omit any configuration etc.
Thanks in advance for any help.
Regards
