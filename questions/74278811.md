# OPENUI5 height for scroll container rendered dynamically

inside a ScrollContainer i placed a Carousel that created different carousel-items with dynamic height (show 3 content div as default). The problem is that my carousel container height is set to the height of the highest item-content (height = 2000px), therefore i can scroll down to the page even if my content div height is around 600px.
How i can avoid such a behavior.
<ScrollContainer vertical="true" horizontal="false" height="100%" width="100%">
   <Carousel
     showPageIndicator="false"
     width="100%">
