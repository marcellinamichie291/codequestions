# How does Subversion calculate L2P-INDEX and P2L-INDEX checksums?

What data is used in the hashing, and which hashing algorithm is used (SHA-1, MD5)?
I would like to overcome this checksum error that occurs when I do the svnadmin verify command.
* Error verifying repository metadata.
svnadmin: E200014: L2P index checksum mismatch in file [path here]:
   expected:  9cf77860c47fb5e312f51e699342b957
     actual:  7b706920c703aae25120911c4d90d7aa

I can see the "expected" is the one that is stored in the file. I see it there clearly when viewing the revs file in a text editor or hex editor. So "actual" must be the freshly calculated checksum.
I have tried hashing various byte ranges after L2P-INDEX, using both SHA-1 and MD5, but I haven't come up with a match yet.
For reference, here are the full contents of the revs file in a text editor and hex editor. The L2P and P2L index checksums are the hex strings near the end. I'm working with a modified "empty" revision.
