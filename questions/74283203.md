# How to filter a dataframe with multiple-dimension index based on one dimension

I have a dataframe with multiple dimensional index using pandas. Say employee_id and date. Now I want to update records that's prior to a specific date, say 2020-01-01. To be consistent with other codes, the update was made using np.where. So how can I add this date filter into this assignment, df['Sale'] = np.where(df.sale_actual>df.sale_expect, df.sale_actual, df.sale_expect). Thanks.
