# How to replace jar internal dependencies when submitting spark submit

I want to replace the library containing the business logic used in the application when submitting spark submit.

For example, I would like to replace the test v1.1.1 internal library that is being used in project "A" with test v2.2.2 upon spark submit.
spark-submit
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
  --jars "$TEST_JARS_V2.2.2" \
  --name $APP_NAME \
  --master yarn \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --verbose \
  --class AAA.AAA.batch.EntryPoint \
  /.../.../A.jar(exclude test dependency)

sbt
"?.?.?" %% "test" % "1.1.1" % Provided

In this first way
I registered the internal library test v1.1.1 as "Provided" in project A, excluded it from the fat jar, and injected test library  v2.2.2 through spark submit --jars.
But it seems that the test library cannot be injected.
The classes in the test library were not found.
Please advise if I did something wrong.
