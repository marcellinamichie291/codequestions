# How to return a default msg when there's no json key value

I am running the following query:
select id, products::jsonb ->'price_p' -> 'value' as total_price from tb

But sometimes the record dont't have price_p key in the jsonb column.  How can I return a msg like no price_p key found when there is no price_p in the json?
employee_nps": {"value": ["7"]}
example:
id     products
1    {"price_p":{"value": ["10"]}}
2    {"net_price":{"value":["12.30"]}}

would return:
1     10
2 "no price_p"
