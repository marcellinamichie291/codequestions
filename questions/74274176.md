# How to get CSS media attributes to work on mobile devices?

I have written some HTML and CSS for a website, and some media queries to reformat the code when the screen shrinks. This works on browsers, when I shrink the browser window size, but isn't working on mobile devices. Can anyone think of why? See the Media CSS below:
@media screen and (max-width:500px) {
  #education-table td {
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
  }
}

Thanks in advance!
I have looked at similar issues and thus added the "screen and", but this has not fixed the issue,
