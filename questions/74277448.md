I need to find the sum of all elements in an ArrayList that are divisible by 2 or 3.
My code is throwing a runtime error:


Exception in thread  main  java.lang.NumberFormatException: null
    at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:542)
    at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615)
    at Runner.main(Runner.java:57)

Can someone help me find the error?
This is my code:


public class Solution {
public static int findSum(int n, ArrayList<Integer> arr) {

    // Write your code here
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(arr.get(i)%2 == 0 || arr.get(i)%3 == 0)
            sum += (int)arr.get(i);
    }
    return sum;
}

}
