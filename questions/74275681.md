# How can I populate the "code" column for a VS Code problem created by my extension?

My VS Code extension creates custom "problems".
I am using the following code to create the vscode.Diagnostic
let diagnostic = new vscode.Diagnostic(
    rangeObject,
    `${fullMsg}`,
    vscode.DiagnosticSeverity.Error);
diagnostic.code = 123;

and I expected that the 123 would show up in the "code" column of the VS Code problems window when it is in "view as table" mode.  But this is not the case, I always see a "-" in that column.
Is it possible to populate this column?
