# Adding one-time decorative animation to react component (use state or not?)

I want to add a one-shot animation to a React component. When the user clicks a button, I want an icon to fly from there to a certain spot and then disappear. I would use a HTML element and animate it with CSS animations, but I'm not sure how to structure it beyond that.
I have a couple of alternatives:

Render the icon unconditionally, and show/hide it outside of React with css (this seems wrong)

Control the appearance via state, but then I need a timer and have to trigger a rerender after the animation is complete. Something like:
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false);


Keep it completely out of React. Create a function that adds the icon element to the root of the document, starts the animation, and after some time removes the element. Then just call this in my button callback.


I am leaning to the last option, since my application already has non-react parts (it embeds the React components inside another framework). And it seems wrong to add state and trigger a re-render for something that is visually outside of the component, and is basically just visual flourish. Is there anything I have to consider or should it just work?
