# use background fetch or silent notification

I want to build an application that will check the amount of internet disconnections every hour
That's why I need the application to run in the background (even in terminated mode) and check every minute if there is an Internet connection.
I saw that there are 2 options to wake the application in the terminated state

background fetch
silent notification

My question is which one to use, and is it even possible to trigger the application every minute you check if there is internet?
