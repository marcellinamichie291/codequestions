# R: How to count frequency of combinations between two string columns (using dplyr, tidyr, or base r)

I have a large data frame of station-to-station bike trips and it is my goal to identify the most common combinations of start and end stations. My df looks like this:
df <- data.frame(start_station = c('Apple', 'Bungalow', 'Carrot', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Bungalow'),
                 end_station = c('Bungalow', 'Apple', 'Carrot', 'Bungalow', 'Bungalow', 'Apple'),
                 start_lat = c(12.3456, 23.4567, 34.5678, 12.3456, 12.3456, 23.4567),
                 start_lng = c(09.8765, 98.7654, 87.6543, 09.8765, 09.8765, 98.7654)
)

Ideally, I want an output that creates a ranked list of station combinations in descending order of frequency and a new column, 'ride_count' that reflects the number of exact combinations.
In the above example, I want the output to be a new dataframe I can further manipulate/visualize
start_station   end_station   ride_count start_lat   start_lng
Apple            Bungalow      3          12.3456    09.8765
Bungalow         Apple         2          23.4567    98.7654
Carrot           Carrot        1          34.5678    87.6543

Per a previous recommendation, the 'count()' command does perform the correct calculation, however I lose the other data associated with each station, like start_lat and start_lng.
Is there a way to preserve these columns?
A sincere thanks to anyone for their assistance. I've been plowing through this project efficiently, but I'm really struggling with this final geographic element.
