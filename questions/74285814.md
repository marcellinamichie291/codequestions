I have real data consisting of 3 input variables and 2 output variables. I have used a linear regression model of deep learning to predict the outputs for given inputs and it works pretty well. Now my question is how can I find the minimum value of outputs? I want to also know the values of inputs at which these minimum values occur. How can I do it?
