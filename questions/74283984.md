# Setting a parameter once and use it multiple times in python

I'm new to Python and I have a design question. I have a file in this structure:
@pytest.fixture( scope = "module", autouse = True )
def auth( input ) :
  body = {
           name= "secret"
           type="A"
         }
.
.
.

class TestArtifacts(object):
     def test_e2e( self, input):
     name = "secret"
.
.
.

    def test_e2e_2( self, input):
     name = "secret"
.
.
.
.

In my code, I've set the value of the variable name multiple times in more than one function. I want to read the name value from a JSON file once and use it here instead of a hardcoded value. My question is how I can read and set the parameter once and then re-use the value. Where is the best place to put this parameter?
EDIT: Can defining another @pytest.fixture to read the value of the name variable from a JSON file and return it, be a good approach in this scenario?
