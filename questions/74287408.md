# equivalent of navigator.bluetooth.requestdevice() in react native

I am converting a vanilla project into react native and got stuck in this finding equvalent of navigator.bluetooth.requestdevice() in react native
I have tried packages like https://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager but the problem is I have the code of that web project and finding this alternative can slove many tasks.
