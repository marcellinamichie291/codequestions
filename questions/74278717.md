# How to Covert Ntile Over partition by in MySQL into Pandas groupby and qcut

In MySQL , I have a table with these columns:
A,B, C, D, E, F,G,H,I
I have this code that create 10 partitions/ over the table:
   
 SELECT
      A, AVG(B), 
        NTILE(10) OVER (partition by C, D, E, F,G,H
          ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT I) DESC) as decile_volume,
      C, D, E, F,G,H
FROM TABLE


I want to convert this query to pandas code:
I created the table in pandas as dataframe(df).
I am trying this code but I don't not get the result what I want :

     goubpby_columns = [C, D, E, F,G,H]

     df_new = df.groupby(groupby_columns).transform (lambda x : pd.qcut(x,10, duplicate ='drop'))


Any suggestion would be appreciated
Thanks,
