# Edit product / item cost manually in Woocommerce order backend

I would like to manually change product price from the Woocommerce edit order page. The "pencil" next to product line only enables to edit the total price field, quantity and Tax, not the item cost. I need to change the item cost for each customer.
It is the same question as this thread:
Woocommerce: How to change the item cost when editing orders?
But without solution.
And here there is a clue here:
Change Order item prices in Woocommerce 3
but I don't know how to use it. Tried to paste it in functions.php but Wordpress gives an error message.
Regards
