# I want to plot a graph from a csv file using C++. Is there a recommended IDE to use for this and what are the extensions/libraries needed for this?

I have a year worth of foreign currency exchange data and I want to use this csv file to output a line chart using C++. 1st column is the date, 2nd is the domestic currency value.
I've been looking for answers for the past days but there is no tutorials for C++. I'm not sure if I can integrate it with Python. Please explain like I'm a newbie I am new to this. Thank you!
