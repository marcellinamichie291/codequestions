# Split data across worksheets is losing the formula when running

Novice here but have found and been using the VBA code below to split data from one worksheet across multiple sheets wherever there is a difference in a nominated column. For example - if Column A has:
NAME
Person A
Person B
Person C
The VBA would create a 'Person A' worksheet which contains all info from the master sheet table, then create a 'Person B' worksheet, etc.
The issue I have is that I want to copy formulas from the master sheet to all the created worksheet as I a using a HYPERLINK based on a cell reference which doesn't work on the created sheets at the moment. I have tried tinkering myself but not getting very far and all other posts I see are trying to NOT copy formulas. I am guessing that it is something to do with the 'Transpose' function, or the use of "SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants))" but I am stumped.
Ideally each new worksheet would contain the same formula and formatting as the master - so if I were to format the data as a table on the master sheet each new worksheet would have the same table format including all formulas and have filters active.
Is this all possible and if so, what needs changing to get this to work?

VBA

Sub parse_data()
        Dim lr As Long
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Dim vcol, i As Integer
        Dim icol As Long
        Dim myarr As Variant
        Dim title As String
        Dim titlerow As Integer

     Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    vcol = Application.InputBox(prompt:="Which column would you like to filter by?", title:="Filter column", Default:="6", Type:=1)
    Set ws = ActiveSheet
    lr = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, vcol).End(xlUp).Row
    title = "A1"
    titlerow = ws.Range(title).Cells(1).Row
    icol = ws.Columns.Count
    ws.Cells(1, icol) = "Unique"
    For i = 2 To lr
        On Error Resume Next
        If ws.Cells(i, vcol) <> "" And Application.WorksheetFunction.Match(ws.Cells(i, vcol), ws.Columns(icol), 0) = 0 Then
            ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, icol).End(xlUp).Offset(1) = ws.Cells(i, vcol)
        End If
    Next

    myarr = Application.WorksheetFunction.Transpose(ws.Columns(icol).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants))
    ws.Columns(icol).Clear

    For i = 2 To UBound(myarr)
        ws.Range(title).AutoFilter field:=vcol, Criteria1:=myarr(i) & ""
        If Not Evaluate("=ISREF('" & myarr(i) & "'!A1)") Then
            Sheets.Add(after:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)).Name = myarr(i) & ""
        Else
            Sheets(myarr(i) & "").Move after:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)
        End If
        ws.Range("A" & titlerow & ":A" & lr).EntireRow.Copy Sheets(myarr(i) & "").Range("A1")
        'Sheets(myarr(i) & "").Columns.AutoFit
    Next

    ws.AutoFilterMode = False
    ws.Activate
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    End Sub

Tried editing various parts but often only ended up with one new worksheet, blank worksheets or nothing at all.
