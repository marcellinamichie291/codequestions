# How can I count occurrences of words specified in an array in Python?

I am working on a small program in which the user enters text and I would like to check how many times the given words occur in the given input.
# Read user input
print("Input your code: \n")

user_input = sys.stdin.read()
print(user_input)

For example, the text that I input in a program is:
a=1
b=3
if (a == 1):
    print("A is a number 1")
elif(b == 3):
    print ("B is 3")
else: 
    print("A isn't 1 and B isn't 3")

The words to find out are specified in an array.
wordsToFind = ["if", "elif", "else", "for", "while"]

And basically I would like to print how many "if", "elif" and "else" has occurred in a input.
How can I count occurrences of words like "if", "elif", "else", "for", "while" in a given string by user input?
