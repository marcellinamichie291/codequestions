# Cypress verify API request

I want to verify if the API request contains what it needs to contain, but not sure what I am doing wrong as I have always this error:
cy.wait() timed out waiting 5000ms for the 1st request to the route: apiCheck. No request ever occurred.

I have a link in the main menu, after clicking that link the new page opens and API call is iniciated immediately http://localhost:8081/currencies
So in Cypress I have this:
 cy.get('ul li[title="Menu item"]>a').click();

  cy.intercept({
        method: 'GET',
        url: '/currencies',
      }).as('apiCheck')

      cy.wait('@apiCheck').then((interception) => {
        expect(interception.response.status).to.equal(200);
        assert.isNotNull(interception.response.body, 'geographyName')
      })

As you can see from Cypress test runner screenshot, the request is there and has status 200, but still it says no request ever occurred.
