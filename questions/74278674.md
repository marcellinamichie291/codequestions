# CS50: I can't make my page show me the hompage, it says there is no such table "transaction"

I have changed several times my code and the html file but I still can't solve it :( i really have no idea about what else should i doon getting the index function to work in finance cs50! This function should return in an html page a table with the details of my transactions... this is my app.py:
def index():

    """Show portfolio of stocks"""
    id = session["user_id"]
    stocks = db.execute(
        "SELECT stock_name, SUM(shares), stock_symbol FROM transactions GROUP BY stock_name HAVING user_id = ?", id)
    portfolio = [0]
    for stock in stocks:
        stock_name = stock["stock_name"]
        stock_symbol = stock["stock_symbol"]
        shares = stock["SUM(shares)"]
        quote = lookup(stock_symbol)
        current_price = quote["price"]
        shares_value = current_price*shares
        portfolio.append([stock_name, stock_symbol, shares, current_price, shares_value])
    return render_template("index.html", portfolio = portfolio)

this is my "index.html"
{% extends "layout.html" %}

    {% block title %}
        Stocks
    {% endblock %}

    {% block main %}
    <h2>Your portfolio</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Stock Name</th>
                <th>Stock Symbol</th>
                <th>Total Shares</th>
                <th>Current Stock Price</th>
                <th>Total Shares Value</th>



            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for stock in portfolio %}
                <tr>
                    <td>{{ stock.stock_name }}</td>
                    <td>{{ stock.stock_symbol }}</td>
                    <td>{{ stock.shares }}</td>
                    <td>{{ stock.current_price }}</td>
                    <td>{{ stock.shares_value }}</td>
                </tr>
            {% endfor %}
