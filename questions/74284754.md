# <web-app> tag in web.xml file can't be declared, why?

I was following different tutorials and maven created everything by his own. I tried to configure this file following book advice and videos. Unfortunately, program docent like something in my case. How can I fix it? (Tomcat is downloaded and works correctly)

Followed various instructions but couldn't find the solution. Program writes that  tag should be declared
