# How to read variables from file, with multiple variables per line?

I'm trying to read from a file, that has multiple lines, each with 3 informations I want to assign to the variables and work with.
I figured out, how to simply display them each on the terminal, but can't figure out how to actually assign them to variables.
while read i
do
  for j in $i
  do
    echo $j
  done
done < ./test.txt

test.txt:
1 2 3
a b c

So I want to read the line in the outer loop, then assign the 3 variables and then work with them, before going to the next line.
I'm guessing I have to read the values of the lines without an inside loop, but I can't figure it out right now.
Hope someone can point me in the right direction.
