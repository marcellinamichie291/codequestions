I am creating a game library (C#) that I then intend to use in Unity as a .dll-file. My reasoning for this is to completely detach the logic and data of the game itself (such as world generation and world loading/saving) from Unity, and just dish Unity data that the library handles.
I am storing data as JSON files, and can already read these from my drive. How can I read these files if they are stored within the library itself? For example, Directory.GetParent(Environment.CurrentDirectory).Parent.FullName does not work, since if I use the library in another project, it just references the bin-folder of that project instead of the library.
To clarify: I am not asking how to read files or how to parse these files. Simply how to find these files to be read inside .dll files, or if that is even possible at all.
