# Adding real-world lighting to RealityKit's VideoMaterial

I am using VideoMaterial material on mesh: plane in RealityKit to play video over an object in AR. This works easily, but I would like the video to change brightness based on the real world lighting. I thought this is done automatically, but with the VideoMaterial it doesn't work. Can you please advice me whether it's possible to do this?
