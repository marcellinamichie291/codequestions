# Python noob question. Looping through all to find correct combination

Sorry for noob question. Just started learning coding with Python - beginners level.
Wasn't able to find in the net what I require.
Creating function to loop through the entire line, in order to find right combination - 7,8,9 - regardless of input length and of target position, and return 'true' if found. Wasn't able to devise the function correctly. Not sure how to devise function clearly and at all this far.
Your help is much appreciated.
This is what I came up with so far (not working of course):
def _11(n):
    for loop in range(len(n)):
        if n[loop]==[7,8,9]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
print(_11([1000,10,11,34,67,89,334,5567,6534,765,2,3,5,6,112,7,8,9,11111]))

It always returns False. Tried with (*n) to no avail.
