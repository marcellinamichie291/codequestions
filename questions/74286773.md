# The right usage of braces within arrow function within Array.prototype.filter

(function (){
  console.log([0, 1, 2, 3].filter(i => {i % 2 == 0}));
})();
// Array[]

I want to print an array that contains only even numbers, that is 0 and 2 in the case above. Array.prototype.filter along with an arrow function are used for this purpose.
The above code returns an empty array. However, if I remove braces, the code works as expected.
(function (){
  console.log([0, 1, 2, 3].filter(i => i % 2 == 0));
})();
// Array[0, 2]

Can someone explain why it happens? I always used arrow functions with braces and they worked just fine but it seems to me that there are caveats.
