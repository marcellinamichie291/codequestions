# constructing enums using Z=> with variables instead of list literals

I would like to construct a String-typed enum.  The following works:
my Str enum E ( <a b c> Z=> 'one', 'two', 'three' );
E.kv.raku.say;


("c", "three", "a", "one", "b", "two").Seq

However, trying the following does not:
my Str @a = <a b c>;
my Str @b = <one two three>;
my Str enum F ( @a Z=> @b );
F.kv.raku.say;


No values supplied to enum (does  @a Z=> @b  need to be declared constant?)

Is this not supported?
Raku/roast covers enum construction like in E but I didn't see any test cases for F.
Out of curiosity, I also tried:
my $a = <a b c>;
my $b = <one two three>;
my Str enum G ( $a<> Z=> $b<>.map( { .Str } ) );
G.kv.raku.say;


("", "").Seq
