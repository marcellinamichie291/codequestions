# Header is not allowed as both an origin custom header and a forward header

I am trying to create a new origin in an existing Cloudfront distribution that will point to an S3 bucket. One of the other origins of the distribution is pointing to a service and it has a custom header that is forwarding to the service to verify that the request is coming from Cloudfront. The problem is that when I try to create new origin, I am getting the following error:

Any idea what maybe the source of the problem?
