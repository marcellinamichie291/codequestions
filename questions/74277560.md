# Bubble layout in React Native

I want a layout like this

but I was not able to figure out how to make this layout and thus was able to create something like this- 
I used flex-direction : 'row' and flex-wrap : 'wrap' , and also used the Math.random() for variable height and width but was not able to achieve the layout above.
If there is something I am missing or is there any library for that , it will be very helppfull.
