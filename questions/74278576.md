# Scrape data from a paginated website which was blocking the request when i use beautifulsoup, selenium

I want to scrape data from this site "https://www.findhelp.org/care/support-network--san-francisco-ca?postal=94105" . I Tried using selenium, beautifulsoup but cant able to scrape the data because the site was blocking scrapers. I want to find a way to scrape the data in this site.
Any solution for this problem will be highly appreciated.
I tried these two approaches:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url="https://www.findhelp.org/care/support-network--san-francisco-ca?postal=94105"

headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.246'}
reqs = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(reqs.text, 'lxml')
print(soup)

Second one:
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
#object of Options class
op = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
#add user Agent
op.add_argument("user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.246")
#set chromedriver.exe path
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r"C:\Users\Vinay Edula\Desktop\evva\findhelp\chromedriver.exe",options=op)
#maximize browser
driver.maximize_window()
#launch URL
driver.get("https://www.findhelp.org/search_results/94105")
time.sleep(15)
driver.quit()
