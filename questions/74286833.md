# WooCommerce - A way of clearing the applied coupons from the current session

When a customer completes an order, I need a way of removing the applied coupons so that when they checkout again, the same coupons aren't applied.
I can't set the coupon to be one use only so I need a method to remove the applied coupons programatically.
