The question asks us to find the range and coefficient of n data. Range is the largest numbers(L) smallest number(s) and coefficient is L-S/L+S.
My code

e=int(input('Enter the number of elements'))
for i in range(0,e):
    i=int(input('enter the number'))
    if i>i:
        h=i
    if i<i:
        l=i
print('Range=',h-l)
print('Coefficient=',(h-l)/(h+l))


The error I get is that h is not defined. What's wrong with my code?
