# Oracle instant client inside Firebase functions

Im trying to setup an oracledb connection with firebase functions, as seen in this f√≥rum : Access Oracle database from react native(firebase cloud functions).
I followed Frank, that had the kindness to help me, but i could get only so far as to make it work in development, because there is a problem with oracle instant client and firebase functions. In localhost, the functions read the binaries no problem but when i deploy i get the error:
Error: DPI-1047: Cannot locate a 64-bit Oracle Client library: "libclntsh.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". See https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/INSTALL.html for help Node-oracledb installation instructions: https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/INSTALL.html You must have 64-bit Oracle Client libraries configured with ldconfig, or in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you do not have Oracle Database on this computer, then install the Instant Client Basic or Basic Light package from https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5) at async /workspace/lib/index.js:43:28 at async /layers/google.nodejs.yarn/yarn_modules/node_modules/firebase-functions/lib/common/providers/https.js:411:26 { errorNum: 0, offset: 0 }
Do i have any workaround in firebase functions or i really have to migrate to another solution?
Thanks for helping!
I tried putting the instantclient folder in like all places inside functions, tried to make a https.onRequest call, but nothing works
