# Snapml Not installing on windows

For a ML project on credit-card (ML with python coursera) I needed to import snapml. But unfortunately in pip install module its not unstalling.
Its showing -" error could not find a version that satisfies the requirement snapml"
and "error no matching distribuition found for snapml"
I also tried .whl file which also isnt working.
What should I do fix the issues?
Tried to install and didnt work
