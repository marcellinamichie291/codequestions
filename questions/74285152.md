# in a m to n table between PKs of table A and B. how to find a PK of A that has a specific set of entries with PKs of B in the m to n table

Given the two tables teacher and student,
table : teacher
+-------+-----------+
|   id  |   name    |
+-------+-----------+
|   1   |   John    |
|   2   |   Mary    |
|   3   |   Jeff    |
|   4   |   Bill    |
|   5   |   Bob     |
|   6   |   Frieda  |
+-------+-----------+

table : student
+-------+-----------+
|   id  |   name    |
+-------+-----------+
|   1   |   mario   |
|   2   |   lisa    |
|   3   |   anna    |
|   4   |   sara    |
|   5   |   felix   |
+-------+-----------+

and the m to n relationship between them
table : teacherStudent
+---------+---------+
|teacherId|studentId|
+---------+---------+
|   1     |   1     |
|   1     |   2     |
|   1     |   3     |
|   3     |   1     |
|   3     |   5     |
|   4     |   4     |
|   4     |   5     |
|   5     |   1     |
|   5     |   2     |
|   5     |   3     |
|   6     |   1     |
|   6     |   2     |
|   6     |   3     |
|   6     |   4     |
+---------+---------+
