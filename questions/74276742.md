# Can I use new React Native architecture with libraries which doesn't support it

This year React Native team introduced new architecture https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/03/15/an-update-on-the-new-architecture-rollout. This functionality is still under the flag but for me is not clear, can I use all libraries which working with old bridge with this new architecture?
I haven't found answer in the official documentation. Only thig I found is a list of libraries which support new architecture. https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/6
