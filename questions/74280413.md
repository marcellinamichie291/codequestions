# Type check two dimensional vector values based on enum method arguments

I have two enums and a key-value store. The key for the first level of the store is Enum1 and the key for the second level is Enum2 as seen below.
enum A { a, b }
enum B { c, d }

const MODEL: { [key in A]?: { [key in B]?: string } = {
  [A.a]: {
    [B.c]: "test"
  }
}

I want to create a method type signature that validates whether the combination of enums is valid.
I assume this would look something like below:
const myMethod = <E1 extends A, E2 extends B>(
  arg1: E1,
  arg2: E2,
  value: (typeof MODEL)[E1][E2] // This is where I have issues
// Error message: Type 'B' cannot be used to index type <big object type redacted>
)

The example above has been heavily simplified. The specific use case above may seem redundant/unrealistic but the core logic is what I need to clarify.
As a result, based on the above supplied MODEL variable, the following would be the expected outcomes:
myMethod(A.a, B.c, "test") // no error, as it exists in model
myMethod(A.a, B.d, "test") // error, combination does not exist in model
myMethod(A.a, B.c, "result") // error, value not exist in model
