I'm confused on how to manage SEO for client components in Next.js 13.
Let's say I want to create a contact us page at /contact
In the new framework, I should create a folder named contact inside the app directory. And in it I should create a page called page.js by convention.
Now I need to create a form, which of course needs to manage its state. Thus I should use useState or other hooks from react.
But when I do that, Next.js compiler complains that it's a server component and if I want to use it on the client-side, I should mark it with 'use client' directive at the top.
But I don't want the component to be rendered on the client-side. I need my /contact page to be indexed by search engines.
What should I do?
