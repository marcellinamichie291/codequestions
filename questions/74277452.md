# Creating a link in SAS EG

I have been unable to find any documentation on creating links in a SAS EG process flow.
Here is an example what I mean by link:

The ones with the dotted lines are created by right clicking and pressing create a link.
But what do they do? my guess is they make one program run after the data it is linked to is created but I am not sure. What are they used for and is there any consequence for using them?
Thank you in advance.
