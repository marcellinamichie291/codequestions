# jupyter lab becomes very lagging after machine learning with a lot of data when using JupyterDash

I am using JupyterDash and use Jupyter Lab to edit and run the file. When opening it the first time, it is running well, however after doing machine learning with a lot of data, jupyter lab becomes very lagging. Even I closed the browser and closed anaconda prompt and re-logged into jupyter lab, it still is lagging a lot.
so I think it is related to memory in the browser?
I don't use dcc.Store() since my data is more than 10MB. I just pass the data in callback to the function.
Here is what I used.  Thanks for your help.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(mode='external',debug=True,port=8050)
