# Google Sheets API - Import all named Ranges

I have a google sheet with several named ranges.
I would like to import every single named range in the sheet and save them as individual objects named after the named range.
Furthermore, there are 4 similar blocks of data. Therefore the names of the ranges are structured like "block1_name1" "block1_name2" "block2_name1" "block2_name2" etc.
With the following code I can enter every range manually, but there are too many to enter them all manually:

const API_KEY = "###"; // Please set your API key.

const ID = "###"; // Please set your Spreadsheet ID.

const RANGE = ["Range1", "Range2"]; // Named ranges

const ranges = RANGE.map(e => `ranges=${encodeURIComponent(e)}`).join("&");

const response = await fetch(`https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${ID}/values:batchGet?key=${API_KEY}&${ranges}`);

const { valueRanges } = await response.json();

const obj = valueRanges.reduce((o, { values }, i) => (o[RANGE[i]] = values, o), {});

console.log(obj);


How can I import every named range automatically?
How can I save them as a different objects for each datablock like block1.name1 etc?
