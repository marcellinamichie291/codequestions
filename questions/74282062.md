# Canâ€™t Retrieve Session in Rails API

So I've decided to go with Rails as the backend solution for a new project I'm currently working on (the frontend is built with SvelteKit).
I got the user sign-up & login flows working with the good old rails sessions (had to jump through the hoops of adding the sessions mechanism to an api_only rails skeleton, which was a surprisingly challenging task).
The Session Cookie, along with a CSRK-Token, is now saved in the browser on every successful login attempt and gets sent to the backend on each following request.
I've created a simple SvelteKit hook that runs on every request. it verifies if the session cookie exists. if not - resolves the request, and if it does - tries to fetch the user from Rails based on the session.
All that said, I just can't find a way to retrieve the session in rails (session[:user_id]). I'm using it in a CurrentUser concern, yet it's always empty.
I do get the value of request.session_options[:id] somehow, yet it's encrypted and i can't use it to find a user id.
Here's a gist of all relevant files: https://gist.github.com/n00ki/fdd82460c43f2c47d855110bc68f4510
I'd really appreciate any kind of help, I'm about to lose my mind over this one ðŸ˜¦
Thanks a lot in advance!!
