# Running a background task with react native(IOS,Android)

everyone good works.
I want to create a task in the background in React Native.
I am using react-native-background-task for this.
But I couldn't get it to work. Below are the code blocks I used.
If you have any other library suggestions, I would be happy if you share them.
I also set AndroidManifest, MainActivity and MainApplication settings without any problems.
Thank you.
import BackgroundTask from 'react-native-background-task';

BackgroundTask.define(async () => {
  console.log('************************************Hello from a background task');
  await ReadWriteContacts();
  BackgroundTask.finish()
});

const App = () => {
 BackgroundTask.schedule({
    period: 100, 
  });
}

export default App;
