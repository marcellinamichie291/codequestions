# imagettftext() in php is not mixing char in devanagari

I am trying to write text in devanagari on image. But some characters are not mixing. For example

If we have to write 'प्रवेश' in devanagari on image
we are getting प् रवेः

Below is my code
$name = 'प्रवेशः';
$image = imagecreatefromjpeg('image.jpeg');
  $font_path ='./NotoSansDevanagari-VariableFont_wdth_wght.ttf';
  $red_color = imagecolorallocate($image,240, 71, 50);
  //name to write
  imagettftext($image,30,0,630,425,$red_color, $font_path, $name );

  // Turn off alpha blending and set alpha flag
  imagealphablending($image, false);
  imagesavealpha($image, true);

  header("Content-type:image/jpeg");
  imagejpeg($image);
  imagedestroy($image);

I have googled my problem and got to know it is having some bug
bugs.php.net
Is there any way to solve this problem?
