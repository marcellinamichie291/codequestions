# Animation makes the children's views disproportionate

I have a custom view that I want to animate from round to rectangle like this

My problem is that my child view is now disproportionate when I animate the scale.
My workaround has been to rescale also all child content to keep proportions but this seems a bit wrong.
Is there any ways to ask android to recalcul all views with their proportions according to the parent height and width ??
Here's my code :
    circleView!!.animateShape()
        currentAnimator = AnimatorSet().apply {
            play(
                ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(
                    circleView,
                    View.X,
                    startBounds.left,
                    finalBounds.left
                )
            ).apply {
                with(ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(circleView, View.SCALE_X, 1f, scaleX))
                with(ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(circleView, View.SCALE_Y, 1f, scaleY))
                // ðŸ‘‡ This is what I use to force the video background having good proportions... Maybe there is a better solution
                with(ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(cropedVideoView, View.SCALE_X, 1f, 1/finalRatio)) 
            }
            duration = shortAnimationDuration.toLong()
            interpolator = DecelerateInterpolator()
            addListener(object : AnimatorListenerAdapter() {

                override fun onAnimationEnd(animation: Animator) {
                    currentAnimator = null
                    state = State.expanded
                }

                override fun onAnimationCancel(animation: Animator) {
                    currentAnimator = null
                }
            })
            start()
        }

circleView : extends framelayout and just force content to be cropped in a circle or a rectangle. (I'm just changing the radius of a rectangle actually).
CropVideoTextureView: is a texture to crop the video according to the parent size.
