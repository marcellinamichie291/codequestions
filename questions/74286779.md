# I want to create a figure with three bar charts on it

I am trying to create a plot by grouping the data into categories: "Topic", "Person" and "Organisation" similar to this graph:

How can I do this?
Thank you very much.
This was my coding:

figure, axis = plt.subplots(2, 2)

df_per = df_per.sort_values(by=['Frequency'])
y1 = plt.barh(y=df_per.Person, width=df_per.Frequency);
plt.title('Person')

df_org = df_org.sort_values(by=['Frequency'])
y2 = plt.barh(y=df_org.Organization, width=df_org.Frequency);
plt.title('Organization')

df_top = df_loc.sort_values(by=['Frequency'])
y3 = plt.barh(y=df_top.Topic, width=df_top.Frequency);
plt.title('Topic')

plt.show()
