# Google Gen2 cloud function throws 413 Request Entity Too Large error

I'm trying to upload a file to GCS using cloud function. Api gateway is used to invoke it (POST).
The file size may vary but they are less than 32MB.
When I try to upload a file with size 10MB or above (less than 32MB), it is giving an error as 413 Request Entity Too Large: The data value transmitted exceeds the capacity limit.
Based on this article, max HTTP Request size is 32MB for Gen2 functions.
But it still fails to read the uploaded file.
Below is the sample code,
import functions_framework

@functions_framework.http
def main(request):
    """HTTP Cloud Function.
    Args:
    request (flask.Request): The request object.
    <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#incoming-request-data>
    Returns:
    The response text, or any set of values that can be turned into a
    Response object using `make_response`
    <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.make_response>.
    """

    try:
        request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
        request_args = request.args
        
        print(request.files.get('file').content_type)
        print(request.headers['Fullfilepath'])

        if request_json and 'name' in request_json:
            name = request_json['name']
        elif request_args and 'name' in request_args:
            name = request_args['name']
        else:
            name = 'World'
        return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        return "Something went wrong", 500


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Note: If a file size is below 10MB, this works
Could someone explain why its not working with Gen2 cloud function?
EDIT:
I use postman make api call.
Below is the cURL snippet from postman for the request,
curl --location --request POST 'https://<gen2-function-url>' \
--header 'Fullfilepath: myFile.xlsx' \
--form 'file=@"/C:/Users/jithin/Downloads/myFile.xlsx"'
