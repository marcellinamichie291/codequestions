# Converting a single and two digit string into a LocalDate Format

I have an application where the users have been able to select a pre-defined set of months from 1 to 12, which is then passed into a string.
Now I would like to convert that string into LocalDate, but I don't want my users to lose the data that has already been saved in the database. Is there some way to convert single or double digit data into LocalDate?
Eg. if the user has previously entered "2", then that data needs to be changed to 2022-02-01. If the user has previously entered "10" then this will be changed to 2022-10-01 and so on.
I am familiar with the formatting itself
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

public class LocalDateExample1_ISO_LOCAL_DATE {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE;
        String date = "2019-10-12";
        LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.parse(date, formatter);

        System.out.println(date);
        System.out.println(localDate);
        System.out.println(formatter.format(localDate));
    }
}
