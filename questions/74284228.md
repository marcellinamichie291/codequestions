# How to reduce lag in Turtlebot3 Camera

I am using turtlebot3 waffle_pi with default camera and raspberry pi4 4GB.
Have an issue with lag,
why does this camera cant operate smoothly with higher fps?
this camera uses 640 * 480 resolution (default setting in turtlebot3_bringup)
I am using this code to stream my camera
this code runs on

ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic


import rospy
import cv2


from sensor_msgs.msg import Image, CompressedImage
from cv_bridge import CvBridge

bridge = CvBridge()

def image_cb(data):
    cv_image = bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(data, "bgr8")
    cv2.imshow('raw image', cv_image)
    cv2.waitKey(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rospy.init_node('turtlebot3_rl_camera')
    rospy.Subscriber("/camera/image", Image, image_cb)
    rospy.spin()```
