# jpw tp iteratively read subset of data from athena using AWS EMR pyspark

using pyspark 2.4.7 on EMR5.33.1
I want to retrieve data from athena table by chunks. I thought about reading straight from S3 which is source of athena table and read each parquet file. Or add index to athena table then throw multiple queries.
What is most efficient way or best practice to get this done? I prefer reading straight from S3 however I cannot find any reference.
