# Program that computes the nth element of a number series given by a formula


Write a method/function with name cpSeries that computes the nth element in a series of numbers,  given by the formula: a(n) = (a(n-1))2+a(n-2) when: n>1 and assuming that: a(1)=1, a(0)=0 Note that indexing of the series starts from 0.

I have already written the above code but it runs for an infinite time and I don't know how to fix it in order to compute the nth element.
Any ideas? I have to use only functions to solve this problem.
# include <stdio.h>

int cpSeries(int n)
{    
    int Nthterm = 0;
    int i;
    
    if (n==0) {
        cpSeries(0) == 0;
    }
    else if (n==1) {
        cpSeries(1) == 1;
    }
    for (i=0; i<=n; i++){
        Nthterm = cpSeries((n-1))*cpSeries((n-1)) + cpSeries((n-2));
        return Nthterm;
    }
}

int main()
{
    int n=6;
    printf("The Nth term of the series is: %d",cpSeries(n));
}
