# Navigating from children screen to parent's sibling screen in React Navigation

I have few questions about React Navigation. I want to navigate from child screen to parent's sibling component, but I couldn't find a proper way for that. My navigation in the app looks like this:
Stack (Main)

LoginPage
Desk (DrawerNavigation)

Messages


MyAccount

Here I want to navigate to MyAccount, from Messages (Desk's child screen). How can I achieve that?
