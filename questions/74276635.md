c++ core guidelines under "Example, better still" shows a string member being initialized by a string_view.
A couple cppcon talks discourages people from doing that 
CppCon 2018: Victor Ciura “Enough string_view to Hang Ourselves” 
CppCon 2017: Nicolai Josuttis “C++ Templates Revised” 
I have also read similar things in a couple blog posts. Am I misunderstanding something here? Is it considered good practice to construct a string member using a string_view or not?
