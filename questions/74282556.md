# Error Code: 3819. Check constraint 'Car_yr2' is violated

My question says that it wants me to add a constraint so that the company cannot purchase any more car that were made before 2018.The problem is that my database already has info about cars that were made before 2018. I cant delete the table because it will mess with some of my other queries . Can i get some advice on it?
My code below.
-- Company has decided not to purchase any more car that were made before 2018. Add appropriate constraints to the Vehicle table to enforce this requirement.

alter table Vehicle add constraint checker_1 check (CarYear > 2018);
