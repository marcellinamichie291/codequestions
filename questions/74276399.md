# Cypress Assertions contradictions?

So i think this is one area that I run into issues with, and despite Cypress's amazing documentation assertions sort of feel lacking (but maybe thats because they use Chai assertions and I should be looking there? but even then i've run into confusion).
Anyways, it seems like when I am asserting on some items within cypress I return into conflicting results and I can't seem to pinpoint any reason why.
A few examples specifically:
Why does should(‘contain’,'{Some Text}) search child elements but should(‘have.text/value’,{Some Text}) does not? Or at least thats how it appears? I can't find any documentation that states this
In the example above I noticed this when having a cy.get on an angular dropdown toggle with a <span> within it (that contains the text).
Another oddity is have.text vs have.value. I've noticed sometimes works when the other doesn't. For example input fields only have.value works but not contains or have.text. Is there any reason for this?
I guess im trying to figure out if there is some cheat sheet/guide to when to use each one because it's mostly been trial and error for me (But i'd like to know "why" one works and the other doesn't).
Thanks!
