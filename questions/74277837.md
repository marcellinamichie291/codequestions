# Why Passport.js is correctly redirecting after a successful login?

Im trying to implement a Local Strategy using NodeJs/Express/Passport.js. I already have a google oauth that is working perflecty. But the Local strategy does not work, I can see that the user is found but it won't ever redirect to the success url.
This is my auth route the goole one is the exact same thing but it work.
router.post("/login", passport.authenticate('local', {
    successRedirect: successLoginUrl,
    failureRedirect: errorLoginUrl,
    failureMessage: true
}));

My passport.ts
passport.use(new LocalStrategy({ passReqToCallback: true },
    async (req: any, username: string, password: string, done: done) => {
        try {
            //We find the user corresponding to the username
            const user = await User.findOne(username) as Array<User>;
          
            if (user.length == 0) {
                //User does not exist...
                return done(null, false, { message: "Email or Password is not correct" });
            }

            //We check if the password is OK
            const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user[0].password);
            
            if (match) {
                req.user = user[0];
                return done(null, user[0])
            } else {
                return done(null, false, { message: "Email or Password is not correct" })
            }

        } catch (error) {
            console.log("ERR", error);
            return done(error);
        }
    })
);


My user serialization/deserialize
passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
    done(null, (user as User).id)
})

passport.deserializeUser(async (id, done) => {
    const user = await User.findOne(id as number).catch((err: Error) => {
        done(err, null);
    })

    if (user) done(null, user as Iusers);
})

Iv'e noticed that deserializeUser is never called but serialize yes.
Thanks to anyone !
