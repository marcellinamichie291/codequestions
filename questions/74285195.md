# Associative function for building a chain

I have the following question.
Why doesn't blockchain use some commutative and associative operation on hashes instead of a hash?
For example
Let Hn = hash(Bn, Sn) - hash after adding block n, 
Bn - block n
Sn - some unique information about block n

Then
Hn+1  = F(Hn, Hn-1, ..., H0)
At that:
1) F(Hi, Hj) = F(Hj, Hi)
2) F(Hi, F(Hj, Hk)) = F(F(Hi, Hj), Hk)

In this case, in order to check whether a certain block belongs to the chain, it will not be necessary to transfer the entire chain.
