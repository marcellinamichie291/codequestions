# How to save file in two different directories after uploading a file in Django

I am working in Python Django with version 4.0.4. I have stucked in a situation where I want to save a file in two different directories at the same time when user browse the file and click on upload button. I am already saving the file in one directory, now I want to save the same file in two different directories. Kindly help me to resolve this issue:
Here is the code:
views.py:
def upload(request):
if request.method=="POST":
uploaded_file = request.FILES['file extension']
fs = FileSystemStorage()
fs.save(uploaded_file.name, uploaded_file)
print(upload_file.name)
print(upload_file.size)
return render(request, 'abc.html')

abc.html:
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
{% csrf_token %}
<input type="file" name="xyz">
<button type="submit"> upload file </button>
</form>

urls.py:
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

if setting.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

settins.py:
MEDIA_ROOT= '/home/abc/directory1/foldername1'
MEDIA_URL = 'abc/'

#MEDIA_ROOT_1= '/home/abc/directory2/foldername2'
#MEDIA_URL_1 = 'abc2/'

Here are the methods for which I am saving the file in a single directory, but when I apply the same methods with different objects It doesn't bother the MEDIA_ROOT_1 and doesn't save the file in this directory. It always save the file of the given path in MEDIA_ROOT. Kindly help me to save this file in different directories
