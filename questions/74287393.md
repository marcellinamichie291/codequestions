# How Can i create Custom logic before login with Social login with CakeDC/User plugin?

The problem is in my users table, we already have email of user existing in our DB, so we try to apply one more layer which include google SSO which allow user to log in if and only if that user have the same email in our DB. But it turn out every user can login event if they don't have one.
If user doesn't have the same email in DB, redirect back to login page.
