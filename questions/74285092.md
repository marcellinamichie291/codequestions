# laravel existing application Laravel.yml to codepipeline

I have a laravel application in local development added to codecommit. I have added AWS Beanstalk to run this application to run,
everything works perfectly fine,
but to connect with the database and other dependencies I don't know how to add the laravel.yml to the directory,
Please help me find this. Any documentation or tutorial on this?
thanks in advance,
