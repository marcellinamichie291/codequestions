# Please configure the inventory detail for item

I am trying to create an item fulfillment for an item , the on hand quantity on item fulfillment record is showing as X for that item at that location , but when it says configure inventory details for line X i am not able to see available under the status column
I tried creating a saved search and getting the item's on hand greater than zero and location in the results but got as empty
I also checked previous item fulfillments for that item they are created successfully with on hand quantity but now i am getting error as - Please configure the inventory detail for item
