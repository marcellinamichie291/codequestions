# Add Bibliography / reference list to word document using docx npm

I am using npm docx pacakge (https://www.npmjs.com/package/docx) to export documents as docx documents in my react app. I havenÂ´t found a way to add a bibliography / reference list from code in the api docs / usage guidelines. Is there a way to add a bibliography and connect paragraphs from code or doesnt the package support this?
