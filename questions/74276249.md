#len(x) -> 1 

Actually my question is simple, but i couldn't solve this problem... What should i use to solve it, i mean should i use recrusive functions or for loop ???
for i in range(len(x)):
    for j in range(len(x)):
        for k in range(len(x)):
            for _ in range(len(x)):
                for ...
