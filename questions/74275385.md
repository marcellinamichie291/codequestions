# HTML - Icon and text don't align on smaller screens

I have a contact info div with an email and a phone number displayed as an icon followed by the email and number:

However, when I go below a certain threashold the email text seems to jump a little bit below the icon:

The content is put on a "card" which is placed on the website, here is the general code:


    .content-card{
        max-width: 100vw;
        padding: 0 2em 0;
    }
    .contact-options-wrapper{
        padding: 1em 0em; 
    }
    .fs-contact-info{
        font-size: clamp(1vw, 4vw, 1.5em);
    }
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.0/css/all.min.css">    
<div class="content-card">        
    <div class="fs-contact-info contact-options-wrapper">
        <div><a href="mailto:myemail_12345@gmail.com"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myemail_12345@gmail.com</a></div>
        <div><a href="tel:+46123456789"><i class="fa-solid fa-phone"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+46 12 345 67 89</a></div>
    </div>              
</div>



I removed some of the background color and similar styling that don't affect the question.
How can I get the text next to the icon to always be in line and not jump down like that?
Ps. In my example you might need to run the snippet, go into full mode, then inspect and make it really narrow. On my real website the effect comes into play at around 500px, which makes this "wrong" on basically all mobiles.
