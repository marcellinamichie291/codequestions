# MQTT on a standalone device with docker

I'm trying to set up a basic standalone smartspeaker, here some details, with Homeassistant, Rhasspy and Mosquitto.
Unfortunately, standalone means no internet connection and no IP network.
How can I use Mosquitto with no internet connection ?
I have a fixed IP for the Raspberry. I tried, with no success:

to setup a "lease" option in dhclient.conf (no success), my aim was to trick Mosquitto (it "sees" a fixed IP even with no IP network)
to configure fallback option (Fail to establish a IP network, then get an IP adress)

-> Do you have any idea to configure my Rpi in order to get Mosquitto working with no IP network?
The config is in docker, any advice to change it ?:
