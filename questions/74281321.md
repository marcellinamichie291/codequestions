# Find the average number of orders placed per month for each category of an item sold

trying to work the below on big query. can anyone tell me where i am going wrong.
also the date is in timestamp
SELECT  (COUNT(Items_purchased])) / (SELECT COUNT(Order_id) FROM table where Order_id IS NOT NULL) OVER (ORDER BY Order_date)
FROM table
GROUP BY Items_purchased, Order_date

tried using the avg function itself, but bq has been throwing errors even when checking for avg no of orders paced per item.
