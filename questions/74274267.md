# Not able to convert this terraform code to bicep

This block of code is in terraform. I would like it to be in BICEP.
Th following code block enables HealthCheck.
Health Check gets automatically enabled if you set the path for health check under site_config block. But there is no parameter to configure the load balancing time from terraform.
I tested it by adding the site_config block with health_check_path:
resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name                       = "terraform-azure-functions"
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  app_service_plan_id        = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id
  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key
  site_config{
  health_check_path          = "/api/health" # need to configure for enabling Health check
  }
}

I tried reading the BICEP documentation, however my attempts would get an error in testing and not work
