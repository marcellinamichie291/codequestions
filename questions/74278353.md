# Use Declared variable across razor pages

I hope somebody can helping with the following. Spend a lot of time on the internet to research but i can't find the correct answer.
I'm using ASP.NET Razor syntax (.razor components) with embeded C# code.
I have 2 razor files BindingData.razor and GetBindingData.razor.
I want pass the string variable 'BindingData' from the Bindingdata.razor page to the other razor page GetbindingData.razor.
<!-- BindingData.razor -->
@page "/bindingdata"
@inherits LayoutComponentBase

<PageTitle>Web App Testing</PageTitle>

<div class="page">
    <div class="sidebar">
        <NavMenu />
    </div>

    <main>
        <div class="top-row px-4">
           
                <select class="btn-primary" @bind="BindingData">
                    <option value="D1">Data 1#</option>
                    <option value="D2">Data 2#</option>
                </select>

        </div>
        <article class="content px-4">
            @Body
        </article>
    </main>
</div>

@code {

    string BindingData;
    
}

Problem: Now i'm using an other razor components GetBindingData.razor but when running the web app the variable BindingData is empty when loading the GetBindingData.razor page.
<!-- GetBindingData.razor -->
@page "/Getbindingdata"
<PageTitle>GetSelectedBindingData</PageTitle>

<div><!- showing selected data from BindingData.razor --> 
@BindingData;

</div>`

My question is what's the best way to pass value from one razor components to other razor components?
I have read of using namespace/classes but i new to this way of programming. Does somebody has and example of it how to store value..
Maybe there is also a simply way to make the data value available globaly arcros the program.
I hope somebody can helping.
thanks,
Research on the internet but i can not find the answer.
