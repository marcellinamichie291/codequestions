# 'opencv2/opencv.hpp' file not found （and lib has no matching file） macos

I use macos, I downloaded opencv according to the following url, but I got this error when trying to use it in xcode or vscode. https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html
i use path in xcode like:
1.Framework Search Path: /urs/local/lib
2.Header Search Path: /urs/local/include
3.Library Search Paths :/Users/myname/ide/build_opencv/lib
I installed it completely according to the steps in the tutorial.
I created a new project and add file from lib to my project, but no matter what I write in include, it shows that it cannot be found
