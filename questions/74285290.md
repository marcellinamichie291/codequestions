# Swagger and Melody are not working together in my project

I have implemented Swagger and Melody at the same time on my maven Spring Boot Project, but it seems to have a problem that both of them are not running simultaneously, i will have to stop one of the service to use other every time,when i need to use melody i will have to comment code for swagger and viceversa.
