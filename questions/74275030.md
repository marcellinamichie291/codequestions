# Getting back the array using recursion

Using Python , I'm trying to get back every item in the array using recursion but getting weird results
The original array is [1,2,3] and I'm getting back [1, [2, [3]]]
What am I doing wrong in my code?
This is the code I wrote:
def arr_to_arr(arr):
    arr1=[]
    if len(arr)==1:
        arr1.append(arr[0])
        print(arr1)
    else:
        arr1.append(arr[0])
        arr1.append(arr_to_arr(arr[1:]))
        print(arr1)
    return arr1

arr_to_arr([1,2,3])
