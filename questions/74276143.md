# Harbor Replication Master-Master?

I am deciding between two configurations for Harbor Replication. Either Master-copy/copies or Master-Master/s seems to be possible as per this article (https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/3582). The Harbor registries are in two different geographies. I am leaning towards Master-Master but would like to hear if there are any known issues with bi-directional replication.
