# Better way to design Attendance Managment Design

Good evenings. I trying to make simple Attendance Managment Sytem using MySQL. My goal is teacher can mark student attendance in given day and student can see his/her attendance. But i am having problem about design. First, let me explian my system.
Here is my plannig....

System has Student,Teacher and Courses.
A Teacher can teach multiple Course.
A Course can have multiple Teacher.
A Course dividen in Groups, for example 1 Course have group 1 and group 2 in different times.
A Teacher can teach Course in Multiple Groups but a Group can have only one teacher.
Student can have only one group in just one Course.
A Group can have multiple students.
A Group can occur in different time for example Group 1 has lecture in monday and tuesday.
Teacher can mark student attendance in his Course and Group


I have confusion in this system.First,i could not figure out where i should connect attendance table, because i wanted to student can see his attendance day by day so i connected to group_dates and as you can see attendance table have many attributes so it will be affect performance. Second one is should i connect student to course_groups alone or should i connect it both course_groups and courses like in the example?
I am very new to MySQL and design, if you can give advice i will be very appriciated
