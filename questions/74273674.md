I want to know how to identify webrtc decoding type of safari browser？For example, H264, H265 etc...
Chrome has a webrtc tool "chrome://webrtc-internals/", while it didn't work in Safari. I also add debug menu to Safari, while I still can't run the webrtc log. Is there any solution to know the webrtc decoder of Safari browser on Mac and ios?
