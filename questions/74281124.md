# How do I run a bash command (in this instance, python running a script) when a specific file changes its name in linux?

I have this .AppImage that, when it updates itself, changes its name to match its version. I also have a python script to update a .desktop shortcut with the new file name. Is there any way to detect the AppImages' name change, then run the python script?
I've tried to find a bash command that detects a file's name change, but have only come up with results on how to change a file's name.
