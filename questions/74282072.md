# tkinter installed correctly on the pc, but PyCharm tells me: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'

I have successfully installed tkinter on the pc. If I open a certain project using Idle Python, Visual Studio Code or other editors, then the project opens correctly without errors. Using PyCharm 2022.2.3 (Community Edition). Using Python 3.10.6 on Linux.
If i try to open the same project with PyCharm, I get the error:
     from tkinter import ttk
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'

Process finished with exit code 1

How can I solve?
I repeat, with the same project, I get the error only from PyCharm, while from other editors no errors
