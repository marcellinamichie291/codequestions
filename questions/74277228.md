# io_uring in multithreaded process

I am trying to write a multithreaded server using io_uring.
The problem is the function 'io_uring_wait_cqe' requires calling to io_uring_cqe_seen to mark the CQE as seen.
Therefore, in several threads, there may be a situation where the same event is handled in several threads.
Of course, I don't want to use locks, mutex, etc.
What is the best way to work with several threads?
