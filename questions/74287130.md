# Python creates new names in the function space?

In [14]: x_0.i
Out[14]: 5

In [15]: def fx(x_0):
    ...:     x_0 = None
    ...:

In [16]: x_0.i
Out[16]: 5

I'm curious so in this, the function argument is actually a different name than the previous namespace. Only that name was directed to None.
How do you explain this?
