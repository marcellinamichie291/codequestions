# UWP GetThumbnailAsync gives different result depending on files selection system

I'm experiencing an issue in using GetThumbnailAsync() method of a StorageFile. When file is selected with the file picker the thumbnail is correctly generated; when searching files by using GetFilesAsync(), generic image icon is retrieved.
Code for retrieving files is the following:
`
var queryOptions = new QueryOptions(CommonFileQuery.OrderByDate, fileTypeFilter);
queryOptions.FolderDepth = FolderDepth.Deep;

var cacheFolder = KnownFolders.PicturesLibrary;
var result = cacheFolder.CreateFileQueryWithOptions(queryOptions);
var files = await result.GetFilesAsync();

`
Thumbnail is generated by using:
var thumbnail = await imageFile.GetThumbnailAsync(ThumbnailMode.SingleItem, (uint)requestedSize, ThumbnailOptions.UseCurrentScale);
I really don't understand why this difference in result.
NB Of course, I selected PictureLibrary in app manifest file.
Any help?
