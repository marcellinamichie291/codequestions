# Varchar variable is not working in WHERE clause

Why does this work...
DECLARE @MyInt int = 12345;
SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyId = @MyInt; --Returns 1 row
SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyId = 12345;  --Returns 1 row

but this doesn't?
DECLARE @MyVarchar varchar = 'ABCDEF';
SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyId = @MyVarchar; --Returns 0 rows
SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyId = 'ABCDEF';   --Returns 1 row
