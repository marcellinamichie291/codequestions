# flutter_test: hide keyboard after entering text?

I am writing integration tests using flutter_test and cannot find any documentation or examples as to how to handle the keyboard after typing. Ideally I would like the test to close the keyboard and then proceed with clicking elements that would otherwise be obscured by it.
How does one exit/minimize the keyboard in flutter_test?
