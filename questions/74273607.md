# How to access inter interface which not export in typescript?

I have the FileConfig interface, which includes the FileProps interface.
Those interfaces are in type.ts file, and they are outside my project (in node_modules):
interface FileProps {
  type?: string;
  label?: string;
}

export interface FileConfig<
  Props = FileProps & {
    [additionalProperties: string]: any;
  }
> {
  name?: string;
  props?: Props;
}

I want to create foo function that takes two arguments, one is for FileProps and the second for FileConfig.
The problem is FileProps is not export so I can't able to import from this file.
Is possible with typescript to access FileProps from ConfigProps?
import { FileConfig } from './type';

function foo(props: FileProps, config: FileConfig) {}

Something like this? (FileConfig.FileProps)√è
import { FileConfig } from './type';

function foo(props: FileConfig.FileProps, config: FileConfig) {}
