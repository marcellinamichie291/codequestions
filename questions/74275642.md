# psycopg2 error syntax error at or near None value

i have created this list and i am trying to retrieve some data from SQL with the following formula:
 list_upi= upi.tolist()
 json_string=json.dumps(list_upi)
 crr = sstn.query_db('aurora', f"""select "Carbon" from api.match_sec_str_array('{list_upi}')""")
 execute()

The list looks like this:
 0        1035711463.0
 1        1007978477.0
 2        1250122485.0
 3        1008200741.0
 4        2000828698.0

But for some reason some data can't be fined and i got this error
 syntax error at or near "None"
 LINE 1: ...879.0, 1008759844.0, 1008144844.0, 1008156925.0, 'None', 100...
        

Is there a way i can change the none values to null or anything like that so the code doesn't stop when data will not be found. Thanks in advance!
PS: i have tried this with data that exists in the database, and it does work, it's only this time when it doesn't.
