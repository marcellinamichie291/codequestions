# How can I verify that the downloaded file has Python csv content

I will always need to download some files through python and check if the content is csv or not
How could I do this normally?
Parse the content?
That would take quite a bit I guess
    def download(self):
        temp_file_name = 'test.csv'
        response = self.requests.get(self.feed_location)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise RequestFeedException('File not found or not request permission')

        with open(temp_file_name, 'w') as temp_file:
            temp_file.writelines(response.content)

        return temp_file_name

My code so far
