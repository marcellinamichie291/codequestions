# IONIC React input label alignment issue

I am using Ionic React
but there seems to be issues with the alignment of labels and inputs
they do not center within the input. the alignment is completely off
(I have added border around to show, but there is no other css custom)
I have tried a new project and looking on online examples and this seems to be the case in all of them
The code is just the raw code
    <IonItem>
      <IonLabel position="stacked">Username</IonLabel>
      <IonInput></IonInput>
    </IonItem>

    <IonItem lines='none'>
      <IonLabel position="floating">Email</IonLabel>
      <IonInput
        value={email}
        onIonChange={onEmailChange}
      ></IonInput>
    </IonItem>


ion-input {
  background: rgba(250,250,250,1);
  border: solid 1px rgba(218,218,218,1);
  border-radius: 6px;
}

please help
