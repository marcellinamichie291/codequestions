# How do I can fix the error Use no-check-certificate

I'm trying to get access to the dataset using:
!wget https://liquidtelecom.dl.sourceforge.net/project/easc-corpus/EASC/EASC.zip

But I got the following error message
ERROR: cannot verify liquidtelecom.dl.sourceforge.net's certificate, issued by ‘CN=R3,O=Let's Encrypt,C=US’:
  Issued certificate has expired.
To connect to liquidtelecom.dl.sourceforge.net insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.

Can you please suggest a solution?
