So I want to make a funtunality like in Windows when you display a Picture that when you zoom in you can just move the Picture with the mouse. I already got the zoom part in my project:
<ScrollViewer Name="scroll" Margin="40"
                  HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Auto" 
                  VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto">
                <Canvas
                MouseWheel="Container_MouseWheel" x:Name="canvas">
                    <Viewbox>
                        <Image x:Name="img"  Source="{Binding imageSource}" Grid.ColumnSpan="2" />

                    </Viewbox>
                </Canvas>
            </ScrollViewer>

and the Code in the MouseWheel Event:
  var element = sender as UIElement;
        var position = e.GetPosition(element);
        var transform = element.RenderTransform as MatrixTransform;
        var matrix = transform.Matrix;
        var scale = e.Delta >= 0 ? 1.1 : (1.0 / 1.1); // choose appropriate scaling factor

        matrix.ScaleAtPrepend(scale, scale, position.X, position.Y);
        element.RenderTransform = new MatrixTransform(matrix);

but now Ive got the Problem that when I zoom I cant just click and hold the Image with the mouse and move to an another part of the picture, if you dont really know what I mean just open an Image on windows zoom in and then hold the mouse and move in the picture.
What I have tried was to add these 3 Events to my Canvas and this is the code behind for the 3 Events:
  private Image draggedImage;
    private Point mousePosition;
    private void Canvas_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
    {
        var image = e.Source as Image;

        if (image != null && canvas.CaptureMouse())
        {
            mousePosition = e.GetPosition(canvas);
            draggedImage = image;
            Panel.SetZIndex(draggedImage, 1); // in case of multiple images
        }
    }

    private void Canvas_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
    {
        if (draggedImage != null)
        {
            canvas.ReleaseMouseCapture();
            Panel.SetZIndex(draggedImage, 0);
            draggedImage = null;
        }
    }

    private void Canvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        if (draggedImage != null)
        {
            var position = e.GetPosition(canvas);
            var offset = position - mousePosition;
            mousePosition = position;
            Canvas.SetLeft(draggedImage, Canvas.GetLeft(draggedImage) + offset.X);
            Canvas.SetTop(draggedImage, Canvas.GetTop(draggedImage) + offset.Y);
        }
    }

but this didnt work saddly, does anyone has an Idea on how to make it work?
