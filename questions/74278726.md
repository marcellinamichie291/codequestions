# Trying to understand how recaptcha works step by step

This is my current understanding of recaptcha (using v2 invisible)

We load the api.js script onto our site
We add data attributes to the button
User clicks button
A listener somewhere in the api.js script fires because it's listening for an event on a tag with those data attributes
This is where it gets fuzzy and I start guessing:
api.js gathers browsing info from the user's cookies and information about how they interacted with the site. Based on this it determines how likely you are are to be a bot and if you are below a certain threshold it gives you a test. Whether you pass the test then gets further factored into your score and all of that gets encoded into a token, which we receive in our callback that we specified on the button's data attribute.
We pass this token to the back end with the rest of our form
From the backend, we make an API request to Google to convert the token into usable information about whether the user passed or failed.

At this point I get confused about why this wasn't just what the api.js script returned in the first place. Does this step only exist in order to give Recaptcha information to further improve it? I just don't understand why this step is here, unless I'm misunderstanding what is going on earlier in the process. Am I getting these we steps wrong? Thanks.
