This is a table in the database. It shows 70 countries around the world with player names and gender. It shows which player score how many goals in which year. The years goes from 1990 to 2015. So the table is large. Now I would like to know which female player and which male player score most in 2010 for every country.
I am expecting to have a output which show country, gender, player and score
SELECT country,gender,year, score where year="2010", group by 1,2,3
