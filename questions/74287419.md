# discord.py - Shard ID None session has been invalidated

I have a sharded bot with two scripts:
First looks like this:
bot = discord.Client(intents=discord.Intents.all())
...
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    channel.send(...)
bot.run(token)

And second:
bot = commands.AutoShardedBot(
    intents=discord.Intents.all(), shard_ids=[0], shard_count=1, command_prefix=""
)
...
bot.run(token)

After I start the bot with these two scripts, after 2 days of real time, the first script gives the following error

And because the on_ready event says to send a message, the message is sent again, and the previous sent message has to be deleted manually.
I searched for this error and don't understand what can raise this error and how to fix it.
I want the session to be always active and does not end with such an error. So that the session does not connect with another Gateway.
