# How to update all but one python packages?

I've multiple python packages installed on my system. My update script calls pip-review --local --auto to update all the python packages. However, I don't want to update all packages. What I want is pip-review to update all packages except scons, since one of my programs needs an older version of scons. Currently to do this, I run pip-review --local --auto && python3 pip uninstall -y scons && python3 -m pip install -Iv scons==3.1.2 which updates all packages and then uninstalls the new version of scons and then re-installs it with a specific version number. Is there a nicer way to do this?
