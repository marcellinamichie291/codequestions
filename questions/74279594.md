I just developed a text adventure like Zork in Java, but now I want to make this portable in android and in other desktops pc. At first I coded it for the Java Console, but then I realized I'd like to add a graphic editor for the Room Map and some GUI to the game ecc. So, I started to code the game editor in Java Swing. But Java Swing leaves me with the porting issue. I ended up with android studio and Libgdx, but I'm struggling to code a good Text Input box to get the text. I tried to search online some solution but I've found very few people who tried to code something like my project with Libgdx. So my question is: should I use the scene2d environment?
