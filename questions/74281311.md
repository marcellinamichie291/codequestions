# Trouble getting country and D.O.B. in Wikidata SPARQL

I'm trying to write a SPARQL query to get the country of birth/citizenship (whichever is available) and date of birth of musical artists/members of bands. I've got a query which works fairly well, however fails in some cases because of pages with something extra added on to their name for disambiguation, eg. "(singer)" or "(musician)".
Is there a more efficient and reliable way to solve this than what I've already tried?
This is my current solution, however it means that (on the second line) I have to manually write in all the possibilities (and I'm sure I'm missing some still). The query is constructed in JavaScript, so the fewer repetitions of the variable word (in this example "Queen"), the better.
SELECT ?page ?birth ?locLabel WHERE{
  {VALUES ?page {"Queen"@en "Queen (band)"@en "Queen (singer)"@en "Queen (rapper)"@en}.
  ?sitelink schema:name ?page;
            schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>;
            schema:about ?item.
  OPTIONAL{?item wdt:P27 ?loc. hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true.}
  OPTIONAL{?item wdt:P495 ?loc. hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true.}
  OPTIONAL{?item wdt:P569 ?birth. hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true.}
  OPTIONAL{?item wdt:P527 [wdt:P569 ?birth]. hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true.}}
  SERVICE wikibase:label{bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en".}
}
