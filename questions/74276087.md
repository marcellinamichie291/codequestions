# How to Encrypt a symmetric key?

I'm trying to encrypt a symmetric key file but i keep getting an error. The code below extracts the public key from the certificate and then encrypts it. I keep getting the error ValueError: No PEM start marker "b'-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----'" found.
with open("bob.crt") as f:
    bob_crt = f.read()

public_key = RSA.import_key(bob_crt)
if isinstance(public_key, RSA.RsaKey):
    print(public_key.export_key())
else:
    print("Other key")

with open ("public.pem", "w") as pub_file:
    print("{}".format(public_key.exportKey()), file=pub_file)


# read the symmetric key for encrypting purpose
skey=open('symmetric.key','rb')
key=skey.read()

# create the cipher
cipher=Fernet(key)

# open the public key file
pkey=open('public.pem','rb')
pkdata=pkey.read()

# load the file
pubkey=rsa.PublicKey.load_pkcs1(pkdata)

# encrypt the symmetric key with public key
encrypted_key=rsa.encrypt(key,pubkey)

# write the encrypted symmetric key to a file
ekey= open('encrypted_symm_key.txt','wb')
ekey.write(encrypted_key)


I'm unsure why i have the issue. I'm using python. Any help would be great.
Thanks
