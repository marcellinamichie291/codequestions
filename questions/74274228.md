# my application takes pics and videos that I want stored in there own folder like what's app but outside of the /DCIM/Camera, how can I do that?

I have tried to create an application that has or creates its own folder when I take a picture or video just in the root folder where files that come with the android phone are located...im no sure how to go about this, please help. all my pictures and my videos are within a recycler view and I can view all there thumbnails but I want to be able to have my own folder outside DCIM so I can have full control over read and write functions
