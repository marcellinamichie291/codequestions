# How to get TypeScript to ignore a certain protocol on import specifiers and resolve modules as if it did not exist?

A Rollup plugin that I have uses protocol prefixes upon module specifiers in order to signal different behaviors that are necessary for the module. An example of this would be import ... from 'island:./my-island.js'. TS, however, is a bit of an issue.
I cannot figure out how to get TS to ignore the island: prefix and resolve the module and its types normally (./my-island.js). It is not viable to enforce these modules follow a certain pattern or API, so, as far as I know, I cannot provide a typing for island: directly.
Thanks,
