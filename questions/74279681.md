# I'm having difficulty finding this web element with Selenium webdriver

I am using selenium webdriver to pull data from one website and my goal is to copy and paste that date into another site using python, I am able to pull the data from the 1st site using iFrame + XPATH but on the 2nd site I am failing to locate the exact web element. I pasted it below:
<textarea rows="5" aria-invalid="false" placeholder="Paste in a list of emails separated by commas or new lines" class="MuiOutlinedInput-input MuiInputBase-input MuiInputBase-inputMultiline MuiInputBase-inputSizeSmall TextInput-input css-x7mp9n" id="mui-2" style="height: 115px;"></textarea>
