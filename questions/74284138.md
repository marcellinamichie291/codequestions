# How does the standard library conform to the text stream model?

My question is regarding the following paragraph on page 15 (Section 1.5) of The ANSI C Programming Language (2e) by Kernighan and Ritchie (emphasis added):

The model of input and output supported by the standard library is very simple.
Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to,
is dealt as a stream of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided
into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.
It is the responsibility of the library to make each input or output stream conform to
this model; the C programmer using the library need not worry about how lines are
represented outside the program.

I'm unsure of what is meant by the text in bold, especially the line "it is the responsibility of the library to make each input or ouptput stream conform to this model." Could someone please help me understand what this means?
At first, I thought it had something to do with the line-buffering of stdin I was seeing when I call getchar() when stdin is empty, but then learned that the buffering mode varies across implementations (see here). So I don't think this is what the text in bold is referring to when it talks about conforming to the text stream model.
