I'm trying to read 3 lines from the text file using getline() function in C++, it was working fine when I'd 2 lines as I was able to differentiate by calculating if it's odd or even line but with 3 lines it's not possible that way...so if there's any way to do using getline() function
This is how the data in the text file looks:

I want to read in a way that each set of 3 lines represents a separate node in the code... so 1st line of a node is name of the contact, 2nd line of a node is the contact group and 3rd line is phone number in that way, I've data for multiple nodes stored in series
void reopenCB() {
    bool isEmpty;
    ifstream myfile("contactbook.txt");
    if (myfile.is_open() & myfile.peek() != EOF) {
        int i = 0;
        while (getline(myfile, x)) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                if (head == NULL) {
                    Node *newer = new Node;
                    newer->name = x;

                    newer->next = NULL;
                    newer->prev == NULL;
                    head = newer;
                } else {
                    Node *newer = new Node;

                    newer->name = x;
                    newer->next = NULL;

                    Node *temp = head;
                    while (temp->next != NULL) {
                        temp = temp->next;
                    }
                    temp->next = newer;
                    newer->prev = temp;
                }
            } else if (i % 2 != 0) {
                Node *temp = head;
                if (temp->phone_number == 0) {
                    stringstream convert(x);
                    convert >> z;
                    temp->phone_number = z;
                } else {
                    Node *temp = head;
                    while (temp->next != NULL) {
                        temp = temp->next;
                    }

                    stringstream convert(x);
                    convert >> z;
                    temp->phone_number = z;

                }

            }
        }
        myfile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "  File is Empty so Cannot open...Sorry" << endl;
    }
}

this was working fine when I'd 2 lines...but now as I've 3...it's not reading correct values
