# Cannot get GLTF model with Vercel

I've deployed a website built with React, Vite and ThreeJS on Vercel.
In the ./src/models folder there's a scene.gltf file that is displayed on the homepage.
const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader, './src/models/scene.gltf');

In localhost the website works fine, but when I open the website on Vercel, this error appears:
Uncaught Error: Could not load ./src/models/scene.gltf: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data)
