# Doing a screen capture in Chrome of all DIVs under element using getDisplayMedia

Is there a way to take a screenshot of a HTML element and all its children using:  getDisplayMedia and save it / download it as a single png image?
I do not want to stream content, I just have a very complex SVG / Canvas / HTML setup and need to take a screenshot of the entire root DIV.
Tried many of the techniques for image snapshot in Chrome but non of them did the trick in capturing everything, so I am thinking maybe MediaRecorder > png will work?
thanks you
