# Getting logs with the OpenShift Java REST Client

I'm using the OpenShift Java REST Client (https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-java) and I do not know how to get logs (pod/container): oc logs
Or how to execute this command:
oc exec -it egressgateway -c istio-proxy -- cat var/log/dnf.rpm.log
Or:
oc exec -it pod_name -c istio-proxy -- curl localhost:15000/config_dump
I will be glad of any help!
I tried to do something like this, but I don't know what to do next
IClient client = new ClientBuilder("url")
      .withUserName("name")
      .withPassword("password")
      .build();

client.get("pod", "egressgateway", "project_cp");
((Pod) out).getContainers()
