# Working with conditional If-Else in Dask Dataframe

I am working on converting a pandas dataframe to a dask dataframe but am confused on how to switch certain functions to work with dask. I have a if else statement that checks for Nans and outputs cell data in that cell if Nan does not exist as so
df['new_col'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['ND3'] if row['V3'] == row['V3']\
       else (row['ND2'] if row['V2'] == row['V2'] else \
           (row['TS'] if row['Vs'] == row['Vs'] else '')), axis=1)

I have tried converting/vectorizing the statement with numpy.where and then using dask.array.where as so
df['NewCol'] = da.where((df['V3'] == df['V3']), df['ND3'],  #when then
                   da.where((df['V2']== df['V2']), df['ND2'],   #when then
                      da.where((df['Vs'] == df['Vs']), df['TS'], #when then
                          ???)))  #else


except I am running into errors.. any help?
