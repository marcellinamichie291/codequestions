# java.nio.Path: How do I force java to resolve `..` when Path is relative to the current directory?

Suppose I have the following directory structure:
| baz/
|-- | foo/
|   |-- bar.txt

And that I run my program so that the current directory is baz/. If I define a Path like this:
var foo = Path.of("../foo/bar.txt");

I want to present this path to the user, but when I just print the path out as is it includes the .., like this:
../foo/bar.txt

How do I get it to present this path like this instead?
baz/foo/bar.txt
