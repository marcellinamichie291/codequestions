# STM32 flash force write broke MCU

I have MCU STM32F415xx and was trying to write on internal flash. But for reason I don't know PGPERR and PSGERR flags were turning on in random time (as I found, problem can be found anywhere in HAL libraries) and HAL functions were stopping. I turned out flags checkout in FLASH_WaitForLastOperation. And after that MCU is not responding on any try to connect. Reference manual says, that if this flags are on, flash operations just will not be performed, but my MCU is not working and I cannot connect to it with ST-LINK Utility (and Programmer as well) even with reset pin. So what could happen and is there any way to reanimate my MCU?
