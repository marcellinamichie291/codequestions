# Limit Git Tab Autocompletion

I recently upgraded my laptop and have been making sure my developer workflow is how I'm used to. Everything has been working fine except Git tab autocompletion.
Normally I can type git che then hit tab and it will autocomplete to git checkout.
For whatever reason, on my new laptop, it does not do that. Now it will list every option that starts with "che" (check-attr, check-ignore, cherry, cherry-pick, etc.)
I've read a bunch but can't seem to figure what is (a) causing this (b) how to change it.
Specs:
Laptop - Macbook Pro M1
Shell - zsh
Note:
I think it may have to do with Zsh's tab-completion library but not sure how to change it.
I've read documentation and updated zshrc files
Added and removed:
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
