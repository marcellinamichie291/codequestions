# How to input a matrix and receive value (or array of values) using machine learning in Python?

So I've been learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning using sklearn. I've come to a problem I want to solve using this knowledge:
I have a bunch of binary 8x15 matrixes and I want to determine which index (row and column) of the matrix breaks the pattern.
Say I have the following matrix (simplified to 5x5 for ease, because the problem remains the same):
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0

This matrix should return [3, 3], because that position breaks the pattern of filling the matrix column by column with 1.
The following example should return [3, 1]:
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0

The following example, however, doesn't show that problem, so it should return [-1, -1] or something (suggestions?):
1 1 1 1 0 
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0

How should I approach this problem using machine learning / artificial intelligence?
Currently, I have a pandas dataframe with 2 columns: the first one contains the matrix (so an array of 8 arrays of 15 positions; therefore, 8x15 matrix), while the second one contains the expected return / result:
                      State                                  Result
0   [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]...   [-1, -1]
1   [[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]...   [-1, -1]
2   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]...   [-1, -1]
3   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]...   [-1, -1]
4   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]...   [-1, -1]

dtypes:
State     object
Result    object
dtype: object

So one entry of the dataframe above would have the first column with a value like:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

And its second column would have the value [6, 3].
Then I split it in 2 dataframes, X and y:
X = states_data.drop(columns=['Result'])
y = states_data[['Result']]

After that, I tried to use DecisionTreeClassifier with sklearn to solve the problem:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2)
X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)
y_train = y_train.reset_index(drop=True)
y_test = y_test.reset_index(drop=True)

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns = ['Result'])

score = accuracy_score(y_test['Result'], predictions['Result'])
print(score)

However, in this line:
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

I get this error:
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'list'

Can someone help me? What am I doing wrong?
Some additional information:
X_train.dtypes returns:
State    object
dtype: object

y_train.dtypes returns:
Result    object
dtype: object

Both X_train.shape and y_train.shape return:
(543, 1)

Thanks!
