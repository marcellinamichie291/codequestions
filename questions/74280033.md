# Blob MIME type incorrect for JPEG image

I'm trying to fetch a local jpg image and convert to blob. The expected MIME type for the blob is "image/jpeg" but my logs are showing it is "text/html". Please let me know if I should add additional parameters to the code below to ensure it returns a blob in the correct type:
const image = fetch('../images/image.jpg')
        .then((res) => res.blob())
        .then(async(myBlob) => {
            console.log(myBlob);
            //Do stuff with myblob... should be in "image/jpeg" type but showing as "text/html"
        });
