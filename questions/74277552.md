# It's possible to use ("fs" && "path") from node.js, on react-native application?

i'm trying to do this below (node.js) in react-native. For understanding, I'm acessing a existing folder in my C:, creating a new folder called "logs" inside the existing folder, and creating a .txt inside it. This code works fine.
const fs = require("fs");
let os = require("os");
const path = require("path");

const regex = /[\/|:]/g;
const date = new Date();
const value = date.toLocaleString().replace(regex, "-");

const homeDir = os.userInfo().homedir;
const pathValue = `${homeDir}\\AppData\\Roaming\\everysfa-host-app`;
const directory = path.join(pathValue, `logs`);
const result = "test"

if (!fs.existsSync(directory)) {
  fs.mkdir(directory, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("sucesso");
  });
}

fs.writeFile(
  path.join(pathValue, "logs", `${value}.txt`),
  result,
  (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("sucess");
  }
);

But I need to implement this on react-native (I'm using expo too), and I running this on web from expo, and not on an android or ios emulator. I already try to use 'react-native-fs', but I'm not even able to import the library, there are some errors that I'm not able to resolve.
My doubt is: It's possible to reproduce this on react-native ? acess user "C:" directory, on a specific folder and create/update files inside it ? Or this is not possible in react-native ?
*Remembering that I'm opening on the web with expo
