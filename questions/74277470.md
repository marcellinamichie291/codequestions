# How does the -v function of the cat utility work?

I am implementing the -v function of the cat utility, but I have a question, what non-printable characters should I print in the code other than the obvious ones, TAB- ^I and the end of the line - $?
I tried to search more for a detailed description and examples of using -v, but I could not find anything useful, I also tried to change the -v function, but I get my text back unchanged.
