# Can I send an email with my IP as the domain?

So if I take my public IP
Ex. 12.34.56.78
Then is there a way for me to send emails from the alias of noreply@12.34.56.78?
If so do I need to setup a custom email server?
I don't need to receive emails just send them.
Also if it won't work, how come?
TY
