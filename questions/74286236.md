# Custom info in Jmeter dashboard

Trying to add my own table to Jmeter dashboard report. In Jmeter it's not clear enough. Tried as in https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html#customs_graphs
but the custom part doesn't appear in dashboard. Would appreciate your help and examples.
