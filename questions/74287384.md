# how to detect root status in android device

I created an app and added root detection. I searched it on internet and discussed it on some forums, but nothing works. Can someone help me about this issue?
I tried these several possibility solutions:

RootBeer
DetectMagiskHide
Boot loader detection
Anti Frida

I tested it on this version of Magisks: Magisk 25.2, Magisk Delta
I hope that anyone able to help me about this issue.
Thank youu and I appreciate it so much for the answers!
