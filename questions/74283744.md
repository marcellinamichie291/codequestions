# Python HVPLOT In a future version of pandas a length 1 tuple will be returned when iterating over a groupby with a grouper equal to a list of length 1

I am working on a data visualization using Python's Pandas, hvplot, and Panel libraries.
I am able to shape the dataframe as I want, but when it comes to plotting this in hvplot. I start getting the following errors:
/home/****/_git/data-science-books/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/holoviews/core/data/pandas.py:231: FutureWarning: In a future version of pandas, a length 1 tuple will be returned when iterating over a groupby with a grouper equal to a list of length 1. Don't supply a list with a single grouper to avoid this warning.
  data = [(k, group_type(v, **group_kwargs)) for k, v in

If I supply multiple params to the 'by' param in hvplot, I don't get errors, but the chart is broken.
Any thoughts?
The preprocessing steps clean a series of books in .txt files into a pandas dataframe that looks like the following: (each word in the book is stored in the 'words' column)





words
book_title
publish_date
author
genre
country_of_origin

Then we make the DF interactive for hvplot and panel.
imaster = master.interactive()
Create a pipeline for hvplotting.
colors = ['white', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet', 'purple']

pipeline = (
    imaster[
        (imaster.publish_date >= year_range_slider.value[0]) &
        (imaster.publish_date <= year_range_slider.value[1]) &
        (imaster.words.isin(colors))
         ]
    .drop(['country_of_origin', 'book_title', 'author'], axis=1)
    .rename(columns={"genre":"word_count"})
    .groupby(['publish_date','words']).count()
)

It's when I attempt to plot this that I start to see issues. It appears that I get 2 identical errors each time I call hvplot. The first pair on the line plot, the second pair on the scatter plot, and the third pair when I combine them into 'color_plot'
color_plot_line = pipeline.hvplot.line(x ='publish_date', by='words', y='word_count', title='Colors by Year')
color_plot_scatter = pipeline.hvplot.scatter(x ='publish_date', by='words', y='word_count', title='Colors by Year')
color_plot = color_plot_line * color_plot_scatter
color_plot

I have tried to adjust the 'by' param to include a list longer than 1. This stops the error, but does not produce the plot as expected.
color_plot_line = pipeline.hvplot.line(x ='publish_date', by=['words', 'word_count'], y='word_count', title='Colors by Year')
Sending a single value into 'by' produces the plot, but also the errors.
Current plot (not well hydrated data):
