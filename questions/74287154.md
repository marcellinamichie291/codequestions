I am looking for a way to record the timings of multiple queries running in excel.
Preferably I would like all queries to refresh using refresh all then produce a separate table with the query names and duration of running time per query.
I have tried two methods currently but neither are doing exactly what I want:
Method 1
Time within the table

Result
This method didn't seem to work because apparently excel doesn't run the steps in the order noted on the right side of the query editor so the timings recorded at the start and end of the query was only a few seconds different when in real time they could be minutes apart.
Method 2
Time outside of table

This method seemed to work accurately but I couldn't find a way to add the time to the table without duplicating the query therefore doubling the real time to refresh.
Can anyone think of a way I can produce what I am after, either via a different method or by adjusting one of the above methods?
