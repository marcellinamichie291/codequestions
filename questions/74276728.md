# Is it possible to animate individual draw calls in a CALayer?

I'm drawing in a single CALayer between 100 and up to 1000 dots (colored circles actually) in a grid, when each dot state changes from hidden to shown and viceversa. So this layer is drawn quite a lot. The reason I went with a single layer and not 1000 layers is because I think performance would be hit with so many layers. Now I want to animate the dissappearance of (maybe multiple) dots over 2 seconds, a fade-off. Is that possible to do for each individual draw call?
