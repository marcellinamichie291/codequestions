how to send a data object using fetch when the used method is GET?
i tried body method but, the browser compiler tells me "GET/HEAD" can't have a body
this was my code:
var myHeaders = new Headers();
var raw = JSON.stringify({
  "token": "<secret>"
});

var requestOptions = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: myHeaders,
  body: raw,
  redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://www.quickly-egypt.com/api/v1/client/address/all", requestOptions)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log('error', error));

tried sending data using GET method and it failed
