# Send index value on phx_change in Phoenix

Is it possible to send the index of the form to the handle_event in select input as we do in phx-click as shown below?
  def handle_event(
        "change_event",
        %{"event" => event},
        %{"index" => index},
        socket
      )

            <.button
              type="button"
              color="transparent"
              phx-target={@myself}
              phx-click="remove"
              phx-value-index={fv.index}
            >
              <span class="material-icons">delete</span>Remove
            </.button>

Is it possible to do this with a select input in Phoenix?
