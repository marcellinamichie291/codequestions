# Why 'series' object is not callable?

I have an assignment that needs to assign df_confirmed_local to a DataFrame of confirmed cases that are local or epidemiologically linked with a local case, but when I run my code, it raises an error.
df_confirmed_local = df_covid.loc\[
(df_covid\["Confirmed/probable"\] == "Confirmed")
& (df_covid\["Case classification\*"\] == 'Local case')(
df_covid\["Case classification\*"\] == "Epidemiologically linked with local case"
)
\]

df_confirmed_local
