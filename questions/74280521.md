# How to desplay a waiting message while only one client is connected and running the game when both players are connected?

I have made a multiplayer connect4 using pygame and socket.it's working fine but I want to display a waiting message while only one client is connected and when 2 clients are connected i want to run the main game although display the main game board in both of clients screens.
In the server side i keep track of all the clients who joins. when the second client connects i send a message to all the clients and then in the client side i  set the varible all_connected which is by defult False to True.
and then in my main function i have said if all_connected is False , fill the background color with blue and display a text saying 'waiting for the other player to join' and else if all_connected is True then call the function which contains the main game_board. but it's not working fine.
it basicly shows the waiting message when one client is connected as it's supposed to , but when the other client joins in , the main gameboard displays on the second client's screen but not the first client's. the first client's screen doenst get updated.
I dont know how to fix this problem ? any idea?
update :
here is when the clients recive data from the server.

def client_recive():

    while True : 
        try : 
            message = client.recv(1024).decode()
            oppon = message.split('-')
            print('reciving:' ,oppon)


            #if the first client connected :
            if oppon != [''] and oppon[0] == 'red':
                board.running = True 
                #print(board.running)
                board.player_num = int(oppon[2])
                print(board.all_connected()) #will print False here 
              
            #if second client connected : 
            if  oppon != [''] and oppon[0] == 'yellow' : 
                board.player = oppon[0]

                board.player_num = int(oppon[2])
                print(board.connected()) #will print True here 
            
                your_turn = True
            
                #client.send(board.player.encode('utf-8'))
            elif message == "Connection overflow. Max amount is 2":
                
                
                client.close()
                board.running = False
                pygame.quit()
                break
