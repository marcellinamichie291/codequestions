# $testnext[1]=$test[1]+anyvalue but $test[1] change value follow $testnext[1] too and value chang outside function

This is my first post over on stackoverflow.I still didn't get the body section since i actually testing 3 thing here not one.If i did something inappropriate,please advice.
i actually find the work around to fix my problem.but i want my code to be cleaner so it easier to review.
i even write short script on empty file with just the following code
here the output:
before function 150
before operation 150
after operation 151
random array work just fine 151
after 2nd operation 152
restored for next loop 150
after quit function 152
if not restore value before quit function the value is still 152 which shouldn't be the case
I have 2 issue here.Why do $test[1] change value follow $testnext[1].As you can see if i do the same with other arrays the $test[1] value is intact.
And why does $test[1] value change after quit function?Even if i restore value inside the function first it still change.It should be the same as before enter function regardless of how the value change inside that function.I also didn't declare scope or anything
$test=('150','150')
'before function '+$test[1]
function provemypoint{
    $minus=1
    $testnext=$test
    'before operation '+$test[1]
    $testnext[1]=[int]$test[1]+$minus
    'after operation '+$test[1]
    $random=('150','150')
    $random[1]=[int]$test[1]+$minus
    'random array work just fine '+$test[1]
    $testnext[1]=[int]$test[1]+1
    'after 2nd operation '+$test[1]
    $test=('150','150')
    'restored for next loop '+$test[1]
}
provemypoint
'after quit function '+$test[1]
