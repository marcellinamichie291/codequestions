I am planning to build a website but I will require to use data from database that i already have in mysql. I was wondering if there was any way to access that data through php or do I have to find some other way.
I tried most of the things i found regarding php code like
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

try {
  $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=myDB", $username, $password);
  // set the PDO error mode to exception
  $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
  echo "Connected successfully";
} catch(PDOException $e) {
  echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>

but there is something wrong on my system. Is there an easier way to do this on php or any other language?
