# converting string into mathematical function in tcl

Let's say I have a string, maybe "Enable && Signal" for simplicity's sake.
I'd like to convert this string to standard && operations in tcl, such that Enable && Signal would return   0 if any of the value is false and 1 only when both are true.
Is there an easy way to do this, As for my case i would need a generic method where the number of arguments can be any and perform logical/relational operations like && || == <= > != etc
Any help and insights would be very much appreciated.
Thanks
I initially tried to split the arguments into conditions list and data list but could not handled the precedence of operations. Like == need to be done first and later && operations for n^n combinations
