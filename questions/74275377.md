# How REST API works?

enter image description here
What this picture actually describes?
I have a confusion, which is, whenever we are sending a GET request to the server via a API,
are we sending it in JSON format ?Or, in HTML or any simple Text format?
On the other hand, whenever the API is sending a request (HTTP verb actually) to the server, is it using HTTP format? and the server also returns a response in HTTP format or in JSON format?
I know this question is very silly....but I am very new in API world.
