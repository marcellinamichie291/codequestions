I am trying to extract a unique Id value in a cookie , am able to extract the whole cookie object but cannot retrieve the value alone
 Log into browser url
 ${cookie}= get cookie Id.  

Log to console ${cookie} returns the whole object
name -Id, value =abc
Domain =..
Path=
I just need to extract value abc.
Dictionary doesnâ€™t work
${pid}=    Get from dictionary  ${cookie} id

Can someone give an idea? Am very new to robot.
