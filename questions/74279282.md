# js leaflet extra makers displaying icon but not marker

My code for formatting a JS Leaflet Extra Marker is like below where I've clearly given a marker color
let parkMarkerIcon = L.ExtraMarkers.icon({
shape: 'circle',
markerColor: 'green',
prefix: 'fa-solid',
icon: 'fa-tree"',
iconColor: '#fff',
iconRotate: 0,
extraClasses: '',
number: '',
svg: false
});

However, I don't seem to be getting the marker, just the icon?
See below

Have I missed something?
I've tried looking at other working examples but they don't seem to include anything more than what I have above
