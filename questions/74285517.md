# Xcode: default Compile Sources for all new targets

I have a C++ project in Xcode. The code is split over several files (hpp and cpp).
I need to add several targets with different main files. However every time I add a new target, I need to manually add all the other source files into Build Phases/Compile Sources.
Is there a way to specify within Xcode that a list of cpp files are to be added by default to the Compile Sources list whenever a new target is created?
Thanks!
