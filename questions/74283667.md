I'm trying to figure out how to convert bases in Java.
For example, if I have 12 base 3 and want to convert it into base 10, how would I do that?
Is there any simple way to do it? I know some approaches require "parseInt" or "toString" but I don't know how those actually work, it'd be great if someone could explain it to me.
I've tried this:
beginning = Integer.toString(start);
            
            convert = Integer.toString(Integer.parseInt(beginning, base), 10);
            convert2 = Integer.parseInt(convert);
            convert2 = convert2 + inc;
            
            convert3 = Integer.toString(convert2);
            convert4 = Integer.toString(Integer.parseInt(convert3, 10), base);

I'm not sure how it works (or even if it does) though.
