# Calculating the average lifetime values of customers between specific timeframes in Postgres

In PostgreSQL I have an orders table that represents orders made by customers of a store, for example:
SELECT * FROM orders




order_id
customer_id
value
created_at




1
1
200.00
2021-01-05


2
1
150.00
2021-01-07


3
1
99.50
2021-06-05


4
2
100.00
2021-03-03


5
2
21.50
2022-02-01


6
2
10.00
2022-03-04


7
3
5.00
2022-06-06




(Note that the real table won't be ordered by customer_id and created_at.)
First, I need to get all customers that made an order between a specified timeframe, e.g. 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31. Using the data above, these are customers 1 and 2.
I then need to find the average value per customer over the following timeframes:

60-day
90-day
6-months
12-months

Customer 1's first purchase is 200.00 on 05-01-2021. We then need to add up the value of all purchases they made within 60-days, so 200.00 + 150.00 = 350.00.
For customer 2, the value of all purchases within 60 days of their first purchase is 100.00 (only their first purchase).
So, the average 60-day value per customer is (350.00 + 100.00) / 2 = 225.00.
We then need to do the same for 90-days, 6-months and 1-year from first purchase.
Final result should ideally look like this:




timeframe
av_value_per_customer




60-day
225.00


90-day
225.00


6-month
274.75


1-year
285.50
