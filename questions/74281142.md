# While loop in C prints the same line more than once

char ch;
int nr=0;

printf("\n: "); 
ch = getchar();

while(ch != 'q' && ch != 'Q'){
    ch = tolower(ch);
    if(ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'u')
        nr++;
    
    printf("something");
    ch = getchar();
}
    
printf("vocale: %d", nr);

its supposed to count the number of vowels until the user presses q or Q. it's such a silly program and yet i cant get past it.
