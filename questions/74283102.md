# Passing field value from Child to Parent Component onChange with React

I am working on a project with React for the first time. What I am trying to do is send a Child component's value that is within an input field to a variable in its Parent. More precisely, I would like the value to be transmitted whenever the value in the input field is changed. Here is a basic overview of what I have (simplified):
const Parent = () => {
   
   const handleSubmit = (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      // Series of variables to hold the values from Child2
   }
   
   return (
   <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <div>
            <Child1 name="child1"/>
            <Child1 name="child2"/>
         </div>
         <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
   </div>
   );
}

const Child1 = () => {
   
   return (
   <div>
      <Child2 name="childchild1"/>
      <Child2 name="childchild2"/>
      <Child2 name="childchild3"/>
   </div>
   );
}

const Child2 = () => {

   return (
   <div>
      <input type="number" .......></input>
   </div>
   );
}

In brief, my goal is to have the values from the input fields in the component Child2 to be transmitted to some array of values in Parent. That being said, I have looked at multiple ways of lifting up values in React online, but I haven't found something similar to my scenario. What would be the best way of proceeding? Thanks!
