[enter image description here][1]   I need to calculate the sum of the rows and columns of the matrix, but the program needs to ask which rows or columns need to be counted( I don't know how to explain in another way, because my english isn't well). Can someone explain how to do this?

#include<iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int A[10][10];
  int s = 0;
  cout << "Matrix:\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      A[i][j] = rand() % 10;
      cout << A[i][j] << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    s = s + A[0][i];
    s = s + A[9][i];
    s = s + A[i][0];
    s = s + A[i][9];
  }
  s = s - A[0][0] - A[9][0] - A[0][9] - A[9][9];
  cout << "\nAmount = " << s;
}
