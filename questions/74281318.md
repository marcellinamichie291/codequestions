# PySimpleGUI change cprint output destination with param:window

Have 2 Multiline elements in my window, 1 has param: reroute_cprint=True. When  "Add" button is pressed I want to print to the 2:nd Multiline.
Want to change the output destination for sg.cprint() in its paramaters, something like this:
if event == -B_ADD-':
        sg.cprint("Text to print", window=window['-ML_QUE-'])

Now I have a "workaround"
if event == -B_ADD-':
        sg.cprint_set_output_destination(window, '-ML_QUE-')
        sg.cprint("Text to print")
        sg.cprint_set_output_destination(window, '-ML_MAIN-')

Tried different key's in cprint param but get 'AttributeError', ex.
mline = destination_window.find_element(destination_key, silent_on_error=True)  # type: Multiline
AttributeError: 'Multiline' object has no attribute 'find_element'
What would be the right param to use?
