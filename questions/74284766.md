# How to print snake tail C++

So I am trying to make a snake game. Here is the code to print the tail:
if (size(prevPos) == 0) {
  j = 1;
} else {
  j = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < length + 1; i++) {
    prevPos[0][j] = prevPos[0][i];
    j++;
  }

  j = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < length + 1; i++) {
    prevPos[1][j] = prevPos[1][i];
    j++;
  }

  prevPos[0][0] = x;
  prevPos[1][0] = y;
}

for (int i = 0; i < length + 1; i++) {
  gotoxy(prevPos[0][i], prevPos[1][i]);
  std::cout << "S";
}

So it works for the first fruit, (extends the tail to by one character) but it stops working after the second fruit is eaten (I say first fruit at the beginning but in the game the first fruit is automatically eaten) I have no idea what I am doing wrong, please help. I am happy to elaborate.
