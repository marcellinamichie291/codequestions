In my flutter app i want to increase the font weight while enabled Bold Text in android Accessibility setting. I have used MediaQueryData.fromWindow(WidgetsBinding.instance!.window).copyWith(boldText: true) . But font text is not chaning. How to fix this issue? How to enable bold text when system font is bold?
When i am using  useInheritedMediaQuery: true Then the text became bold. But when i disabled bold text in android accessibility. Then also the text is bold.
My requirement is when "bold text" enabled then the text want to be bold. If it is disabled then the text wants to non bold .
