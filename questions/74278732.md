# How to get the real value of variable declared outside the loop, after using that varible in loop

I was working with loops and stuck with this problem.
I had declared a variable outside the main code and then used it in the loop but when i am retuning the value of that variable after that loop, I am unable to get that value again.
**INPUT **
`
int n;

int main () {

    // Sum of N natural numbers using FOR LOOP

          // 1st METHOD
    cin>>n;

    int sum = 0;

    for(int i=1 ; i<=n ; i++){
        sum=sum+i;
    }

    cout<<"\nThe sum of first "<<n<<" natural number is : "<<sum<<endl;


          // 2nd METHOD

    int sum4=0;
    for( n ; n>0 ; n--){
        sum4+=n;
    }

    cout<<"\nThe sum of first "<< :: n<<"  natural number is : "<<sum4<<endl;




    // Sum of N natural numbers using WHILE LOOP


    int sum1=0;
    while(n>0){
        sum1+=n;
        n--;
    }

    cout<<"\nThe sum of first "<<n<<" natural number is : "<<sum1<<endl;


    // Sum of N natural numbers using DO WHILE LOOP

    int sum2=0;
    do{
        sum2+=n;
        n--;
    } while(n>0);

    cout<<"\nThe sum of first "<<n<<" natural number is : "<<sum2<<endl;



    return 0;

}

`
OUTPUT
The sum of first 55 natural number is : 1540
The sum of first 0  natural number is : 1540
The sum of first **0 **natural number is : 0
The sum of first -1 natural number is : 0
Can I declare a universal variable and use it in a loop and at the same time after loop quits it does not change the value of that variable and gives the output as declared.
