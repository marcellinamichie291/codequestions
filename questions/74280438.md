# Why prolog gives 'false' at the end of a simple query?

I am just beginning to learn prolog:
% Doors

door(kitchen, office).

connect(X, Y) :- door(X, Y).
connect(X, Y) :- door(Y, X).


Now, when I consult:
?- connect(kitchen, office).
true ;
false.

?- connect(office, kitchen).
true.

?-

Why in the first query, prolog though there's more and had me press ';' ?
