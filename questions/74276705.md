# How can 2 apps that share the same database return different query results?

I am using Heroku and Prisma to host and manage my database. My Nextj app is hosted on Vercel. I am using NextAuth to manage User auth.
My database url looks something like this:
postgres://foo:bar@ec2.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/baz?schema=public&connection_limit=1&pool_timeout=20

I am using the same db (database url) for my local development as well as my deployed non-production preview app.
After creating the db in Heroku I run the prisma command to setup the tables:
npx prisma db push

And then seed the db with:
npx prisma db seed

Because I am still in the early stages of dev, when I make any schema changes I reset the db and run the push and seed commands again locally.
Everything was working as expected until this evening when the app running on my local was returning different db query results to the deployed preview app. I deleted the db and pushed and seeded it again but still they seem to be out of sync.
I logged the prisma client and saw that the schemas are different.
How can 2 apps (one local and one using Heroku and Vercel) that share the same cloud db be out of sync with different schemas?
I created a new db and updated the db url on Vercel but it is still returning the old / out of sync db schema.
What is going on and is there anything else I can do to debug this?
Does Heroku postgres db, Nextjs, or Vercel cache the db?
