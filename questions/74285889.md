# How to calculate mean absolute error horizontally(row-wise) on 2D numpy.array with sklearn.metrics?

I've tried to calculate mean_absolute error of all rows of an 2-D array. Here is my code:
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error as mae


arr = np.array([[1.7, 3.1], [2.1, 2.7], [0.9, 0.7], [0.3, 0.8]])
result_arr = np.apply_along_axis(mae, 0, arr[:, 0], arr[:,1])

However, I got result like that:
array(0.675)

I want to get mae values like this(row-wise):
array([[mae_value1],
       [mae_value2],
       [mae_value3],
       [mae_value4]])

By the way, I have to calculate mae with sklearn.metrics and without loop. Is there any efficient way to do this?
