# How to delay toast message until button pressed in kotlin

I'm currently working on a kotlin application, somewhere inside the app a toast message gets displayed onClick, but i need to be able to delay the message until the next button press. Any suggestions will be really appreciated.
According to kotlin documentations, toast delay timer only comes in two types;
//Toast.LENGTH_SHORT: lasts about 2seconds
//Toast.LENGTH_LONG: lasts about 3seconds

if (diceOneValue != diceTwoValue) { 
            val showToast = Toast.makeText(
                this,
                """You rolled $diceTwoValue & $diceOneValue,
                Count ${diceTwoValue + diceOneValue}!
            """.trimIndent(),
                **Toast.LENGTH_SHORT**
            )
            showToast.show()

        }

I need to be able to hold toast message until button is pressed, or close the toast message when button is pressed regardless of the delay time.
