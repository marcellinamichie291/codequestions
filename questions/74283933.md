I have a .txt file with 225 numbers and I want to turn it into a 2d int distances[15][15]; array. The first 15 numbers should go in row 1 then the next 15 into row 2 and so on. The text file is called distances.txt
If there's anyway you can explain it out so I can learn how to do this for the future it would be appreciated but if not no worries.
Thank you
Ive googled as much as I can think to google and nothing has worked.
