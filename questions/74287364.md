# Batch/bulk update MS word documents

I want to update the table of contents and the figure/table captions of 100+ word documents within one folder on my computer.
Can anyone help me out with a VBscript to update all the MS Word documents within one folder?
Thanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š
I already managed to do a batch convert from MS Word to PDF by using a VBscript via the following link: https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/how-to-batch-convert-word-documents-into-pdf-files/.
Besides, I recieved the VBA below but I need help to convert this to a VBscript:
Sub UpdateDocuments()
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Dim strFolder As String, strFile As String, strDocNm As String, wdDoc As Document
strDocNm = ActiveDocument.FullName: strFolder = GetFolder: If strFolder = "" Then Exit Sub
strFile = Dir(strFolder & "\*.doc", vbNormal)
Do While strFile <> ""
  If strFolder & "\" & strFile <> strDocNm Then
    Set wdDoc = Documents.Open(FileName:=strFolder & "\" & strFile, AddToRecentFiles:=False, Visible:=False)
    With wdDoc
      .Fields.Update
      .PrintPreview
      .ClosePrintPreview
      .Close SaveChanges:=True
    End With
  End If
  strFile = Dir()
Loop
Set wdDoc = Nothing
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub

Function GetFolder() As String
Dim oFolder As Object
GetFolder = ""
Set oFolder = CreateObject("Shell.Application").BrowseForFolder(0, "Choose a folder", 0)
If (Not oFolder Is Nothing) Then GetFolder = oFolder.Items.Item.Path
Set oFolder = Nothing
End Function
