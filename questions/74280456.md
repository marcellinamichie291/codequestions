I need to sort an array of numbers by looking first to their last digit first (and also comparing if another number in the array has the same last digit) and first digit second from minimum to maximum like bubble sort but with a twist.
For example: ()
array = {22,32,76,45,95,31,10,28,79,21}
return should be:
{10,21,31,22,32,45,95,76,28,79}
I've tried using this method down below but it gives numbers at random or sometimes to some extend correct.
Any help will be appreciated.
I did try this block of code:

#include <iostream>

bool checkNumber(int a,int b){
    // digits of A:
    int lastDigitA = a % 10; 
    int firstDigitA = (a - lastDigitA) / 10;
    // digits of B:
    int lastDigitB = b % 10;
    int firstDigitB = (b - lastDigitB) / 10;
    // checkif big or small:
    if(lastDigitA == lastDigitB){
        if(firstDigitA == firstDigitB){
            return true;
        }
        else if(firstDigitA < firstDigitB){
            return true;
        }
        else if(firstDigitA > firstDigitB){
            return false;
        }
    }
    else if(lastDigitA < lastDigitB){
        return true;
    }
    else if(lastDigitA > lastDigitB){
        return false;
    }
    return false;
}

int main()
{
    const int N = 10;
    int A[N] = {10,14,45,22,36,98,78,64,44,39};
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int temp = A[i];
        for (int j = N-1; j > i+1; j--) {
            if(checkNumber(A[i],A[j+1])){
                int min = A[j];
                A[j] = temp;
                A[i] = min;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        std::cout << A[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}


What i got:
{39, 36, 14, 64, 45, 98, 14, 14, 14, 22}
what i was expecting:
{10, 22, 14, 44, 64, 45, 36, 78, 98, 39}
