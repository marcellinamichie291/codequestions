# Append overflowed text input onto a new component in React

I'm trying to build a clone of MS Word/Google docs in React.
I'm stuck in the part where the editor creates a new page and appends the overflowed text from the current page onto a new page (See image for reference).

I've tried to think of an approach, but I can't get seem to get my head around it. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
