# How to run a Github Action in a configurable directory

I am trying to create a github action that allows you to run checks in a directory that can be configured by a user and entered in a config.yml file. This should be able to allow them to enter the file that they entered their information into and have the action do its tasks on the files there. I have tried to find ways to do this and there isn't a very clear way. Any suggestions? Thanks!
I tried to use input variables, but I haven't been able to find much of a way for this to be configured in the user's repository rather than the action's repository.
