# Firebase Dynamic Links doesn't navigate to deep link on iOS

Using Firebase Dynamic Links in a Managed Workflow Expo app directs to the correct deep link in the app on Android, but on iOS only opens the app in either whatever page was last open or the homepage.
app.config.js
ios: {
    associatedDomains: [
      'applinks:*.myapp.web.app',
      'applinks:myapp.web.app',
      'applinks:*.myapp.page.link',
      'applinks:myapp.page.link',
    ],
},

AppNavigation.js
  const linking = {
    prefixes: [
      prefix,
      'https://myapp.web.app',
      'https://*.myapp.web.app',
    ],

The apple-app-site-association file stored on myapp.web.app
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "1234567890.com.my.app",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            } 
        ]
    }
}

The Dynamic Link is generated using REST API with the following payload:
    const payload = {
      dynamicLinkInfo: {
        domainUriPrefix: 'https://myapp.page.link',
        link: `https://myapp.web.app/${deepLink}`,
        androidInfo: {
          androidPackageName: com.my.app,
        },
        iosInfo: {
          iosBundleId: com.my.app,
          iosAppStoreId: 1234567890,
        },

The generated Dynamic Link opens the app and directs to the ${deepLink} on Android as expected, but not on iOS. This was tested in an app built with EAS built.
