# Choose a point maximizing the distance to its nearest neighbor

Consider a set of points in an n-dimensional space. Add a new point as far away as possible from its nearest neighbor. Where should that point go?
Example: Consider an island containing cellular phone towers. Some areas of the island have service, and some areas do not have service. You are erecting a new tower. You could erect the new tower right next to an existing tower. This would provide coverage to the same area –– it would not improve the coverage area. Or you could erect the new tower as deep as possible in the largest uncovered area. This would yield the most improvement to the coverage area.
