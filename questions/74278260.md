# Getting problem while setting the position attribute of the Buffer Geometry

I am setting the position of position attributes of the buffer geometry using the Math.sin() and Math.cos() and I am getting this error

THREE.BufferGeometry.computeBoundingSphere(): Computed radius is NaN.
The "position" attribute is likely to have NaN values.


I am expecting no error and the simply can fill this value inside it
