Good day devs, is anyone here knows how to integrate influxdb to ReactJs? I just need a help regarding on my project. If someone here knows about these, please help me :( Thank you guys, God bless you all.
I tried to make a simple scheme of the database, it was sucessful . My problem is I can't figure out how to insert a data from reactjs(data froma value from textfield) to influxDb. I hope you'll help me with these. Thank you so much.
