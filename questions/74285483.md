# Spliting pdf based on range

i need solution in python language:
consider a pdf file with 10 pages within that each student have 5 pages within 10 pages all the pages are in order
i want to split the pdf file based on range(5 pages for each) and all 5 pages should save as single file
ex :
student1.pdf --> which contain first 5 pages(1 to 5 pages)
student2.pdf --> which contain next 5 pages (6 to 10 pages)
import os
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader,PdfFileWriter
path = input("write a file name to split:")
fname = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(path))[0]
pdf = PdfFileReader(path)
for page in range(pdf.getNumPages()):
    pdf_writer = PdfFileWriter()
    pdf_writer.addPage(pdf.getPage(page))
    output_filename = '{}.page_{}.pdf'.format(fname,page+1)
    with open(output_filename,'wb') as out :
        pdf_writer.write(out)
        print('created:{}'.format(output_filename))
