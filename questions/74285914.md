# Opentelemetry collector in development environment

We have several .net microservices running in docker containers.
In production we will be running the containers in kubernetes and using splunk with a splunk collector.
When developing we run the containers in docker desktop.
Is there a way that we can run a collector in docker desktop? Either the splunk collector or a compatible collector?
Due to security using splunk cloud collector is not an option.
