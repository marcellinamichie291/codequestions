# Gitlab runner different behavior than local env

I am not expert with Gitlab runners and I did not setup them in my current project.
I noticed that locally my Java Spring project returns an exception with a message that is slightly different from the exception returned in the Gitlab CI/CD. Why this happens?
My guess is that are two different environment, am I right?
Possible solution, create a similar env, how? Docker?
Thanks.
