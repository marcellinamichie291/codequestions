# Issue with nginx conf file

I am new to server deployment and currently deploying my auth app on azure server but facing issue with some of the APIs-
This is how my conf file looks like-
upstream admin_api {
   #server localhost:4445;
   server 127.0.0.1:4445; # for a web port socket (we'll use this first)
}

server {
    server_name openid.mydomain;
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/openid.mydomain/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/openid.mydomain/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
    location ~ ^/(clients|keys|health|metrics|version|oauth2/auth/requests|oauth2/introspect|oauth2/flush)/? {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://admin_api;
    }
}


server {
    if ($host = openid.mydomain) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


        listen 80;
        server_name openid.mydomain;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot


}

now when I curl this curl --location --request GET 'https://openid.mydomain/clients' url from postman I get Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4445
but when I do same on instance terminal it works fine.
Please help if possible
Thank You :)
