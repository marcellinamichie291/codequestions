How to use for_each twice in a terraform resource?
In the following I want to iterate over all ec2 instances and add multiple tags everywhere.
# get ec2 instances
data "aws_instances" "ec2" {
  instance_tags = {
    "aws:eks:cluster-name" = var.cluster_name
  }
}

# tag ec2 network interfaces
resource "aws_ec2_tag" "ecs_node_eni" {
  for_each = toset(data.aws_instances.ec2.ids)
  
  resource_id = data.aws_instances.ec2.ids[each.key]
  #for_each = var.node_tags
  #key      = each.key
  #value    = each.value  
}

My variable for the tags looks like this
node_tags = {
      Environment    = "dev"
      Owner          = "MyName"
      ProjectName    = "MyProject"
      AppID          = "MyAppId"
      CostReference  = "MyCostReference"
  }


With the approach shown, I'm iterating over the ec2 instances, but I don't know how to get all the tags in "var.node_tags" to the instances.
