# How to avoid conflicts when two tasks start at same time in c# while using aync await

When we call async method in another async method,
sometimes few of tasks getting into conflict.
If two tasks of EventReceiverAsync running at same time. For example getData(1) and getData(2) run parallely.
If getData(2) response is faster than getData(1). In this case objPayload taking getData(2) response even
for the task1.
Sometimes there is chance of conflict happens.

private async Task EventReceiverAsync(ID)
{
Payload objPayload = await getData(ID);
}


 private async Task<Payload> getData(string ID)
        {
Payload objOutput= new Payload ();
Response objResponse = await CallAPI("/api/getapidata", ID);
return objOutput;
}


Is there any way to categorize output based on task through any Id or something?
