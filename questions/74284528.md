# why no print() output for jupyter notebook when using VS Code?

I am using jupyter notebook to create plotly-dash dashboard application. and I am using VS Code to edit and run the notebook.
Here is one callback.
@app.callback(
    [
        Output("turtle-trader-plot-graph", "figure"),
        Output("turtle-trader-markdown", "children"),
    ],
    [
        Input('plot-turtle-trader','n_clicks')
    ],
             
    prevent_initial_call=True,   
)
 
        
def change_turtle_trader_plot(n_clicks):    
    fig_turtle_trader=create_turtle_trader_plot(ticker_input,start_str)  
    turtle_trader_markdown='Turtle Trader'    
    print('Done Creating Turtle Trader Plots')
    return (fig_turtle_trader,turtle_trader_markdown)

In the above callback, after running, it should print:
Done Creating Turtle Trader Plots
However I don't see any print() output in VS Code.
same thing if I have print() inside all other functions trying to give me more running information  for manual debugging purpose, I never be able to see print() output after using VS Code.
why?
