# How to correctly setup PyCharm for multi-package project?

I have a project consisting of two packages, which is currently structured in the following way:
ProjectRoot
|- first-package
   |- tests
   |- first-package-code-root
      |- code-folder-1
         |- code.py
      |- code-folder-2
         |- more_code.py
      |- main.py
   |- LICENSE
   |- pyproject.toml
   |- setup.cfg
   |- setup.py
|- second-package
   |- tests
   |- second-package-code-root
      |- code-folder-1
         |- additional-code.py
      |- code-folder-2
         |- code_too.py
      |- main.py
   |- LICENSE
   |- pyproject.toml
   |- setup.cfg
   |- setup.py
|- .gitignore
|- .pre-commit-config.yaml
|- README.md

tests folders are marked as Test Sources Root. The folders first-package-code-root and  second-package-code-root are marked as Sources Root.
Working on the code this works fine, however no that I have started to implement the first tests for the projects, running pytest will result in a

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some-project-module'
error.

The only solution I can think of currently is to pip-install the packages with pip install -e ".[dev]", however I guess this would defeat the purpose of marking the folders.
Is my project setup wrong? How should a setup like this one look?
Additional Information
I am using Anaconda as python environment and I am running pytest using pre-commit checks.
running the test directly (not using pre-commit), the tests run just fine.
