# How NestJS typeorm mongodb connect to local mongodb?

I am trying to run MongoDB on my mac local environment (terminal) but can't connect DB to my NestJS application.
The project is the following: https://github.com/hvpaiva/clean-architecture-nestjs
Instead of Postgres used in the example project, I need MongoDB.
