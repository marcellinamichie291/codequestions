# Creation of the aircraft structure and display on the console of all aircraft that have been in flight for more than 2 hours

A Plane structure with values is given:
Id(string)
Arrival_time(string)
leave_time(string)

Then inside the main function int main() output the elements
int N; //Number of planes to be input
cout << "Enter the number of planes: ";
cin >> N;
Plane My_plane[3]; //Create a structure plane in which I enter ID, arrival_time, leave_time. 

After this I can't figure out how to calculate arrival_time and leave_time to get the planes with flight time longer than 2 hours.
My code:
#include "iostream"
#include "string"
using namespace std;
struct Plane {
    string ID;
    string Arrival_time;
    string leave_time;
};

int main()
{
    string temp;
    int N;
    cout << "Enter the number of planes: ";
    cin >> N;
    Plane My_plane[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cout << "Enter plane name: ";
        cin >> My_plane[i].ID;
        cout << "Enter plane arrival_time: ";
        cin >> My_plane[i].Arrival_time;
        cout << "Enter plane leave_time: ";
        cin >> My_plane[i].leave_time;
    }
    
}

Here's the sample:
Input:
6
ABC 12:05 12:45 
FDR 12:00 12:30  
DWE 15:20 18:40  
OYH 12:00 12:10 
LQW 15:20 17:50  
BDF 12:15 15:43 

Output:
DWE 15:20 18:40
LQW 15:20 17:50
BDF 12:15 15:43
