# How to replace a specific value in all columns with a value that is the result of a function including the respective column for a big dataframe

I have a very big dataframe filled with integers from 1 to 4. For this dataframe, I want to replace all 1s with the median of the respective column where the median is computed by excluding the integer I want to replace (so 1).
Here is the dataframe:
df <- data.frame(matrix(sample(rep(c(1,2,3,4), 10000000)), nrow = 500))

I know this works:

for(i in 1:ncol(df)){
  
  df[,i][df[,i] == 1] <- median(df[,i][df[,i] != 1])
  print(i) # this is just to show how fast the loop is
  
}


And I know this works:

df <- df %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(across(everything(), 
                       ~case_when(. == 1 ~ median(.[. != 1]),
                                  TRUE ~ .)))


However, both approaches are too slow for my real dataset comprising of 570.000 columns. I am sure there is a faster way to do this operation for every column of a big dataframe. I looked into the *apply family but didn't see a verb that takes a data.frame as an input and yields a data.frame as an output.
Possible other functions I found but couldn't bring to work are: aggregate and by.
So my question: Is there a faster way to do this other than the two approaches I showed above, specifically for big dataframes with many columns?
