# 'flutter run' is not recognized as an internal or external command

I try to run 'flutter run' but it give me error :

I added the flutter to the Path, and it did recognized when I run 'flutter doctor'
what could be the problem that it not recognized the 'flutter run' ? I try it in cmd, in vs code.
