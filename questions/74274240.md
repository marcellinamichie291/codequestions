# How to change the value of a column (which contains NA values) by the sum of 2 other colums which also contain NA values in R?

#reproducible example data
data <- read.table(text = "Column_A Column_B Column_C
NA 0 2
7 5 2
2 NA 1", header = TRUE)
#   Column_A Column_B Column_C
# 1       NA        0        2
# 2        7        5        2
# 3        2       NA        1

Changing the values of A by the sum of B and C
I have tried this:
data$Column_A = replace(data$Column_A, is.na(data$Column_A), data$Column_B + data$Column_C)
data$Column_B = replace(data$Column_B, is.na(data$Column_B), data$Column_A - data$Column_C)
data$Column_C = replace(data$Column_C, is.na(data$Column_C), data$Column_A - data$Column_B)

But this didn't work, I thought of making a for-loop but I didn't know how to start doing that.
Is there anyone that could help me out?
