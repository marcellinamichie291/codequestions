# React - Button to open a Modal of Images

Right now I have a App set up to take in Hotels and Images, then a Component to display the Rooms, however some of the Hotels have more than one image so I want to display them in a Modal that pops up, however I'm not sure how to do this or even get the Modal component to display
I've included the code in question below and I have made a seperate Modal Component, this is all linked at the following codesandbox
