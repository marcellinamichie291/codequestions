# How to run single java files independently in Intellij IDEA or vscode?

I need to run single java files independently in Intellij IDEA or vscode.
Currently when I run a single program both IDEs checks for other files. For eg in the given image I need to run ReversingString program only but it doesnt run it and asks me to correct error in other java files.
How can I run a single file while ignoring other files. I checked answers to other similar questions here like editing run configuration but nothing is working.
Please help.
I want all files in this folder to be independent/separate from each other.
