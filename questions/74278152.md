# how can we add blank spaces between a number of integer which is then converted from a string?

I am trying to make a program which takes in value from an api an I have coded it to reduce it to 1 single value. But then it is returning me 5 different values. But after even accepting that too, I am facing a problem in which I am not able to convert the data extracted from the API in integer form.
So this is my code:
import requests
import json
import pprint
import time

url = "https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/1827200/fields/2.json?api_key=IVIRLPBRZ121YIGL&results=1"

def data_extraction():
response = requests.get(url).text # the raw data we get from the website
data = json.loads(response) # that data converted into json format

raw_feeds = data["feeds"]

feeds = []
feeds = (raw_feeds[0])

tds = feeds["field2"]

string_tds = str(tds)

print(string_tds)

string_tds = string_tds.replace("ppm", "")
string_tds = string_tds.replace("\n", "")
string_tds = string_tds.replace("\r", "")

int_tds = int(string_tds)
print(string_tds)

data_extraction()

I am trying to convert the string_tds value to an integer and even though it is converted into an integer, it has removed all the spacing between the values.
I want a favor from someone which can be done in 2 ways:

By making the no. of values it is returning to 1.
Getting spaces between the individual numbers when we print int_tds as we get in string_tds.
