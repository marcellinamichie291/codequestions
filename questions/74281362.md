# How to randomise a dictionary and blit it onto an image in pygame?

so I'm making a cooking game in python using pygame and one of the problems right now is that my orders aren't displaying on the image I wanted it to.
I put some of my orders into a dictionary and tried to reshuffle it using the random method, and then I converted it to a string to be able to blit it onto the image to. BUT, its not working and I dont know why, I'm still pretty new to pygame and python so any help is appreciated :)
Also here's my code so far which involves the grill game_state (aka the area where the order screen is located):
