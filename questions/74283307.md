# GPU accelerated PNG encoding in OpenCV

PNG encoding in OpenCV on CPU is much slower than real time frame rate, e.g. 5Mp image im takes over 200ms on a modern PC with these settings:
cv2.imwrite("f.png", im, [cv2.IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_RLE])

Is there a GPU accelerated version, which can encode 5Mp images at 10fps or better with similar compression ratio as above?
