# Gem5 Stable 22.0 X86MinorCPU not included by default

Is there a reason why an X86MinorCPU was not included with the recent change to CPU models?
Is there anything wrong with just adding it to X86CPU.py ?
from m5.objects.BaseMinorCPU import BaseMinorCPU



class X86MinorCPU(BaseMinorCPU, X86CPU):
    mmu = X86MMU()
