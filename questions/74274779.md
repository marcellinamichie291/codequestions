# Power Automate: Using "Wait for image" and "Extract text with OCR" in unattended mode possible?

I want to automate a Webswing session to run in unattended mode. Webswing is a web server that allows applications to run within the web browser. So there is no access to UI elements that the bot could access.
Therefore, I initially worked with image recognition (e.g., using the "Wait for image" and "Extract text with OCR" actions) in attended mode. Now I would like to switch to unattended mode. Does anyone have experience with this and know if the image recognition actions in a session like Webswing can be applied to unattended robots or are there other commands I can use for this use case?
