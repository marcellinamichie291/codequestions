# Android Unit Tests run slow when run together, but fast individually

Generally speaking, would there be any go-to reasons for this type of problem? If I run the tests one by one, they'll take 20 seconds max, but if I run them all together the tests take upwards of 3 mins each.
I've tried looking around the internet but couldn't find anything.
