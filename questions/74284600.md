# How to convert HTMLElement to its tag name

I have an array of different HTMLElement tags such as HTMLParagraphElement, HTMLDivElement and etc.
Is there a way to convert HTMLParagraphElement to 'p' or simply compare them somehow?
Basically I'm looking for a way to compare, so statements like HTMLDivElement === "div", HTMLParagraphElement === "p" become true.
function findTag(tagName) {
  const nodes = []
  
  var all = document.getElementsByTagName("*");

  for (let i=0; i < all.length; i++) {
      // here i'm trying to compare tag to an HTMLElement. 
      // If it corresponds such as 'p' = HTMLParagraphElement, I want to push it into 'nodes' array.
  }
  
  return nodes
}

console.log(findTag('p'));
