# Loading local files into wxPython's WebView

How do I make wx.html2.WebView load and use/display files stored locally on my hard drive?
The application I'm making doesn't need any internet connectivity whatsoever, but I want to use a WebView control with some external scripts, images, etc., stored locally on the file system somewhere. However, there seem to be some "security restriction" built into the underlying backend (MS Edge (Chromium) on Windows 10), which I don't know how to override. The minimal example:
import wx
import wx.html2

class MainWindow(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, id, title):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, wx.ID_ANY, title, size=(500, 500), style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE|wx.NO_FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE)
        self.html = wx.html2.WebView.New(self)
        
        content = "<html><head></head><body><p>Hello!</p><img src=\"file:///C:/absolute/path/to/hello.png\"></body></html>"
        self.html.SetPage(content, "")
                
        self.main_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        self.main_sizer.Add(self.html, 1, wx.EXPAND)        
        self.SetSizer(self.main_sizer)

app = wx.App()
frame = MainWindow(None, -1, "The App")
frame.Show(1)
app.MainLoop()

Here, instead of the image being displayed I get the "broken picture" placeholder; if I right-click on that and copy its URL, said URL is about:blank#blocked. Local images are displayed if I load a local HTML file with the LoadURL() function, but not with the SetPage() function (but I can't use LoadURL() because I want to manipulate the content at runtime). Images from the Internet are displayed even with SetPage(). Same goes for JS scripts and, I assume, any other kind of local files. Scripts I can at least load with Python and then directly embed into the resulting HTML string, however stupid and inefficient that may be; not sure if a trick like that is possible for images. Another workaround could be to run a local server in a different process to serve those files (images from local URLs like http://192.168... work OK), but that looks like an overkill, too.
I've had a similar problem with PyQt5's QtWebEngineWidgets class, it wouldn't load local resources, to solve that I had to add sys.argv.append("--disable-web-security") before actually starting the application. But, although the same command line switch seems to be present for Chromium, adding that same line didn't change anything for wxPython, be that because the switches for Edge are actually different, or because wxPython handles those keys different (if at all), or because of whatever other reason.
And while we're at it, could someone explain to me what kind of "security" is achieved through those restriction? The (potentially malicious) application is already running on the target system, it can already access the files - forbidding to pass those files to the browser component could save you from what?
