# Xamarin.Android hyperlink in middle of text not working

Goal: Have a word in the middle of a sentence be a hyperlink that opens the website in a browser
What's happening: It looks like a hyperlink, but nothing happens when I click
What I've tried:

I tried making it an intent, that worked to make it clickable, but it made the entire
sentence clickable.
Also, I then switched to using the Html.FromHtml method.

C#:
string Content = "<span>Please navigate to <a href='https://www.website.com'>HERE</a> to register</span>";
lblTESTSystem.TextFormatted = Html.FromHtml(Content); //lblTESTSystem.SetText(Html.FromHtml(Content, FromHtmlOptions.ModeLegacy), TextView.BufferType.Spannable);

What the above code looks like:

Alternate/first C# code that made entire sentence clickable:
//lblTESTSystem.Click += (sender, eventArgs) => 
//{
//    var uri = Android.Net.Uri.Parse("https://www.website.com");
//        var intent = new Intent(Intent.ActionView, uri);
//        StartActivity(intent);
//};
