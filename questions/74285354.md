# Decimal First Price Entry


is there a way to achieve a PayPal like 'decimal-first' entry in  Xamarin Forms?

I hope the screenshot is self explanatory. I basically want an instantaneous division of the input by 100. For an input of e.g. 3,85 I want it shown as
0,03
0,38
3,85
Is there a good way to implement this in Xamarin Forms?
Tanks in advance
