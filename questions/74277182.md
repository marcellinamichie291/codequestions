# Are android, ios pip mode is only for the video playback?

I am a 5+ years web developer and I am trying to develop an app which supports pip mode using react-native.
Since I have only a minimum understanding of app development, I've read through the android documentation but still I want to ask 2 things.
According to the android pip documentation (https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture),

PiP is a special type of multi-window mode mostly used for video playback

1. Is pip mode only for the video playback?
What I want to do is just to show a certain UI (character) in the right bottom corner of the screen. It definitely is not a video, so I am curious if it is okay to proceed with this approach (pip mode)
2. If pip mode is not only for the video playback, is pip mode switches app into the background mode?
While showing a certain UI in pip mode, still I want to do some calculation in my app.
But as I know, if an app goes into the background mode, there comes a limit calling an external APIs. so if it is in background mode, I will just do the client-side calculation.
I am sorry for asking this question for the native app developers if it is too basic.
Anyway, appreciate in advance for your help.
P.S)
I found this question, Is it possible to use PIP mode which is not for videos?
but I think this is only for the web.
if it is for the video also in the app, is it possible to execute some calculations while playing videos?
