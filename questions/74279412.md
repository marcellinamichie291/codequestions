# Bicep Template for NIC breaks internet access when adding in Load Balancer Configuration

I am trying to deploy the network interface card for a SQL Server VM, that will be placed as part of an AlwaysOn Availability Group and subsequently should be added to my Internal Load Balancer. This card will be created in advance of the VM itself.
My problem is that when the VM is created and the pre-created NIC is attached as part of the deployment, internet access for the VM doesn't seem to work.

I have tried created a NIC in the portal manually and attaching to the VM/Load Balancer manually and that seemed to work fine.
For reference, I have deployed a similar template to a different VM that doesn't require the NIC to be part of the backend address pool and that deploys no problem.
Do I need to add more properties than just a reference to the resourceId of the backend address pool in the load balancer to get this working?
