# How to calculate amortized costs from AWS CUR reports & match with cost explorer (aws console)?

I am trying to calculate amortized costs from aws cost & usage reports (cur) for the billing period using the query mentioned in Well Architected Labs (https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_cur_queries/query_help/) but I am not getting the right numbers.
I can fetch the costs from cost explorer api directly but that won't match with cur data because cur is usually a day or two behind. How to get the exact amortized costs for the billing period using cur queries?
I am trying the following query that I got from the above mentioned link in well architected labs. This query is for account with have both ri & sp usage during billing period.
SELECT
  DATE(lineitemusagestartdate) as month_line_item_usage_start_date,
  SUM(CASE
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanNegation') THEN 0 
      ELSE lineitemunblendedcost 
    END) AS sum_line_item_unblended_cost,
  SUM(CASE
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanCoveredUsage') THEN (safe_cast(savingsplansavingsplaneffectivecost as FLOAT64))
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanRecurringFee') THEN (safe_cast(savingsplantotalcommitmenttodate as FLOAT64) - safe_cast(savingsplanusedcommitment as FLOAT64))
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanNegation') THEN 0
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanUpfrontFee') THEN 0
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'DiscountedUsage') THEN (safe_cast(reservationeffectivecost as FLOAT64))
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'RIFee') THEN (safe_cast(reservationunusedamortizedupfrontfeeforbillingperiod as FLOAT64) + CAST(reservationunusedrecurringfee as FLOAT64))
      WHEN ((lineitemlineitemtype = 'Fee') AND (reservationreservationarn <> '')) THEN 0 
      ELSE lineitemunblendedcost 
    END) AS amortized_cost,
    SUM(CASE
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanRecurringFee') THEN (-(safe_cast(savingsplanamortizedupfrontcommitmentforbillingperiod as FLOAT64)))
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'RIFee') THEN (-(safe_cast(reservationamortizedupfrontfeeforbillingperiod as FLOAT64)))
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanNegation') THEN (-(safe_cast(lineitemunblendedcost as FLOAT64))) 
      ELSE 0 
    END) AS ri_sp_trueup,
    SUM(CASE
      WHEN (lineitemlineitemtype = 'SavingsPlanUpfrontFee') THEN lineitemunblendedcost
      WHEN ((lineitemlineitemtype = 'Fee') AND (reservationreservationarn <> '')) THEN lineitemunblendedcost 
      ELSE 0 
    END) AS ri_sp_upfront_fees
