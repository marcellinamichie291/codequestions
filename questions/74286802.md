# Copy specific rows to another sheet

I'm having a problem with copying specific rows, that aren't of constant number to another sheet. My main sheet consits of cells that determine where is next section of rows by color (colored cell marks the beginning, and another one marks the end). The main problem is that rows when selected through checkboxes aren't copied in a way they should - one section below another. So far it looks like that:  bad ,whereas it should look like this: good. My code now:
 Sub copytherows(clf As Long, lastcell As Long) 'clf - cell that marks the start, lastcell - ending cell
   
Dim st As Long, cnext As Range, wshet As Worksheet, wshetend As Worksheet
'st - start of looking up, cnext - range of lines, wshet - worksheet
Dim coprange As String
Dim cnextcoprow, cnextrow As Long

Set wshet = Worksheets(1)
Set wshetend = Worksheets(2)
For st = 1 To wshet.Cells(Rows.Count, "B").End(xlUp).Row
    If wshet.Cells(st, "B").Interior.Color = clf Then 'has the color of interest
         cnextcoprow = st
        Set cnext = wshet.Cells(st, "B").Offset(1, 0)            'next cell down
        
        Do While cnext.Interior.Color <> lastcell
            Set cnext = cnext.Offset(1, 0) 'next row
        Loop
        st = st + 1
        
   
    End If
Next st
  cnextrow = cnext.Row - 1
    coprange = cnextcoprow & ":" & cnextrow
    If Not Range("B" & Rows.Count).Interior.ColorIndex = xlColorIndexNone Then ***copybelow***
   wshet.Range(coprange).Copy wshetend.Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(1)
    MsgBox cnext.Row
    
    
End Sub

Please note that place where copybelow is typed should be something like move row below in the destination sheet (at least that's what I thought about when my mind went blank and decided to ask here).
Thanks in advance !
