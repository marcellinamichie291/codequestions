# docker connection refused between client and server

The container for the server image runs well.
I ran client.py on my local computer and it connects well with the server container.
(Originally, an error occurred, but when binding, I treated the host part with '' and solved the error.)
But I can't run the client image.
Every time I try, it says that the connection is refused.
This is the error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/you/client.py", line 10, in <module>
    clientSocket.connect((HOST, PORT))
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused

The way I talk can be weird because I used a translator.  sorry.
I use windows10.. I want to connect two containers T.T
