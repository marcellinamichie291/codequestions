# How do I check out a remote Git branch?

Somebody pushed a branch called test with git push origin test to a shared repository. I can see the branch with git branch -r. How do I check out the remote test branch? I've tried:

git checkout test, which does nothing
git checkout origin/test gives * (no branch)
