# Unable to see X-Ray traces from AWS Batch job

I am running a batch job that starts an EC2 instance and runs a Java application, and I am trying to generate X-Ray trace for the job. I am unable to see any traces after the job is completed.
In my docker entrypoint I install X-Ray daemon and start it
curl https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-xray-assets.us-west-2/xray-daemon/aws-xray-daemon-3.x.rpm -o /tmp/xray.rpm
yum install -v -y /tmp/xray.rpm
xray -o -n us-west-2 &

My Java code is instrumented as such
try {
    Segment segment = AWSXRay.beginSegment("load-data-segment");
    logger.info("Segment started traceID={}, segment", segment.getTraceId(), segment.prettySerialize());
    Subsegment subSegment = AWSXRay.beginSubsegment("load-data-sub-segment");
    logger.info("started subSegment traceId={}, {}", subSegment.getTraceId(), subSegment.prettySerialize());
    subSegment.putAnnotation("job_id", "load-data-job");
    ...
} finally {
    logger.info("Ending subsegment {}, {}", subSegment.getTraceId(), subSegment.prettySerialize());
    AWSXRay.endSubsegment();
    logger.info("Ending segment {}, {}", segment.getTraceId(), segment.prettySerialize());
    AWSXRay.endSegment();
}

And I can see from CloudWatch log that the daemon is installed and started, and the segments are created and eventually terminated normally.

However I am completely unable to find any tracing from X-Ray console. I use the queries like annotation.job_id, but nothing shows up. I think I have all the necessary polices added to my role (AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess), but I am suspecting if I didn't set it up properly. Where and how can I start debugging this? I feel like completely at wits' end. Thank you for any suggestions!
