# After using pyarmor, it then shows no module named "XX"

am using
pyarmor pack --clean -e "--onefile" main.py
After Running the Compiled .py file I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<dist \obf\ Builder19948 .py>", line 3, in 
File " ", line 7, in <module
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keyboard"
[12560] Failed to execute script *Builder19948 due to unhandled exception!
I have imported keyboard module in my code, so how can I Fix this?
That the program would work
