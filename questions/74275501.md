# How Call a Python Websocket from a NFC Scanned on the phone(straight from the phone like with a URL)

Ok, no code here, more trying to get some directions.
I'm working on my home automation using tuya objects. Till now I was able to create a websocket (using python websockets and asyncio) that gets a message and turn on my devices. I created a flask website to configure passwords, keys etc. Now what I'm trying to achieve is using a NFC tag(scanned by my phone) call the websocket sending a message. I bought some NFC tags, got a an android app called NFC Tools to record data into the NFC tag.
Problem is NFC tools doesnt give me too many options I can add text, and URLs but I dont know how to call my websocket from there. Can I call it using its URL like ws://something.go? Can I make the phone not open a browser when I scam the tag? Should I create a page on flask for that and put the page address?
Anyway, I'm kind of lost. Can you guys point me in the right direction?
