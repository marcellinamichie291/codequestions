# How to use right queryset in django?

There are model:
class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    hired_at = models.DateField(auto_now=True)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits = 9, decimal_places= 2)
    boss = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True,blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    has_boss = models.BooleanField(null=True)
    is_visited = models.BooleanField(null=True)


And there are BAD queryset in view:
 def get_queryset(self):
        return reversed(Employee.objects.all())

I want specific query:

It should have all employees Only once for queryset. Now i show in template many employees more than 1 time, especially if some employees have the same boss.
It should consist of from full chain from lowest employee to highest (main boss).
