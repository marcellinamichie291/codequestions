# BigQuery Dynamic JSON parsing with conditions

I have a JSON that looks like this:
{
  "CombinedCon": {
    "IntCon": {
      "Name": "aaa",
      "Value": "10",
      "OperationType": ">=",
      "Source": "bbb"
    },
    "OperationType": "AND",
    "CombinedCon2": {
      "StringCon": {
        "Name": "ccc",
        "Value": "20",
        "OperationType": "=",
        "Source": "bbb"
      },
      "OperationType": "OR",
      "StringCon2": {
        "Name": "ccc",
        "Value": "30",
        "OperationType": "=",
        "Source": "bbb"
      }
    }
  }
}

It's a chain of conditions, each 'Con' represents a condition and some of them are combined, with OperationType stating what is the relations between conditions. This JSON can be as simple or complex as it gets, meaning each chain branch can divide into several leaves with relations between them, and those leaves can also be divided, with conditions that some of them are singles and some combined.
I need to dynamically parse this JSON and create a single string that describes this chain in a more 'readable' way.
For this example:
(aaa >= 10) AND ((ccc = 20) OR (ccc = 30))

There are also other columns involved like the name of the entire chain and the source inside the JSON, so in a final tabular way it should look like this:
