# Openssl Upgrade issue

I installed the new version of openssl 3.0.7 from source code and when I check the version whith openssl version I get this output:
OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022)

The output from the old one is:
OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022)

They both have the same (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022)
Is this normal?
Did I miss something?
