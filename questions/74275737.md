# Survey123 connect form's dropdown values are not visible in experience builder

When connected survey123 form to experience builder, the dropdown values added in surve123 using CSV, are not visible in experience builder.
I added csv in arcgis online and share on organizational level.
The dropdown value directly added in excel form is visible but added through csv is not visible.
