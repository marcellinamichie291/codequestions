# Companion-bubble.js in the console

I've been getting this error lately in my console

companion-bubble.js:1465 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
    at Function.keys (<anonymous>)
    at companion-bubble.js:1465:19726
    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)
    at Ln (companion-bubble.js:1465:19144)


Please, how do I fix it?
