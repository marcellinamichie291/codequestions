# Firebase notification or alert for deletion of a collection

In Firestore, I have seen multiple ways to restrict the deletion of documents with security rules and to prevent the deletion of a collection by using Acess Controls.
But is there a way to get a notification or an alert when a collection is deleted in Firestore?
Deleting a collection is critical and it's surprising that there is no easy way to stay aware of it.
