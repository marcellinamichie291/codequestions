# what does the term "line" mean in the float specs?

I am reading through the CSS float spec but I can't understand what the term "line" refers to or how to visualize it in my mind.

A float is a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line.

does that refer to the "line box" term?, if that were the case, does the float create an inline formattting context?
Can you help me to understand that concept?
Thanks in advance for your answer.
