# Why google rejected the app if all of the terms were met?

The app got rejected recently, and I did not find any policies changes recently, we do constantly updates, and for some reason it got reject now.
Reason provided:
Your offer does not clearly and accurately describe the terms of your trial offer or introductory pricing, including when a free trial will convert to a paid subscription, how much the paid subscription will cost, and how a user can cancel if they do not want to convert to a paid subscription.
However, we do provide the terms for how long the user will get a free trial. Tried to appeal, but they sent the same message. Can you please share what can be added so the app will not be rejected?
