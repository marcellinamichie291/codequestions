# Access to self hosted gitlab instance (normal/not API!) with users SAML kerbos token?

Given there is a selfhosted Gitlab instance in which a SAML login to keycloak is activated.
The SAML login in Keycloak works with Kerberos.
I want to create an app that accesses the Gitlab instance in the name of the user to access functions not provided by the API.
Is there a way to access the Gitlab Page, using Python and the users Kerberos Token?
I am already able to retrieve the Kerberos Token from Keycloak, i.e. to get an OAuth 2.0 access token.
Also when I copy the Cookie information from the Browser into the request.session I am able to access the Gitlab page from my Python app as wanted.
But looking on the requests done within the browser I am currently unable to mimic the browser behaviour within Python.
