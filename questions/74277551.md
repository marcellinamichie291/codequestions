# Perl and JSON data with quotes

I am using this Perl module JSON::XS to convert a Hash to JSON , where i am creating the hash on the fly and converting it to json using the below :
print  encode_json \%hash;

the JSON is converted to something like this :
{
    "info": ["test","test2"],
    "name": "test",
    "uid": "1"
}

is it possible to convert it to something like this :
{
        info: ['test','test2'],
        name: 'test',
        uid: '1'

}

i.e removing the ' from the keys and replacing "" with '' on the values ?any idea how to achieve this?
