# VisibleItemsList to Show with wild card for just YYYY-MM instead of YYYY-MM-DD

Below is the Macro capture i wanted to get data for whole quarter eg. July, August & September
Hence i replace it with wild card as the list is long however i keep encounter error.
ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1").PivotFields( _
        "[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].[Reservation Cancellation Date]" _
        ).VisibleItemsList = Array(
"[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].&[2022-07-**T00:00:00]",
"[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].&[2022-08-**T00:00:00]",
"[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].&[2022-09-**T00:00:00]")

]
i just started on VBA is really looking for some help thanks in advance
expect that instead have to put in "[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].&[2022-07-01T00:00:00]" all the way to "[Reservation Details].[Reservation Cancellation Date].&[2022-07-30T00:00:00]"
