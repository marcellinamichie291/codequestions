# gyp ERR! stack Error: Could not find any Visual Studio installation to use, But I'm using VSCode

I'm using VSCode and:
node v16.13.2
npm 8.15.0
I just build an Angular project and install the dependencies one by one and all goes fine.
While others download my project without 'node_module' folder, and trying to 'npm install' for those dependencies, it has threatened the error from node-gyp that > python is not found.

It's strange since I didn't include anything related to python.
Then I just follow to install the python it says can't find VS or C++ something.

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS You need to install the latest version of Visual Studio

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS including the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS For more information consult the documentation at:

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows

npm ERR! gyp ERR! find VS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then I just stuck at this place.
I finally resolved this issue by skip the scripts: npm install --ignore-scripts
But should it be done for all normal projects? or I should install all those things ... python c++, VS2017 ...?
Please help if you have any ideas, thanks a lot
I'm expect how to process if I just want a normal 'npm install' for a normal project, thanks.
