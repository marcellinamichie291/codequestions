I would like to send data from my Windows computer to my Android Mobile.
For this, I need to activate the Accessory mode of the Android device and the USB Host mode on the Windows device.
On my Windows computer, I have a USB Composite device for the Android Mobile. This Composite USB device bundles several interfaces: Enumeration of USB Composite Devices.
Unfortunately, I can't find information how I can access the single devices of a Composite device.
I want to get a device id / path, which I can open with CreateFile to use the created HANDLE for opening a WinUsb handle with WinUsb_Initialize.
How can I get this device id / path of the single USB devices inside a Composite USB device?
