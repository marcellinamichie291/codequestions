# Bicep - Unable to Create VM Snapshot Backup Policy for Azure Recovery Services Vault

I am trying to deploy a Recovery Services Vault as part of an infrastructure release using Bicep. I am having trouble deploying one backup policy in particular, a VM Snapshot backup policy (AzureIaaSVM).
I have followed the Bicep reference page for creating the template but it fails validation when trying to deploy.
I am using VSCode to develop and when I build an ARM template from the Bicep file, it fails validation with the following message:

If I have understood the documentation correctly, there should be more than just 'AzureStorage' being allowed here.
My question is, is this a tooling/API problem or have I misunderstood the documentation? If so, what would I have to alter to get this working?
The template:
