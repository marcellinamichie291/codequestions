# New cmd tabs from a batch file

I got this batch file that starts up certain things i need often. It starts 4 console apps. It works great however i causes 4 cmd's to pop up.
Its preferable to open tab's in the new default windows 11 cmd window with tabs, but i found no way to do this.
Right now my bat script is doing something like
cd project1
start cmd /c "something"
cd ..

cd project2
start cmd /c "something"
cd ..

I been looking to replace start with something that starts it in the tab of the current cmd window
