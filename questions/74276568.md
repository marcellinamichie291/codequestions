# AWS ECS containers on EC2 are taking different region than the region EC2 is launched in

I have an AWS ECS cluster on EC2. The region of ECS cluster and EC2 is us-west-2. But the task container image on running has AWS_REGION environment variable set to a different region in the task container.
Somehow the ecs task role is setting region as us-east-2.
How to have the same region as ECS cluster and EC2 within the ECS task container as well ?
