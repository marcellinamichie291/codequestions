# How to automatically run lines of code each time I create a new Jupyter Notebook project?

As far as I know, a conda environment provides a specific Python distribution and a specific set of installed packages.
What I am looking for is a configuration of conda or whatever so that each time I am going to open a new Jupyter Notebook project, few lines of code such as
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib notebook
from IPython.display import display, HTML
display(HTML("<style>.container { width:100% !important; }</style>"))
display(HTML("<style>.output_result { max-width:100% !important; }</style>"))
display(HTML("<style>.prompt { display:none !important; }</style>"))

automatically run on my machine. It could make me saving a considerable amount of time. Could you suggest me anything, please?
