# How can I get the correct type if I access an object property with a string in TypeScript?

Say I have the following code:
interface Response { 'property.a': number; 'property.b': string }
const response: Response = {
  'property.a': 10,
  'property.b': 'foo'
}

I want to access the properties of response in a type-safe way, but it doesn't completely work as I would expect. What I am looking for is a way of accessing object properties with strings, where

If the object has the property, accessing it gives the correct type
If the object does not have the property, accessing it throws an error

If you access the properties directly, this is what happens:
response['property.a'] // works as expected: is of type number
response['property.c'] // should throw an error, but doesn't

So condition 1 is satisfied, but condition 2 isn't. I also tried the following:
const get = <T>(obj: T, key: keyof T) => obj[key]
get(response, 'property.a') // should be of type number, but is number | string;
get(response, 'property.c') // works as expected: throws error

So at least throws the error, but now it returns a union of all possible property types in Response- this method fails on condition 1, but satisfies condition 2.
Is there a method that satisfies both conditions?
EDIT:
I just figured out that there is a TypeScript rule called noImplicitAny that enabled this kind of behavior! Unfortunately I can't enable this rule in the codebase I'm currently working in, so I'll keep this question open in case there's another workaround.
