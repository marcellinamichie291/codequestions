# Get a enum uppercase values version derivated from another enum

I have the following enum in TypeScript:
export enum OrderState {
  stateA: "State_A",
  stateB: "State_B"
}

And i would like to generate without create another enum the uppercase version of the same enum:
export enum OrderStateUpper {
  stateA: "STATE_A",
  stateB: "STATE_B"
}

it is possible using advanced types?
I created a derivated type using the following approach, but I would like to derivate in another enum:
export type OrderStateUppercase = Uppercase<CreditOrderState>
