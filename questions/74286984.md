# Linking 3 Flutter Projects in One Flutter Project

There are 3 Flutter Projects with me.

Flutter Project for Business Directory
Flutter project for Job Portal
Flutter project for LMS

I need to link these three flutter projects in one flutter project.

In this image you will see the job portal banner, when user click on the post ad, the Job Portal Project shoudl be visible in the same app.
I need to know the task is possible to do it, if it is possible, how to do it?
