Does Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol give to the following segments more time than it gives to the first segment? I understand that Go-Back-N uses a single timer (with a constant amount of time X) and that this timer is restarted each time a sender receives an ACK for the oldest segment that was sent, but not acknowledged yet.
Does this mean that for a "segment 2", sent almost immediately after the first segment ("segment 1") was sent, GBN gives almost the whole amount of time that was given to the "segment 1" plus the amount of time X, which is a value the timer is set to? (given that immediately before segment 2's ACK was received the timer was restarted because segment 1's ACK was received)
