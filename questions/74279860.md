# How to store in firebase storage a file received from an HTTP request?

I am working on a Nuxt3 app.
On the server api side, I m trying to parse a file received from the client side, to store it in firebase cloud storage.
Here is my api file:
export default defineEventHandler(async event => {
    const form = formidable({ multiples: true });

    form.parse(event.req, async (err, fields, files: formidable.Files) => {

    }
}

I need to transform the content of the files argument (which actually contains one file), either in a Blob, a Uint8Array or an ArrayBuffer.
How can I do that ? I saw some solutions with FileReader API and Blob API but it seems they aren't implemented in NodeJS.
Thanks for help.
