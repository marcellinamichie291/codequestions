# Hard Realtime C++ for Robot Control


I am trying to control a robot using a template-based controller class written in c++. Essentially I have a UDP connection setup with the robot to receive the state of the robot and send new torque commands to the robot. I receive new observations at a higher frequency (say 2000Hz) and my controller takes about 1ms (1000Hz) to calculate new torque commands to send to the robot. The problem I am facing is that I don't want my main code to wait to send the old torque commands while my controller is still calculating new commands to send. From what I understand I can use Ubuntu with RT-Linux kernel, multi-thread the code so that my getTorques() method runs in a different thread, set priorities for the process, and use mutexes and locks to avoid data race between the 2 threads, but I was hoping to learn what the best strategies to write hard-realtime code for such a problem are.
// main.cpp
#include "CONTROLLER.h"
#include "llapi.h"

void main{
    ...
    CONTROLLERclass obj;
    ...
    double new_observation;
    double u;
    ...
    while(communicating){
        get_newObs(new_observation); // Get new state of the robot (2000Hz)
        obj.getTorques(new_observation, u); // Takes about 1ms to calculate new torques
        send_newCommands(u); // Send the new torque commands to the robot
    }
    ...
}

Thanks in advance!
