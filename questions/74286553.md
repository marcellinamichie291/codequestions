# Laravel Sanctum's createToken method tries to insert to wrong table

I'm trying to setup Laravel Sanctum to issue API tokens.
When I do $user->createToken('test');, it fails while attempting to insert the generated token into my tokens table which I had previously created to store third party API tokens.
I was expecting it to insert it into personal_access_tokens instead.
My guess is that somehow this tokens table and Token model interfere with Sanctum. In my User model, I have this method which return a user's third party API tokens:
public function tokens()
{
   return $this->hasMany(Token::class);
}

Any idea why it does that and how to fix it?
