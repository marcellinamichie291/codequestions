In SQLite, if a foreign key refers to multiple tables, how can we create a table and insert values?
I have created it as follows, but when I was trying to insert values, I got the foreign key constraint failed message.
CREATE TABLE ClientPhone
(
    phone   VARCHAR(10),
    clientID    INTEGER,              
    
Primary Key (phone),
Foreign key (clientID) REFERENCES CompanyClient(clientID) on update cascade on delete cascade,
Foreign key (clientID) REFERENCES PersonalClient(clientID) on update cascade on delete cascade 
);


INSERT INTO ClientPhone VALUES(0402563698,101234);
INSERT INTO ClientPhone VALUES(0427841235,102356);
INSERT INTO ClientPhone VALUES(0465123002,107845);
INSERT INTO ClientPhone VALUES(0401258741,109632);
