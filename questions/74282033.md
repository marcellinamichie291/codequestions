# Eclipse - The import javax.jws cannot be resolved

I have imported recently in my code the packages javax.jws.webService and javax.jws.webMethod, the first time i launch my code the import works, but when i came back, this error appeared.
I have java 1.8

I tried to restart Eclipse, but it doesn't work.
