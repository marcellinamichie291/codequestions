# How to get the object returned from a request from the networks tab of google chrome using selenium javascript

I need to dismantle a website that each search page displays 10 cards with the search information
Ex:
Page 1: 10 cards
Page 2: + 10 cards
This information is displayed in the request content in the networks tab and I wanted to get all the content in a scalable way by going through all the pages and getting the body of the request from all the pages
Estou utilizando Selenium Javascript e consigo percorrer cada uma das paginas, só não consigo pegar as informações da aba networks

this picture shows:
Two requests for having two pages traversed and the object with the content of the request that I need to get
