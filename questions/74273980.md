# How to use VS Code key binding for multiple action?

I would like to trigger suggestions in vs code by pressing the left or right key.
{
"key": "left",
"command": "editor.action.triggerSuggest",
"when": "editorTextFocus"
},
It triggers the suggestions but the default behavior of these keys is not working. How to implement such a feature with its native functionality.
