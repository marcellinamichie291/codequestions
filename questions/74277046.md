# Vercel file 404 not found

I am trying to deploy a website made with Vite, React and ThreeJS on Vercel.
On localhost the website works perfectly, but Vercel can't find some files.
const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader, './src/assets/models/scene.gltf');

It gives me this error:
Uncaught Error: Could not load ./src/assets/models/scene.gltf: fetch for "https://websiteurl.vercel.app/src/assets/models/scene.gltf" responded with 404: Not Found)
