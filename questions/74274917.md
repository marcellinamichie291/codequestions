# Is %encoded format allowed for IPv4address format of host of uri in RFC 3968?

I am trying to create a URI library from the RFC 3986 definitions. While validating host there are 3 allowed formats:

IP-literal
IPv4address
Reg-name

Here IPv4address's format is little ambiguous (or I am making a mistake in understanding that). The definition says it can be of the format: dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet and
dec-octet   = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
            / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
            / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
            / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
            / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255

When the definitions says "2" %x30-34 DIGIT does it mean if any of the three digits (0-255 range number) can be represented in percent-encoded format or only some particular digits can be represented in the percent-encoded format.
