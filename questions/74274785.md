# Return list works with from only "Dart"

I have to get list from function()
when i direct return this list i get an error
while when i fill it first with List.from it works fine
and this is an Example
/// This Make an Error "IDE" don't print errors just stop compiling tree
  static List<Event> get eventList => cacheImpl.get('HiveBoxName');


/// This Working Fine
  static List<Event> get eventList2 => List.from(cacheImpl.get('HiveBoxName'));


.
and the get method that i call is

so why it works only with List from ?
