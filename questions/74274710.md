# glibc&musl how to use in android application

I have had some problems recently。
I want to try to use musl or glibc in an Android project, import my project, and thus not use the libc library provided by Android itself, because many attackers will modify the ROM method, which makes me very upset, so I want to use this libc way to confront them. But I introduce musl compilation in the project keeps reporting error.
This problem has bothered me for a long time。
Is there a libc implementation library that can be introduced directly to Android projects? Thanks for your recovery, I can have a cup of coffee if you can.
