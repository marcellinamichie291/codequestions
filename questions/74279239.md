# Table in markdown in Jupyter Notebook is stretched, I want to make it proportional

I want to create this table proportional, the problem is in Jupyter Notebook' markdown the second column is stretched, making the table looks ugly.
This is my table:
| Lake | $V$ (km$^{3} \times 10^{3}$) | r (km$^{3}$/year) |
| -----: | :------ | :------ |
| Superior | 12.2 | 65.2 |
| Michigan | 4.9 | 158 |
| Erie | 0.46 | 175 |
| Ontario | 1.6 | 209 |
