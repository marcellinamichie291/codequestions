# Select max and latest value from table in PostgreSQL

I have a table like this:
value  ts
2      1
3      5
7      3
1      2
5      4

I need to select max value, min value and value with max ts. Is it possible to do it with one query? Is there an aggregate function which returns the first value from table? If so, I could do something like
select max(value), min(value), first(value) from table order by ts desc;

(For this query max value is 7, min value is 1, and value with max ts is 3)
