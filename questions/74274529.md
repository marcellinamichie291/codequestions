# Get most recent value in json dot net core

I'm getting JSON response something like this...
{
    "message": "All Time Score Standing with friends",
    "response": [
        {
            "userId": "123",
            "newId": "321",
            "points": 40
        },
        {
            "userId": "123",
            "newId": "321",
            "points": 60
        },
        {
            "userId": "456",
            "newId": "654",
            "points": 150
        },
        {
            "userId": "456",
            "newId": "654",
            "points": 180
        }
    ]
}

So, What I want is, from this list I just want to extract only one data for the respective user (with the most recent value of points). In conclusion, I want to remove redundancy and want to get single data for every user.
My Expected Result is something like :
{
    "message": "All Time Score Standing with friends",
    "response": [       
        {
            "userId": "123",
            "newId": "321",
            "points": 60
        },
        {
            "userId": "456",
            "newId": "654",
            "points": 180
        }
    ]
}

NOTE : Response is Generic type in c# which I'm passing
