# AST for many programming languages

I need to create an authorization system, to do it I will generate a token containing some permissions but in AST syntax and there will be many client consumers (in different languages JavaScript, Python etc..) to verify that permissions (after transforming the ASTs to code).
So my question us, is there some generic AST syntax for all programming languages ? or a syntax per language ?
