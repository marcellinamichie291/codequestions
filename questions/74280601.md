I do a lot of data cleanup work, and some of that involves removing special characters from excel sheets. However, sometimes those characters are necessary for comprehension of the data, so rather than blanket remove them, I'd like to generate a list I can go through to then find/replace as needed, depending on the cell context. Most of the other answers I've seen are designed to clean these values out, not list them, and I've struggled to adapt the code.
What I see this looking like is that I'd select a custom range in a sheet, run a macro, and this would generate a new sheet with a list of each unique non a-z, 0-9, non-space character. 
Given the example data above, I see this function as returning a sheet with either one cell as ;[|-*{%, or a single row with one value per cell.
I've got a number of macros that work on a selected range, and I thought to instantiate an array that would essentially be all non-alphanumeric values of the first cell, then iterating through the range, adding each value to the array, then displaying all non-unique values in a new sheet. Not sure if this is the best approach, and I was running into nomenclature errors as VBA really doesn't come naturally. Any thoughts?
