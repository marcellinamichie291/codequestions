# Is there a way of scraping only tweet replies from a certain profile using python?

For example only collecting tweets from Elon Musk where he has replied to another person. Currently using snscrape, however this will collect all of his tweets. Would it be possible without using selenium to manually go through the profile?
Thanks in advance for any advice.
