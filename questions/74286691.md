# How do I implement a gRPC IPC?

There is a server application (ASP.NET Core (gRPC service)) and a client application running on another PC (WPF).
One of the functions of the gRPC service is to send screenshots to the client application, but it has to be run as a Windows service, so I can't get screenshots directly from the service to the client application.
Question: how to implement an "agent" application running on a remote computer where the service is, but in a user session to get screenshots through it and then pass them to the client?
As I understand it is possible to do it with the help of IPC, but I can't understand the details of implementation, how can I call from gRPC service to the agent to make a screenshot, return the result (as an array of bytes) to the service and it sends it to the client...
