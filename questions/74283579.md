# Constant as polygon fill in plotly

Is there a simple way to fill polygons with a single color in plotly? The color argument works below but not fill. Or should I trick choropleth with a constant instead of a variable?
library(sf)
library(plotly)
nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)
plot_geo(nc, color = I("red"), fill=I("blue"))
