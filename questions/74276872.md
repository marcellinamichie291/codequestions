            }

                if(mark< score.get(i)) {
                    System.out.println("You got a "+i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    
        catch(InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Input, program terminating");
            
        
    }
}

So I am trying to make a grading system but it isn't working can i have some help please? I am trying to make it so that a mark of 40 is a pass as a third class but i want to use a hashmap to challenge myself as opposed to the switch case.
