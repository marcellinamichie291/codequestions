# Shade area under the curve to one side of crosshair in highcharts/highcharter

I am looking for a way to shade an area to the left of cursor to visually see the proportion of total area under the density curve where x < X, i.e. a visual feel for a cumulative density function. Is there an easy/elegant way to do this in highcharts?
library(highcharter)

df <- data.frame(x = seq(-3, 3, 0.02),
                 pdf = dnorm(seq(-3, 3, 0.02)),
                 cdf = pnorm(seq(-3, 3, 0.02)))

highchart() |>
  hc_add_series(df, "line", hcaes(x, pdf)) |>
  hc_tooltip(
    headerFormat = "",
    pointFormat = "{point.cdf}"
    ) |>
  hc_xAxis(crosshair = T)
