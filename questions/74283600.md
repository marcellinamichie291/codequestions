# Select rows where jsonb field in a provided list

Say I have table in Postgres with column data of type JSONB. This column, ortholog, contains entries that look like:
{
    "9823": ["ENSSSCG00000004001"], 
    "10090": ["ENSMUSG00000022347"], 
    "10116": ["ENSRNOG00000004692"]
}

I am trying to retrieve all entries with "10090" whose any member belongs to a list of ENSMUSG ids, such as ENSMUSG00000022347, ENSMUSG00000022348, etc.
Is there a way to make a query like this?
SELECT uuid, data ->> '10090' 
FROM "ortholog" 
WHERE data ->> '10090' INTERSECTS WITH ('ENSMUSG00000022347', 'ENSMUSG00000022348', 'ENSMUSG0000009422');
