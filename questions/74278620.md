# Is there a way to make "Find All" run dynamic searches in Visual Studio?

For example I want to find all classes that contain the method tag "[Test]" but lack the class tag "[TestFixture]".
I know a simple Google search can do things like...
'bass -fish'  Will return bass guitars etc. with the bass fish stuff excluded.
I'd guess I want something like '[Test] AND ![TestFixture]'
Of course the search treats that like a single string and finds nothing.
Any ideas? :)
Thanks in advance!
