# How to switch Orientation on PC platform like on mobile platform

Unity Version:2021.2  PC:window10
I designed a scene 1080*1920, which is usually used in portrait displays, as shown below

Now I want to display it on a landscape 1920*1080 PC, as shown below
I want to get the same effect as the mobile platform.What should I do? The premise is that I can't modify the UI already done.  How can I achieve this on the Pc platform?
I try Change CanvasScale but uselese.its easy on IOS or Android
