# How do I predict the value based on the curve?

I have two matrices (100,6). one of them contains PSNR values for different bitrates and the other one contains corresponding bitrates. if I plot the diagram of one row, we will have the following diagram based on the following data.
660256  1522800 2481600 3533650 4432290 5469300
38.3587 41.0925 42.3772 43.4243 44.1588 45.0317


based on the following data for bitrate 660256 we have a PSNR value of 38.3587. my question is if I have bitrate 1000000, what will be the corresponding PSNR? I have to do this for all other columns too.do I need to use curve fitting?
