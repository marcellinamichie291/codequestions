# Use keys of one type to create type containing keys of another type

I have an interface of types as such:
interface MyInterface {
  Name1: { userId: string }
  Name2: { bookingId: string }
}

I have a type below that accepts an object of type { [key: keyof MyInterface]: boolean }:
type TProperties<T extends Record<keyof MyInterface, boolean>> = {
    [P in keyof T]: P extends keyof MyInterface ? Pick<MyInterface, P> : never
}

But when I try using it as such:
TProperties<{ Name1: true }> // Error <large obj redacted> is not assignable to type 'Record<keyof MyInterface, boolean>'.

Where am I going wrong in the above?
