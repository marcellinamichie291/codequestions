# How to localize Libgdx app name for iOS and RoboVM?

My LibGDX project runs on Android and iOS. The Android app name is specified in the manifest:
<application
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    ...

So, it takes the app name from the android strings.xml file. How can I achieve same behaviour with RoboVM and iOS? I would like to localize the app name later. Therefore it should take the same app name from the Android strings.xml file too.
My robovm.properties file:
app.version=1.0
app.id=com.mycom.myapp
app.mainclass=com.mycomp.myapp.IOSLauncher
app.executable=IOSLauncher
app.build=1
app.name=My App Name

My robovm.xml file:
<config>
<executableName>${app.executable}</executableName>
...
