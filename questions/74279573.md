# Laravel - check if entry with a certain string already exists in database

I have something like a form, and I want to prevent people from submitting the form or better to say, the Laravel API from saving the data into the database. People have to link their social media to this form, and it is stored as json {"id":"b3931aba-a58e-4f0f-a4fa-4afda75035cd","value":"testusername"}. And if somebody already submitted the form with a certain social media name, I want my api to check if there is an entry that contains an entry with the value testusername, and if so, then throw an error that the person already submitted them form, but my code does not work - it responds Couldn't connect to server (though when I remove the check in the controller it works fine).
That is the code in my Controller
$requestPerson = $request->all();

if(Person::alreadySubmit($request->id, $requestPerson['personInteraction']['socialMedia'])) {
    return $this->badRequestResponder->validationError(['message' => 'Person has already submitted for the given username!']);
}

and then I have my Person models file with the method
 public static function alreadySubmit($formId, $socialMedia)
    {
        return self::where([['form_id', '=', $formId], ['socialMedia', 'like', $socialMedia]])->exists();
    }
