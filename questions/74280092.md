# TIme the period between two actions on separate pages

Sorry if this is not the right place to ask this question but after doing some search on the board seems like this might be the place to ask it.
I have 2 pages. On page-a.php a user clicks a button, which creates page-2.php and after completing some tasks on that second page the user click "Submit" button, at which point I would like to turn off the timer. I would like to record that time using Google Analytics which I think I can do with something like that:
// Feature detects Navigation Timing API support.
if (window.performance) {
    // Gets the number of milliseconds since page load
    // (and rounds the result since the value must be an integer).
    var timeSincePageLoad = Math.round(performance.now());

    // Sends the timing event to Google Analytics.
    gtag('event', 'timing_complete', {
    'name': 'load',
    'value': timeSincePageLoad,
    'event_category': 'JS Dependencies'
  });
}

The question is how do I start that timer and keep it across pages?
