# Regex to extract text between two character patterns

I have multiple rows of data that look like the following:
dgov-nonprod-adp-personal.groups
dgov-prod-gcp-sensitive.groups
I want to get the text between the last hyphen and before the period so:
personal
sensitive
I have this regex (?:prod-(.*)-)(.*).groups however it gives two groups and in bigquery I can only extract if there is one group, what would the regex be to just extract the text i want?
Note: after the second hyphen and before the third it will always be prod or nonprod, that's why in my original regex i use prod- since that will be a constant
