# Detected use of different schedulers when testing with coroutines

I have a class that takes a coroutine dispatcher as a parameter that I am trying to test. In my tests I use @Before to setup my class before each test is run
@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)
@Before
fun setup() = runTest {
    .....
    val dispatcher = StandardTestDispatcher(testScheduler)
    scheduleService = ScheduleService(dispatcher)
}

I have a test that I am trying to run that has a SharedFlow that I want to check the value of so I also use runTest with that test
@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)
@Test
fun testFullScheduleCreation() = runTest{
    ......
    val data = scheduleService.scheduleChangedListener.first()
}

When I try to run the test I get an error

Detected use of different schedulers. If you need to use several test
coroutine dispatchers, create one TestCoroutineScheduler and pass it
to each of them.

The error is because of my use of @Before but I am not sure how to fix the error without copying all code in that setup method to each test
