# Using php_com_dotnet.dll on Apache linux

Hi I'm trying to convert an existing windows based php project to a Docker container running php:7.4-apache. I was able to get all extensions installed besides php_com_dotnet.dll and when I load my website I get an error of
Uncaught Exception: Class 'COM' not found File: /var/www/html/lib/DWC-ADO.inc, Line: 0.
Is there a way to get php_com_dotnet.dll running on linux?
