# FilterID over multiple rows

What I'm trying to do is find the UserIDs of Users that follow the following criteria:

They appear twice in the data (same UserID), so they have 2 cases. (CaseID should be different but let's not take that into account).
Both cases have the same DeviceID.
The first case chronologically has a blank orderID (doesn't have an order) and the second one does have an orderID BUT the date difference shouldn't be more than a week between the two.

*Note that it is possible for a user to have more than 2 cases and if any pair of them passes the above criteria, the UserID should be counted.
