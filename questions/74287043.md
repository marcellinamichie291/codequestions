# Cypress testing Xero Authentication process

I'm attempting to test the Xero Authentication process with Cypress, but I am encountering this error after I login with my correct login details.
Xero Auth Error -

Is there a way to fix this or is there an alternative someone can suggest?
Thank you and have a nice day!
Tried: Connecting to Xero through Cypress
Expecting: Successful Authentication.
