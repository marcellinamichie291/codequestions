# Unity Advertisment with Meditation not Showing Test Ads

I just upgrade advertisement package to Advertisement with Meditation package. I used sample project scripts. In unity editor everything is OK but when i build on physical android test device i'm getting this log:
"Initialization Failed: Unknown:Some services couldn't be initialized. Look at inner exceptions to get more information."
and test ads are not showing on android device.
I couldn't figure out what it means. I did a google search but couldn't find any results.
I've already enabled test mode in editor: Services->Ads->Test mode enable

My unity version: 2019.4.16f1
Adversitement with Meditation verison:
1.0.4
