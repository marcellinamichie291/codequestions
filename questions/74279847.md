# XCode test is unable to tap on camera permission switch

I am writing a XCUITest that previously deny camera permission to the app and after the test is going to setting and taps on the camera permission switch. The test is unable to tap on the camera switch.
Has someone experience this issue with XCode 14 / iOS 16?
The test is unable to find the switch. I was able to find the button using the record button and tapping on the camera switch. When I run the test it fails because it cannot find the button.
