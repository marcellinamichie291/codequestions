# Flutter: Why do I get an error when using the setState() method?

I added setState() method and got an error. Terminal error (I'm using flutter run -d chrome --web-hostname localhost --web-port 7357 command, so it's in terminal):
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building StreamBuilder<List<BusinessModel>>(dirty, state:
_StreamBuilderBaseState<List<BusinessModel>, AsyncSnapshot<List<BusinessModel>>>#918d6):
setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build.
This BusinessList widget cannot be marked as needing to build because the framework is already in
the process of building widgets. A widget can be marked as needing to be built during the build
phase only if one of its ancestors is currently building. This exception is allowed because the
framework builds parent widgets before children, which means a dirty descendant will always be
built. Otherwise, the framework might not visit this widget during this build phase.
The widget on which setState() or markNeedsBuild() was called was:
  BusinessList
The widget which was currently being built when the offending call was made was:
  StreamBuilder<List<BusinessModel>>

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  StreamBuilder<List<BusinessModel>>
  StreamBuilder:file:///Users/name/development/projects/flutter/project-id/lib/screens/tabs/a_tab_screen.dart:52:
  12

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:

My code:
StreamBuilder<List<Model>>(
  stream: db.stream(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return …;
    }

    final List<Model>? data = snapshot.data;

    if (data != null) {
      for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        if (data[i].aboutLastUpdated.toDate().month == Timestamp.now().toDate().month) {
          setState(() {
            final_data.add(data[i]);
          });
        }
      }

    return …;
  },
);
