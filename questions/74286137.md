# Jenkins script file using double quotes

I am using jenkinsfile in which i want to run a command as a script. Below is the command which i want to use foe getting the asg with particular tags.
But i am not able to use quotes in the script.
existing_asg = sh (script: "aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --query "AutoScalingGroups[? Tags[? (Key=='application_name') && Value=='kunal']]".AutoScalingGroupName --output text")
echo "existing_asg: ${existing_asg}"
When running i am not getting any output. I guess its not able to take inner quotes. Can anyone please help me out
