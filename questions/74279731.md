# How to get count of sessions within a 3-Day window by user (SQL)?

I have built a 3D retention flag which tells me if a user returned to the app within 3 days or not, but this is a boolean flag. Now I want to get how many times the user returned within 3D and wanted to see how I could get there most efficiently?
This is my code so far which returned only a boolean but I want the count. Any help is appreciated!
SELECT 
  date, 
  user_id,
  CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, date, LEAD(date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date)) <= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS retention_3d
FROM mytable
ORDER BY user_id, date
