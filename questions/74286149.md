# Is there a better way to access variables from one React component to another than just passing it through as parameters?

Let's say I have a React component somewhat like this:
function App() {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const [someValue, setSomeValue] = useState("xyz");
  const var1 = "abc";
  const var2 = "def";

  function StepZero() {
    return <div>
       <p>{someValue}</p>
       <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" />
       <h1>{var1} {var2}</h1>
       <Button onClick={() => setSomeValue("123")}>Click</Button>
     </div>;
  }
  
  function StepOne() {
    return <div>
      <h1>{someValue}</h1>
      <Button onClick={() => setSomeValue("456")}>Click</Button>
      <h2>{var1}</h2>
      <h3>{var2}</h3>
    </div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
        {step === 0 ? (
          <StepZero />
        ) : (
          <StepOne />
        )}
    </div>
  );
}

What happens here is, once someValue gets set, the whole StepZero gets re-rendered and the input lost. Really any user interaction gets reset, e.g. an accordion that got opened.
What resolves this is putting StepZero and StepOne directly into the return function, or putting them outside the App component and then passing all the variables in the params like:
{ var1, var2, someValue, setSomeValue }

Is there a better way to do this that I can separate the two steps into components while still being able to access the states and variables/constants, without state changes re-rendering the components every time, or without having to pass all the required variables as parameters?
Note this example app isn't meant to do anything functionally useful
