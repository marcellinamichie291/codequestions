# Fetch live sports data that changes from website to Google sheets

I have a pretty difficult question.
I want to fetch live data from a basketball game website. However, this is very tricky, because first of all:
The live games change all the time, and I'm only interested when one team is playing: "BC Copenhagen". (However, if I get more data from different teams, that would work as well)
When you click on the list, you get moved to a detailed screen about the live game. And this is the data I'm interested in.
So I need to somehow get data from the live games. Is it even possible to do this with Excell commands, or do I need to work with APIs like Zapier or Make? However, I have no idea how to do this.
Do you maybe have to give the Link to the game every time the game starts? But this would really not be a reliable solution.
Note: I'm using this data for a Glide App
