# How can I interpret an HTTPS with non-utf8 characters?

I'm working on a very simple and straightforward reverse proxy in rust without any external libraries. I'm come to my first roadblock. I've noticed that when I try to parse an https request into utf8 it fails. I printed the request as a lossy string. Here is the output:
�f�^���;�r�;�d��N7# ^�8Đ�6 �m�xpPk�
����B]���Fi��֚*G]"�+�/̨̩�,�0�
�       ����/5�rus

I was thinking this has something to do with ssl because on the client side, it says something along the lines of "Secure Connection has Failed". I've looked into decoding ssl requests or whatever this is and have found nothing useful. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
I have tried parsing the request using several different solution from other platforms. They consisted of relying on base64 and other ssl related crates meant for decoding text.
For more context, below is a general example for how I go about getting the output from above:
use std::{
    io::{Read, Result},
    net::TcpListener,
};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let server = TcpListener::bind("localhost:80")?;

    for mut stream in server.incoming().filter_map(Result::ok) {
        let mut buf = [0; 256];
        let bytes = stream.read(&mut buf)?;

        let utf8_lossy = String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf); //  this contains the non-utf8 wumbo jumbo
        let utf8 = String::from_utf8(buf.to_vec()).unwrap(); //  this fails
    }
    Ok(())
}
