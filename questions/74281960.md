# Can't get the balance or USDT TRC20 wallet

I'm trying to obtain the balance of USDT wallet in TRON:
curl --location --request POST 'https://trx.getblock.io/mainnet/fullnode/jsonrpc' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <......>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "eth_call",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0x41a614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c",
            "data": "0x70a082310000000000000000000000004179309abcff2cf531070ca9222a1f72c4a5136874"
        }, "latest"],
        "id":"654654"
    }'

wherein
0x41a614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c is a HEX address of TRON USDT smart contract
and 4179309abcff2cf531070ca9222a1f72c4a5136874 is a hex address of a random wallet
This will always return 0
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"654654","result":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}

I've tried other random USDT addresses as well, and the result has been similar.
Am I the one who's doing something wrong or is it, likely, getblock.io is returning incorrect data?
