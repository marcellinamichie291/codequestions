# the class use in python

Consider the following class:
class Student():
    def __init__(self, student_number, name, grade):
        """Initialise Student object with a given ID number, name and grade, where
           grade is a string, such as 'C', 'B+', 'A+' etc."""
        self.student_number = student_number
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade

    def __repr__(self):
        """The string representation of self, used by Python when printing lists
           of students. [You don't need to understand this.]
        """
        return f"{self.student_number} {self.name}"

Write a function grade_dictionary(students) that takes a list of students as a parameter and returns a dictionary that maps from grade to a list of students (i.e. objects of type Student) who obtained that grade, in the same order as in the students list.
You are required to submit just your grade_dictionary() function into the answer box; the Student class will be supplied automatically so you cannot customise it.

Here is my code about this question:
def grade_dictionary(students):
    """returns a dictionary that maps from grade to a list of students"""
    this_dict={}
    for i in range(0,len(students)):
        student_grade=students[i].grade
        key=this_dict.keys()
        if student_grade not in key :
            value=[f'{students[i].student_number} {students[i].name}']
            this_dict.update({student_grade:value})
        else:
            value=this_dict.get(student_grade)
            value.append(f'{students[i].student_number} {students[i].name}')
            this_dict.update({student_grade:value})
    
    return this_dict


There is a little difference between my answer and the expected results. The expected result doesn't have the single quote, and I don't know how to change the code to meet this.
Please help me, thank you.
