# how to get a value that has exactly the name of the class web scraping

I have this web page:
https://tr.uspoloassn.com/erkek-beyaz-polo-yaka-t-shirt-basic-50249146-vr013/
that contains this html:

this code has the sizes in it. you can see that some class has: js-variant and some has js-variant disabled
what i want is to select the text where the class is js-variant using web scraping.
I tried doing:  response.css('a.js-variant ::text').extract()

but this does not work properly and gives all the values even the ones that has a class disabled in it.
how can I do that?
