# Pandas: parse .csv string type number with dot as thousand separator to int instead of float

It's a .csv with items and prices. The latter already comes rounded (without decimal) but if the price is more than 999, then I've got to deal with the thousand separator.
item, price
foo, 12
bar,678
baz, 1.200


`df.dtype` returns:
item         object
price       float64

If I try to convert to int it truncates the number. So instead of 1.200 (one thousand two hundred) I get 1 (one)
Ps: I winded up deleting the dots with regex, but there has to be a proper way to handle this situation.
