# How to force a line break from string content?

I'm loading data for a page dynamically depending on the data I get from my backend , My code looks like this :
 return (
    <p className="font-mukta tracking-0.165 text-center lg:text-start text-32px md:text-44px xl:text-6xl font-medium pb-2 md:pb-0 xl:leading-snug">
          {title}
        </p>

if my title for example is: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and I want to add a line break after a certain word in that text , for example a line break after the word simply but it's dynamic ,Is there anyway I can force a  line break from the string itself for example by adding the html tag <br> or /n in the actual string but that doesn't really work , Any tips ?
