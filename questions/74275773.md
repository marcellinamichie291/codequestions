# Customer's can't purchase our apple subscription because they use a federated Apple ID

We are new to this federated Apple ID. We have a Apple subscription application in App store and we have problem with users who use federated Apple IDs. Other normal users use our application without problem. We did more research and understood that this federated Apple ID's used under an organization where they will share the application within themselves (Under a network). We had a hard time to find a solution for this.
What is the workaround to make a federated Apple ID account to do a successful purchase? We are searching for a solution almost a week now. Advance Thanks.
Additional information:- The subscription we are talking about is yearly subscription.
We tried exploring federated Apple IDs and understood that it's used under a organization and they can share the application themselves. So we are not sure what is this affecting a successful purchase?
