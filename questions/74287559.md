# How can I diagnose memory leaks in .NET Core 2.2?

I am unable to find a way to diagnose memory leaks for .NET Core 2.2 service which I am using as a backend service.
I am unable to use memory profiling tools like dotTrace, dotMemory and dotnet-counters.
I have also tried using dotnet-gcdump but for some reason the process is not listed when I run
dotnet-gcdump ps
