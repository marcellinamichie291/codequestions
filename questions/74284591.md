# Search higher in array

I have price combinations which are arrays of objects. And I have traveler ages which are an array of numbers. So price combinations have fields like min age and max age and I want to filter travelers ages higher or lower than min age or max age. am stuck on this really don't know how to do it.
  const travelerAges = [5, 10, 35, 50]

  priceCombinations.filter((priceCombination) => {
    if (priceCombination.minAge > travelerAges && priceCombination.maxAge > travelerAges) {
      return false
    } else if (priceCombination.maxAge < travelerAges) {
      return false
    }
    return true
  })

Getting error on IF.

Operator '>' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'number[]'

Any ideas on how can I do this operation?
