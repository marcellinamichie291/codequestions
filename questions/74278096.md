# Map returns [Array(3)] instead of proper Array

In my app, I need an array of diagnosis codes in the form of
['Z57.1', 'Z74.3', 'M51.2'] so I can have access to each of them.
However, when mapping through diagnosis codes, I get [Array(3)] in the console instead of ['Z57.1', 'Z74.3', 'M51.2'], meaning I can't get access to the codes.
How do you map through patient.entries to return ['Z57.1', 'Z74.3', 'M51.2'] in the console instead of [Array(3)]?
 const patient =  {
          id: 'd2773598-f723-11e9-8f0b-362b9e155667',
          name: 'Martin Riggs',
          dateOfBirth: '1979-01-30',
          ssn: '300179-777A',
          gender: Gender.male,
          occupation: 'Cop',
          entries: [
            {
              id: 'fcd59fa6-c4b4-4fec-ac4d-df4fe1f85f62',
              date: '2019-08-05',
              type: 'OccupationalHealthcare',
              specialist: 'MD House',
              employerName: 'HyPD',
              diagnosisCodes: ['Z57.1', 'Z74.3', 'M51.2'],
              description:
                'Patient mistakenly found himself in a nuclear plant waste site without protection gear. Very minor radiation poisoning. ',
              sickLeave: {
                startDate: '2019-08-05',
                endDate: '2019-08-28',
              },
            },
          ],
        },
const codes = patient?.entries.map(c => c.diagnosisCodes);

const codes returns:
[Array(3)]
0
: 
(3) ['Z57.1', 'Z74.3', 'M51.2']
length
: 
1
[[Prototype]]
: 
Array(0)
