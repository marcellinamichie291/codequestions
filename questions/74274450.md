Clock, notification, lock screen, etc. on my phone. I want to customize the fields. I don't know what permissions I need for this and what I need to pay attention to as I will be working on the system. How can I customize my Android Phone?
I've looked through the official documentation, but I couldn't understand the instructions because I don't have any prior experience.
