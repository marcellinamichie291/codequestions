# How to implement Facebook Login & Graph API with python script?

I don't know yet, if its legal/allowed to scrape Instagram user public data.
I need to create a scraper script in python, which will interact with instagram (facebook) graph api endpoints, to fetch instagram public users data.
Is there any method on how to use Facebook Login with python, equivalent of JavaScript SDK (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web).
