# importing tensorflow results in an API version error after installing sklearn in the same conda environment

I've installed tensorflow using miniconda and everything worked until I've installed sklearn package on the same enviroment. I've removed sklearn and tried to upgrade numpy but it didn't solve the issue. tensorflow version is 2.10 numpy version is 1.23, numpy_base version is 1.21. the laptop is base m2 macbook air.
