# Powershell: print command before execuring it

I would like to print a command in Powershell before executing it (for debug purposes).
The command is a python command with some variables.
A simple example:
> $var = "chocolate"
> python test.py hello $var
Argument list: ['test.py', 'hello', 'chocolate']

I would like to print the command with the content of the variable before running it. So print something like:
python test.py hello chocolate

I tried using Set-PSDebug cmdlet but it doesn't resolve the $var variable:
> $var="chocolate"
> Set-PSDebug -trace 1
> python test.py hello $var
    1+ >>>>> python test.py hello $var
Argument list: ['test.py', 'hello', 'chocolate']

(I also tried with -trace 2, not successful either)
Is there a way to print the command with the variable in it before executing it?
Thanks
