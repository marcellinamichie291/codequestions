# How to sync 2 audio files having silence inside, with Python


Tracks #1-2 have the same content (speech), but different speed (tempo); and A,B in #2 are shorter.
I want to paste any silence (A,B) >2s  from #1 to #2
Is there a way to do this in Python? Perhaps using some audio libraries?
I can change manually the speed of #2, and add the silence (eg. Audacity), but I need a program to scan, and paste the silence on its own.
I've seen other topics but my task is different. Many thanks
