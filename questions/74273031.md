# Why does the static dot graph definition not working in newer versions of Jaseci?

I'm using jaseci - 1.3.5.13 version. I'm trying to execute following code snippet to define a static graph;
graph test_graph {
    has anchor graph_root;
    graph G {
        graph_root [node=test_node, name=root]
        node_1 [node=test_node, name=node_1]
        node_2 [node=test_node, name=node_2]
        graph_root -> node_1 [edge=special]
        graph_root -> node_2
        }
    }

I got encountered syntax error in all of these code lines. Is there anything missing here?
