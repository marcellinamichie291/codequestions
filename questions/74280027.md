# os.listdir() only finds a file the first time when the kernel is restarted and fails afterwards

I have this weird issue where I am using os.listdir(path) to list every file in a directory:
files = [os.listdir(path)]
for f in files:
  print(f)

when I do so the first time it returns files a,b,c,d; but when I try to rerun my code, it only returns files b,c,d and cannot find a? For reference, a is a .xlsx file.
Is there any reason why this could be happening?
