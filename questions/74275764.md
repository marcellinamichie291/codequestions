# Double linked list C programming

I'm trying to create a double linked list with strings. The problem is that when I send a word and try to print it out - only the first letter (the ASCII value) comes out. For example if I write "Joe" I will get 74 back (74 is the ASCII value of "J")
I do remember something to do with strncopy but can't recall. Any suggestions? :)
{
    char e;
    Position previous;
    Position next;
};
 
void Insert(char x, List l, Position p)
{
    Position TmpCell;
    TmpCell = (struct Item*) malloc(sizeof(struct Item));
    if(TmpCell == NULL)
        printf("Memory out of space\n");
    else
    {
        TmpCell->e = x;
        TmpCell->previous = p;
        TmpCell->next = p->next;
        p->next = TmpCell;
    }
}```




This is the method used to display: 

```void Display(List l)
{

    printf("The list element are :: ");
    Position p = l->next;
    while(p != NULL)
    {
        printf("%d -> ", p->e);
        p = p->next;
    }
}```



Faults - it just didnt work as expected
