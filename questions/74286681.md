# scanf() leaves the newline character in the buffer

I have the following program:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int a, b;
    char c1, c2;
    printf("Enter something: ");
    scanf("%d", &a); // line 1
    printf("Enter other something: ");
    scanf("%d", &b); // line 2

    printf("Enter a char: ");
    scanf("%c", &c1); // line 3
    printf("Enter another char: ");
    scanf("%c", &c2); // line 4

    printf("Done"); // line 5

    system("PAUSE");

    return 0;
}

As I read in the C book, the author says that scanf() left a newline character in the buffer, therefore, the program does not stop at line 4 for user to enter the data, rather it stores the new line character in c2 and moves to line 5.
Is that right?
However, does this only happen with char data types? Because I did not see this problem with int data types as in line 1, 2, 3. Is it right?
