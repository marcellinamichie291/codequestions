# R GGplot2 Boxplot - How to colour jitter points according to a different variable from the boxes?

I have a table with this kind of data for vehicles (with more rows).
**

So far I got a boxplot using car segments as categories and pricing for the Y-axis, however I added the points with geom_jitter but like to colour them according to the region, so getting two colours for either Europe or China.
As of now, the points have the same colour as the boxes and I am not sure about how to input the "region" category colour.
Here's the code I used so far
Boxplot_data%>%
  ggplot(aes(Segment, Price, colour=Segment))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter( alpha=0.5 )

I tried using a few different ways to obtain the coloured points according to the Region category, but none worked.
