# Problem with reading char variables in struct

i'm, tried to read some count of char type variables from struct by using gets_s in Visual Studio, but it's don't work for me. Then i'm write the same code on Turbo C++, but by gets_s use gets and it work... how i can write it in common C++, not turbo with using gets_s? I'm also tried to use fgets, but after that:
    fgets((Book+i)->name,50,stdin);
    std::cout<<"Write "<<(Book+i)->name<<" author: ";
Write dasd
author: 

i't start to write from new line.
#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<cstdio>

int main(void)
{
    int N;
    std::cout<<"Write count of book's: ";
    std::cin>>N;
    std::cin.ignore(); 

    struct Books
    {
        char name[50];
        char author[50];
        char publisher[50];
        int Y_post;
    }
    *Book = new Books [N];

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        std::cout<<"Write name of book number "<<i+1<<": ";
        gets_s( (Book+i)->name);
        std::cout<<"Write "<<(Book+i)->name<<" author: ";
        gets_s( (Book+i)->author);
        std::cout<<"Write publisher of "<<Book[i].name<<": ";
        gets_s( (Book+i)->publisher);
        std::cout<<"Write year of publishing for "<<Book[i].name<<": ";
        std::cin>>Book[i].Y_post;
        system("cls");
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < N;i++)
    {
        std::cout<<"Name of book number "<<i+1<<": ";
        std::cout<<Book[i].name<<";\n";
    }
    
    _getch();
}
