# docker-compose up error: exec: "air": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

I want to run air live-reloading tool on a Docker container.
These are the config and docker files:
Dockerfile:
# BASE IMAGE
FROM golang:1.19-alpine AS base

WORKDIR /app

ENV GO111MODULE="on"
ENV GOOS="linux"

RUN go mod download && go mod verify


# DEVELOPMENT IMAGE

WORKDIR /app

RUN go get -u github.com/cosmtrek/air

EXPOSE 5000
EXPOSE 2345

ENTRYPOINT ["air", "-c", ".air.conf"]


# BUILDER IMAGE

WORKDIR /app

RUN go build -o myapp


# PRODUCTION IMAGE

COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /usr/local/bin/myapp

EXPOSE 5000

docker-compose:

    networks:

.air.toml:
# .air.toml
# Config file for [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) in TOML format

# Working directory
# . or absolute path, please note that the directories following must be under root.
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
# Just plain old shell command. You could use `make` as well.
cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
# Binary file yields from `cmd`.
bin = "tmp/main"
# Customize binary.
full_bin = "APP_ENV=dev APP_USER=air ./tmp/main"
# Watch these filename extensions.
include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
# Ignore these filename extensions or directories.
exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor", "frontend/node_modules"]
# Watch these directories if you specified.
include_dir = []
# Exclude files.
exclude_file = []
# It's not necessary to trigger build each time file changes if it's too frequent.
delay = 1000 # ms
# Stop to run old binary when build errors occur.
stop_on_error = true
# This log file places in your tmp_dir.
log = "air_errors.log"

[log]
# Show log time
time = false

[color]
# Customize each part's color. If no color found, use the raw app log.
main = "magenta"
watcher = "cyan"
build = "yellow"
runner = "green"

[misc]
# Delete tmp directory on exit
clean_on_exit = true

And with these files when I run docker-compose up I get this error message:
ERROR: for myapp-web  Cannot start service myapp-web: failed to create shim: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: "air": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.

What could be the issue here?
