# What does <A-1> and <Cmd> mean in VIM?

I'm trying to switch to vim and I'm having some difficulty trying to understand what these remaps mean.
I'm using this tab plugin from https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim.
In the read me file they have something to bounce from tabs with the commands as the following:
nnoremap <silent>    <A-1> <Cmd>BufferGoto 1<CR>
nnoremap <silent>    <A-2> <Cmd>BufferGoto 2<CR>

Can anyone enlighten me and future viewers of this thread, what these commands are and what they mean?
Thank you.
