# ADB2C Login URL Access Issue

My website is integrated with ADB2C service, While accessing (“b2ctenant.b2clogin.com”) from Safari browser getting an error as “Your connection is not private”, and it says as safari warns you when a a website uses TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1, which are not secure. Any suggestions to handle this error ?
But While accessing the same b2c login url from other browser it’s working fine.
