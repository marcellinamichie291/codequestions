# Internal Server Error for Quirks mode in Cpanel

In my cpanel I create a html file and add a simple html code. But it shows Internal Server Error and in console it says "This page is in Quirks Mode. Page layout may be impacted. For Standards Mode use <!DOCTYPE html>." Here is my code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is test page</p>
</body>
</html>

I am using Standards Mode of HTML. But it doesn't work.
