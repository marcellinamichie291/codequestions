# Using 'check_fn' parameter in Airflow S3KeySensor to get specific files by LastModified hour

I have a specific problem where files arrive in my S3 bucket at different times of the hour (more than once daily) but the LastModified metadata for each file for that particular time is the same everyday.
For example file may arrive at 21:00hrs and 19:00hrs UTC (these times may change) but the LastModified hour is always 17:00 hours and 20:00 hrs.
Since the arrival time is stamped on the name of the file it keeps changing and hence there is no particular wildcard pattern using which I can have an exact match for any of the file.
I only want to get the files whose LastModified hour matched the hour during which the code is scheduled and gets kicked off
I have been trying to use the check_fn parameter of S3KeySensor to achieve this by getting the file using the LastModified time. The code kicks off at a scheduled time.
def check_fn(files: List) -> bool:
    return (f.get('LastModified).hour == datetime.now().hour for f in files) 

I was expecting this function will only return the files which match the criteria of LastModified hour.
However the code doesn't seem to work the way expected and I am getting wrong files after the poking ends.
Any help regarding this is highly appreciable.
