# I want to populate the column of a dataframe with values from the column of another dataframe when the values of two columns match

I want to populate values of df2['VALUE'] in a new column in df1 df1['New'] when category and location match for both dataframes.
When
df1['category'] = df2['CATEGORY']  AND df1['location'] = df2['LOCATION']
populate values of df2['VALUE'] into a new row in df1 so that using df1['v1'] I can calculate df1['calculatedfield'] = df1['v1']/df1['new']
df1

df1 has more rows than df2, that is why I didn't go with joining the two dataframes. I need to populate df2['new'] with the values from df2['VALUE'] wherever the combination of category and location come up and regardless of the value of df2['type']. I can't drop rows.
I tried
df1['New'] = np.where((df1['category'] == df2['CATEGORY']) & (df1['location'] == df2['location']), df2['VALUE'], None)

and this came up:
ValueError: Can only compare identically-labeled Series objects
