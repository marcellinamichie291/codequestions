# Change color and names of terminals in VScode with a script

I'm a big fan of personalizing my terminals in vscode, I like having them set up like this:

The problem with this, however, is that I often need to restart my vscode instance, or log out from ssh etc.
When I do that, my terminals reset.
Is there some way for me to open new terminals through a script?
i.e. something like this, so that I could write a script for it.
code --terminal --color=blue --name=docker --command=docker exec -it 7935b bash
