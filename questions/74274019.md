# How to track custom events with GA4 which is set up in Google Tag Manager?

I currently have set up Google Tag Manager on my website via https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web. So the GTM snippet is in the head of the website.
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

Now I want to integrate GA4 into the website but it seems the recommended way to do this is via GTM because you do not need hardcoded G-XXXXXX ids anymore.
So adding the following snippet would be unnecessary right? Taken from
https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/events?client_type=gtag
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXX');
</script>

And sending custom events to GA4 and this is done via
gtag('event', '<event_name>', {
  <event_parameters>
})

But how would I send an event to my G-XXXXX id using GTM? Since I do not have a hardcoded G-XXXXX id anymore, how does GTM know how to link the event to my G-XXXXX id? In the GA4 snippet there is extra code to set up the id after declaring the gtag function but after that is just a datalayer.push.
Is GTM setup enough/the equivalent for the standalone GA4 setup?
