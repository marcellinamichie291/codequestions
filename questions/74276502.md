# Why can't I return a generic 'T' to satisfy a Partial<T>?

I wrote some code in TypeScript:
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};
function getThing<T extends Point>(p: T): Partial<T> {
  // More interesting code elided
  return { x: 10 };
}

This produces an error:

Type '{ x: 10; }' is not assignable to type 'Partial<T>'

This seems like a bug - { x: 10 } is clearly a Partial<Point>. What's TypeScript doing wrong here? How do I fix this?
