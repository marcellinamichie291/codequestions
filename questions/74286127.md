I have an app where I am playing an HLS(.m3u8) video on screen. I want to share that video on other apps like whatsapp, instagram etc.. As far as I checked it is only possible to share mp4 video file on other apps. Can somebody help me here with by suggesting how to convert .m3u8 to .mp4. Sample .m3u8 url is: https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/img_bipbop_adv_example_fmp4/master.m3u8. I am using AVPlayer to play these videos.
Xcode, swift, AVPlayer, .m3u8
