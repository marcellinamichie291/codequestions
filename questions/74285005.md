# Strange characters show up after running firebase emulators


Hello everyone. I'm trying to run this command
firebase emulators:start --only functions

However, this weird characters show up. I wonder if this is a terminal issue or not because I tried several terminals but they all have the same result. Or maybe it's an OS bug. I just updated my macOS to Ventura a few days ago but it would be really great if you guys can show me some solution on this problem. Thank you!
I tried to execute the command through vscode terminal and on my mac's terminal. The same result still appear.
