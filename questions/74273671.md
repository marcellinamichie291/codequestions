# Incorrect UART receive message with 9600 baudrate

I am using a NUCLEO-G071RB. I implemented this modbus library: LINK. For testing I use ComTest Pro. Everything worked fine in the beginning. Then out of nowhere I started getting issues with 9600 baudrate. Some bytes get cut off and sometimes appear in the next response. This error only appears with 9600 baudrate. Baudrates 2400, 4800, 19200, 38400 and 57600 have worked correctly this far, but I also need to be able to use 9600.
I am new to STM32 and MCUs in general and the fact that errors only appear with 9600 BR is even more confusing to me. When I was using an STM32F446RE, the library worked fine and I didn't have any issues. Same issues appear when using an STM32F030R8.
Has anyone experienced same kind of issues?
EDIT: Out of nowhere it started working again, just like it stopped working. I even tried with project I didn't make any changes to and that works also, even with different RCC and clock configuration settings. Definitely interesting and I am more than sure it will stop working again at some point.
This is my RCC setup:

This is my USART setup:

This is my clock configuration:

I have tried different clock configurations and USART parameters, but haven't found any success so far. I read the reference manual, but didn't get any help from that either.
