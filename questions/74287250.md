everyone. I just want to ask if is it possible to combine the submit and upload buttons into one button? For example, I have a form that have fields (name and email), and I can also upload files.
I don't have a code for this but I'm asking if this was possible?
In the upload, it only has the select file button and doesn't have any upload button. So, when I input my name and email in the fields and chose a file, I want that one button to submit it to the database.
I did try having a separate button for upload but when I upload files, the information I input in the name and email fields will be erased.
