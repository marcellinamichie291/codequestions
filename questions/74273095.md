# Async run copy files task in pyside2

I'm making a ui program to copy files.
And I put some button to control it like this.

I use a thread and asyncio to get path from a txt and then copy files.
class CopyThread(QThread):

    def run(self) -> None:
        self.running = True
        asyncio.run(self.main_process(unix_local_path, unix_remote_path))

    async def main_process(self, local_path, remote_path):

        async with aiofiles.open(PATH_LIST_FILE,
                'r+',
                encoding='utf-8') as file_list_io:
            async for line in file_list_io:
                if len(line.strip()) != 0:
                    remote_file_path= line
                    local_file_path = remote_file_path.replace(
                        remote_path, local_path)
                    assert self.running
                    await aioshutil.copy2(local_file_path, remote_file_path)

    self.running = False



Is it a correct way to do this? I feel it seems slower than multithreading. But if I use multithreading, I don't know how to pause it correctly. Any idea can be helpful. And sorry for my poor syntax.
