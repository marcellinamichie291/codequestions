The file 'Icon'$'\r' appears in every sub folder of Google Drive. I want to exclude the file from my backup using rsync from Mac to NAS.
I use the command
rsync -arh --files-from=/Users/john/backupsource --exclude-from=/Users/john/exclude --delete /Users/john/ rsync@192.168.0.2::NetBackup/Mac 
In the file exclude I tried the following (and more)
*/'Icon'$'\r'
*/Icon\#015
*/Icon^M

Unfortunately I was not able to exclude the file 'Icon'$'\r'.
Does somebody have a general idea, how to exclude files with special characters from rsync?
