# Create a Data Warehouse with the database on SQL Developer

I have a database in SQL Developer which pull data from an ERP tool and I would like to create a Data warehouse in order to connect it then to PowerBI.
It's my first time that I am doing all this process from the beginning so I am not so experienced.
So where are you suggesting to create the Data Warehouse (I was thinking on SSMS) and how can I connect it with PowerBI ?
My Data Warehouse will consist from some View of my tables and some Joins to get some data in the structure that I want since it is not possible to change anything in the DB.
Thanks in advance.
