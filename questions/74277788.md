# Java: cast Object to HashMap<String, Object>

I am trying to cast an Object to HashMap<String, Object> in a neat, robust way. So far, every way I tried produces compiler warnings or errors. What is the proper way to do it? I have checked the internet and tried the following:
HashMap<String, Object> map = (HashMap<String, Object>) object;

The code above gives an unchecked conversion warning.
HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
if (object instanceof Map<String, Object>){
    map = (Map<String, Object>) object;
}

The code above gives an error, which says that objects cannot be compared to parameterized collections.
HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
if (object instanceof Map){
    Map genericMap = (Map) object;
    for (Object key : genericMap.keySet()){
        if (key instanceof String){
            map.put((String) key, genericMap.get(key));
        }
        else{
            throw new KeyException();
        }
    }
}

The code above yields a warning that "Map is a raw type. References to generic type Map<K,V> should be parameterized."
So what would be the proper way to do this? Thank you in advance!
