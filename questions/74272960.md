# What are the options for animating browser graphics without using canvas or transparency?

I have a client that needs a browser based user-interface with complex moving, constantly changing graphics.
Example of the kind of graphics we need to support, it must flow smoothly, at least 10 frames per second (the gif-conversion is making the annoying choppiness of the image):

 

We traditionally implement this using the LibGDX library to generate 2D graphics on the fly.
However the client sternly demands we follow some directives that make the traditional method forbidden and since we are not web developers we are stymied on what methods remain to be used, if any.
Allowed:

pure javascript
html/css

Not allowed:

canvas
frameworks (ajax, jquery etc)
transparency effects
> 8-bit images

Solutions we thought about but did not test yet so we don't know how viable they are:

Generate the full screen graphics in the backend and transfer to browser 10 times/second
Generate the changed parts of the screen in the backend and transfer to browser up to 10 times/second (less bandwidth/image decoding than #1)

We looked at CSS Animations but not sure they help since they have limited functionality.
Are there other solutions/capabilities of the browser (chromium 69-compatible) that we can use to enable this kind of graphics?
