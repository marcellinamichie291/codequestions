# Mysql query performance issue in mysql 8.0

I am migrating my Java project backend from MySQL 5.6 to 8.0.
Some queries are performing well in 5.6 but degraded on MySQL 8.0. While investigating further, it is found that one optimizer switch condition_fanout_filter is introduced in MySQL 8 whilch will be on by default.
In my case, when I execute
SET optimizer_switch = 'condition_fanout_filter=off';

MySQL 8 query performance improved and matched with 5.6.
Is there any generic solution for this?
