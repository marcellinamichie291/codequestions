# How to configure vscode for reading C project?

Recently I am learning ICS with the source code of nemu/NJU, but I got problems while configuring the vscode.

vscode keeps giving me red errors of macros/variables is undefined while already defined in other directory/makefile, how can I configure the c_cpp_properties_json file to avoid nonsense errors like this?

vscode abort with errors while pressing ctrl + F5  for debug. How can I configure the tasks.json to debug in such a big C project?



I've tried a lot to fix problem 1 like adding macro to c_cpp_properties_json "configurations"/"defines" manually. It helps but there are too many macros to add.


I am forced to use vim with plugins (tremedous tool too).


For problem 2, I can debug with make gdb in terminal. So it is not emergency.

Anyway, is there a better way to configure vscode for my problems?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
