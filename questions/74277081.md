# Restart CMD and continue script

I am currently setting up my new work pc and thought of writing a batch script to install our teams standard tools in order to provide that to newcomers or others who get a new laptop. I'm installing tortoise svn silently and afterwards I directly want to execute svn checkout command. As I know I cannot do this from the same cmd window as changes to env variables don't apply for the current container, I do:
:configuresvn
    ECHO setting up tortoise svn repo...
    ECHO please provide username and password when asked...
    start /wait cmd /k svn checkout -r HEAD --depth infinity %svnrepo% "%svntarget%"

but in the new window it still tells me svn is not known as a command and in fact path is not updated (kind of the same session but two windows?). If I manually open a new cmd it works.
How can I "really" open a new cmd window or kind of restart mine between installation and configuration of svn and continue the script?
