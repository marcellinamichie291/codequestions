# Ubuntu 20.04 sshd service start failed

I messed up shhd_config and after reinstalling openssh-server, I could not get ssh.service into working. (active)
After I messed up with sshd_config file, I restart and could not connect to server(the ubuntu). So, I connected by screen sharing(very painful) and reinstall openssh-server packages and reset the config file to default.
However, the sshd service did not active as planed. It still remain in loaded(inactive)
I use sshd -t to debug and find "SSH Privilege Separation" in /run/sshd
so I create /run/sshd mannually.
I could not start the service.
So, I mannually start the sshd by /usr/sbin/sshd
When I log in, it also pops up "System is booting up. See pam_nologin(8)" on login in by root.
It suggests that /etc/nologin file still exist.
And also the ssh service did not start.

Is there any way or command that I could check? what's wrong with sshd service?
Do simply delete /etc/nologin file fix ssh.service ?
Any suggestions are welcomed
