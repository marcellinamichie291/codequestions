# (Vue, Typescript) text css is not partially applied in Iphone Safari

(I'm using a translator. I'm sorry if the sentence is weird.)
Hello, I am making a web page using Vue3(Nuxt.js) and TypeScript. It's made available for both desktop and mobile.
bottom.vue
<template>
    <div class="text">
      <p class="info">{{ bottom[0] }}</p>
      <p class="more">{{ bottom[1] }}</p>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const bottom: string[] = [
  'hello |  name:LEE  |  num: 000-1234-5678  |  happier',
  'More information!!',
];
</script>

<style lang="scss" scoped>
.info {
font-size: 13px;
      line-height: 20px;
      color: #b3b3b3;
}
.more {
      font-size: 12px;
      line-height: 20px;
      color: #666666;
}
</style>

The code cannot be released in full. Please understand.
When I enter the web page with iPhone Safari, I can't see the number part of string[0] 'num: 000-1234-5678'. 'num:' is visible.'hello', 'name:LEE', 'happier' are all visible. But I can't see the numbers after 'num:'. I mean, on the web page, it looks like -> hello | name:LEE | num:             | happier
It looks normal on desktop and Android. It's only weird on the iPhone Safari. :( CSS is being applied normally. Ios is the latest version. Does anyone know the answer to this? Or is there a related issue??
