I WILL PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE COLUMN SOMEWHERE BELOW
I am a beginner developer on my own FiveM server. and can't seem to find a way to sort money in ascending and descending order by the amount of money. I am using phpMyAdmin for my server.
different players
{"money":900,"black_money":0,"bank":2401}
{"money":928,"bank":5800,"black_money":1427}
I don't know what to do, I am a beginner.
I don't think that you could sort for example by the "bank" word because I think my database is pretty awful at the moment and for some players, it might be:
{"money":928,"bank":5800,"black_money":1427}
and other players
{"bank":5800,"black_money":1427, "money":928}
Is there a way to sort the players' money by bank, money, and black_money? so it would show up like this:
Player 1: "money": 928
Player 2: "money": 900
AND SO ON
