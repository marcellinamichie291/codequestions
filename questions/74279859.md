Hello I am working on brick game and I need to set screen width and screen size and I would like to set it in another file called Main. I am doing this project in BlueJ and also I have available file, that creates windows and make there canvas. Is the
This is my Main file:
public class Main {
    private int screenWidth;
    private int screenHeight;
    public Main() {
        this.screenWidth = 100;
    }
    public int screenWidth() {
        return this.screenWidth;
    }
    public int screenHeight() {
        return this.screenHeight;
    }

This is file which creates window with canvas:
public class Platno {
    private static Platno platnoSingleton;
    public static Platno dajPlatno() {
        private static Main main1;
        private int screenWidth = main1.screenWidth();
        private int screenHeight = main1.screenHeight();
        if (Platno.platnoSingleton == null) {
            Platno.platnoSingleton = new Platno("Brick Game", screenWidth, screenHeight, 
                                         Color.white);
        }
        Platno.platnoSingleton.setVisible(true);
        return Platno.platnoSingleton;
    }

    private JFrame frame;
    private CanvasPane canvas;
    private Graphics2D graphic;
    private Color pozadie;
    private Image canvasImage;
    private Timer timer;
    private List<Object> objekty;
    private HashMap<Object, PopisTvaru> tvary;

    private Platno(String titulok, int sirka, int vyska, Color pozadie) {
        this.frame = new JFrame();
        this.canvas = new CanvasPane();
        this.frame.setContentPane(this.canvas);
        this.frame.setTitle(titulok);
        this.canvas.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(sirka, vyska));
        this.timer = new javax.swing.Timer(25, null);
        this.timer.start();
        this.pozadie = pozadie;
        this.frame.pack();
        this.objekty = new ArrayList<Object>();
        this.tvary = new HashMap<Object, PopisTvaru>();
    }

I tried call function 'private static Main main1;' before method 'dajPlatno()'. I am expecting, that when I run file Main it automatically run other files and set parameters to constructors, so player dont need to run other files and type some informations to constructors.
