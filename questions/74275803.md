# How to infer types from modular scss exports?

I have found a way to import scss variables into ts and js using this article
Basically the approach is:
Create a modular scss file containing your scss variables, or import them from the original files using @use.
// _globalVars.scss

$mobile-breakpoint: 900px;

// exporterFile.module.scss

@use './globalVars'

$new-variable: red;

:export {
  mobileBreakpoint: globals.$mobile-breakpoint;
  newVariable: $new-variable;
}


As you can see above, the required variables were exported using the :export{} syntax. These can then be imported into a JS or TS file.
import myScssVars from 'exporterFile.module.scss'

console.log(myScssVars); // { mobileBreakpoint: '900px', newVariable: 'red' }

Unfortunately these are imported as a readonly key value string pair.
.
How do I infer the actual types for the variables set in scss?
