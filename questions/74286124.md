# GKE Autopilot with HPA

The steps I use to set up a custom metrics HPA work on a standard GKE cluster but do not work on an Autopilot one.
I use an custom-metrics-stackdriver-adapter to implement an HPA based on the number of unacknowledged PubSub messages.
In both cases (Standard and Autopilot), I end up with the correct idle status situation with a number of running nodes corresponding to minReplicas.
However only the standard GKE correctly increases the number of pods up to maxReplica in case of traffic.
The only difference between the 2 piece of code is how I create the clusters.
In the GKE standard:
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--region=$REGION \
--project=$PROJECT_ID 

In Autopilot GKE:
gcloud container clusters create-auto $CLUSTER_NAME \
--region=$REGION \
--project=$PROJECT_ID

Maybe this is due to the fact that autoscaling/v2beta2 is not compatible with Autopilot? Should I use autoscaling/v2 instead?
What else could it be?
