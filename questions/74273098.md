# Why does the cell my image is in not resize with my image?

I'm trying to make a table with 4 cels and in each cell an image. I'm trying with a test image now but whenever I put the size of the image in % (I want the image to resize with the window) the cel the image is in stays the width of the original  image. So the image resizes, but the cel the image is in does not. Only width though, the height does resize. If I put the image size in px, it does work. But that's not what I want... I tried putting the image in my html code, but I get the same result. So I want the image size to be in % so that when you change the width of the window, the image resizes with it.
This is my html code:

    <!--pictures-->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><div class="image1"</div></td>
            <td>pic 2</td>
            </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>pic3</td>
            <td>pic4</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

        

And this is my css code:

table,tr , td{
    border:1px solid black;
    margin-left: 10%;
    margin-bottom: 20%;
}
td{
    margin: auto;
    padding: auto;
}
div.image1 {
    content: url(../afb/test.png);
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
}
