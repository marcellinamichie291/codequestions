# Adding package name to copyright profile in IntelliJ IDEA

I'm using Intellij idea. I need to add copyright for package name across the project
tried with ${PACKAGE_NAME} and $pacakage.name but no luck. Also, tried with
 $file.qualifiedClassName

but it gets the package along with class name.  Let me know the possible variable for getting the package name in copyright.
