# Split multiline text into class objects C#

I have the following multiline text from an other application and I want to split it into multiple objects to create class objects. Does anybody have a good idea how to do it?
App name: Name1 
crown2-flow-engine: false 
read-protected: true 
priority: medium 
version: 1.0.0 
copy-protected: true 

App name: Name2
read-protected: true 
priority: medium 
version: 2.0.0 
copy-protected: true 

App name: Name3
crown2-flow-engine: false 
read-protected: true 
priority: medium 
version: 3.0.0 
copy-protected: true 

In the end I want to have something like:

Object1(name, priority, version)
Object2(name, priority, version)
Object3(name, priority, version)

I know thtat this can be done by splitting the text but I'm looking for a more generic solution.
I tried to do it with regex but I already failed to seperate the text into 3 blocks.
