# How to make the lamps appear lit with opencv python

I'm trying to create an algorithm that makes all the light bulbs in an image appear turned-on. Essentially, I'm looking to supply the coordinates of different light bulbs in a photo and the algo should put light at those locations. Any idea on how to achieve this?
I tried looking for a solution but couldn't find a relevant one yet.
