# I want to insert a gif on html and then move it using CSS to center it properly

I want to move a gif on css but it seems like only width and height is working. I cannot move the gif , to center it properly.Below is the piece of code and also an image of how the gif should look like            
<img src="img/login.gif" width=20% alt="">

I use css code to move for it on page like
position : absolute;
right : 30%;
but it won't move, any advice
