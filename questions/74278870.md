# Working with Strings to convert to numeric value with range

I am working with the Texas business email dataset and i want to target all companies that have 25 to 300 employees. The Schema is currently setup with the employee count as a string with values like Employee_count: "25 to 300" "1 to 100" etc and others simply a single digit like Employee_Count: "10" , "3,000" etc. Is there a way for me to first parse the string so that it converts both numbers into a numeric range, Or at least get the larger of the two numbers,  so that i can grab companies by employee count ranges?
I tried using CAST, JSON_FUNCTIONS etc but i am also fairly new to SQL so any tips would be greatly appreciated.
The end result im trying to get is to get a list of employers with 25 to 300, 301 to 1,000.
