# Upgrade to TYPO3 9.5, getting Symfony RuntimeException... Command controller class "TYPO3\CMS\Lang\Command\LanguageCommandController" does not exist

I'm upgrading from TYPO3 8.7 to TYPO3 9.5 and am getting the following error. I don't see anywhere in my site extension that that controller is used and don't know what do to. This error is preventing me from using any typo3cms commands. Looked for answers on the Slack channel and else where but haven't found answers yet and am stuck.

Deleted all cache via the TYPO3 Install tool GUI
Manually deleted and rebuilt vendor and typo3temp directories.
