I am coding a guessing game where the user inputs an integer between 1 and 100 to try and guess the correct number (26). I have to count the number of guesses the user takes to get the correct number. I want to use try and except blocks to allow the user to keep trying until they guess it right.
Right now, my code only allows the user to input one ValueError. I don't want this, I want to keep inputting until I guess the number. Attached is my code. Any help is greatly appreciated!
ex:
I want to input errors ("a", 4.20, "hello") and still have them count as guesses until I guess the number
"a" > 4.20 > "hello" > 26 => Guessed it in 3 tries
def guess(n):
    secret_number = 26
    if n < secret_number:
        return print("Too low!")
    elif n > secret_number:
        return print("Too high!")


def try_exp():
    try:
        n = int(input("What is your guess? "))
        return n
    except ValueError:
        n = int(input("Bad input! Try again: "))
        return n


def counter():
    print("Guess the secret number! Hint: it's an integer between 1 and 100... ")
    n = try_exp()
    i = 0
    while n != 26:
        guess(n)
        i += 1
        n = try_exp()
    print(f"You guessed it! It took you {i} guesses.")


counter()
