# Named Form Action works locally but not when uploaded to Netlify

TLDR: SvelteKit Form works locally (with Netlify Adapter) but when uploaded to Netlify Server it returns 500 error code.
I am building Authentication into my SvelteKit app, and everything works perfectly on DEV and PROD, but when I upload it to Netlify (https://pazaral.netlify.app/) - it returns a POST Error {500} and doesn't do anything.
Same goes for the Register Page.
I'd really appreciate some help regarding this issue.
