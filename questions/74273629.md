# node red cannot GET /myfile from directory

I would like to ask.
I have file in C:\users\nxf68958\.Node-red\report.html
And when I would like to open this file by: localhost:1880/report.html
I get:
Cannot GET /report.html
in Log I have:  "Nov 09:52:00 - [info] User directory : \Users\nxf68958\.node-red"
I am using:
NR: 3.0.2
Node: 18.12.0
It worked perfectly on older versions of: NR: 2.2 and Node: 16.13.
Then I actualized and it stopped working.
In settings.js is option: "fileWorkingDirectory" I tried to change it, but without change.
What I am doing wrong?
Thank you
