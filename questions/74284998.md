# Hash opencv frames to memoize function (Python)

I'm replacing portions of a video with frames from a different video. I want the chosen replacement frames to be as similar as possible to the original.
I'm using this function to find the closest frame to the portion:
import functools
import cv2

@functools.cache
def closest_frame(frame, frames):
    return min(
        frames, key=lambda x: cv2.norm(frame, x, cv2.NORM_L2)
    )


This is an expensive computation because frames is really long. So I added functools cache. However, OpenCV frames can't be cached like that: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'
How can I get around this?
