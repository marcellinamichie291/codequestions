# How to initialize the initialized data section?

I do own linker script and crt for MIPS64
And cause of what Ive got a question:
How to initialize the initialized data section?
Should this filled by zero?
I have got MIPS64 and MIPS bare metal compiler(mips-mti-elf) and in my linker script I do initialization only sbss and bss section and my application works with en errors for while
Is it enough to initialize onf sbss and bss by zero?, if, in addition, apply RTOS
