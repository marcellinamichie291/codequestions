# Error connecting to IdentityServer from container. SSL connection could not be established

I can try connecting to IdentityServer container from other container on discovery endpoint over HTTPS
IdentityServer project was generated from template:
dotnet new isinmem

I'm only added container support in project, with config:
ports:
      - "5000:80"
      - "5001:443"

Client project is template console app, with code:
using IdentityModel.Client;

var client = new HttpClient();
var disco = await client.GetDiscoveryDocumentAsync("https://host.docker.internal:5001");
Console.WriteLine(disco.Error);
Console.WriteLine(disco.TokenEndpoint);

When I run client, he return error message:
Error connecting to https://host.docker.internal:5001/.well-known/openid-configuration. The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception..

Although if you go to the discovery endpoint page in the browser or via curl, it works correctly.
I tried generate self-signed certificates, it didn't help either
