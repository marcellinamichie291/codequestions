# how to determine if the service exists in shell

I want to write a function to determine if a certain systemd service exists, like below:
function serviceNotExists(){
    systemctl status $1 | grep -q not-found
    return $?
}
serviceExists test

I expect the output is: 0
but seems there is no any output whether I change the parameters of the function
