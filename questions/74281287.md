# How do I check if file modified in python as a boolean, so I can implement in IF Statement?

Im trying to create a function where if file modified, then perform task. I am able to do this if a file exists by doing -
import os
file_path = 'C:/Hi/'
if os.listdir(file_path):
  do xyz

But how can i do xyz based on if a files date was modified?
os.path.getmtime(file_path)

Only gets the time but cant be used in my if statement
