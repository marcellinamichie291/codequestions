# fastapi alembic exclude celery tables

My postgres database already includes celery backend tables (celery_taskmeta and celery_tasksetmeta) and when i use the following command:
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "some message"
the generated file includes dropping these tables in upgrade section.
I have already tried the answer provided for this question but it's not working.
