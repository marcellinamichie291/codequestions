# One step left to filter consecutive numbers in GPS data according to conditions

Many posts have been published about filtering desired data from a dataframe. I reviewed most of them and figured out there is a gap. Mainly, responders just tried to correct the code or recommend some line to solve the presented issue. So, I would be grateful if you recommend training resources in your resource to improve our knowledge about filtering the data.

I have a dataframe that includes 200 thousand records. It has three columns, Cycler's Id (CI), timestamp, and speed. According to CI, the time difference (TD) is calculated from subtraction between two succession rows. I used the groupby to calculate TD according to CI. Then, I dropped the CIs because the number of their records was less than five. In the presented data sample, CI "2" is eliminated because the number of its records was 2. Next, I counted the number of consecutive values whose time difference was less than seven and put them in a list for each CI. Obviously, each CI could have various lengths of successive values. For instance, in the shown sample, CI 1 has lengths 4 and 8.
What step is still left as the final step to accomplish the mission:
I need to check the generated list for each CI and save the records having maximum consecutive values in a new CSV file.
Following is my code and I need to complete this code or welcome a faster solution.
grouped = df.sort_values(by='timestamp').groupby('CI')
for i in grouped.groups.keys():
    p = grouped.get_group(i)
    if len(p.index)>13:
        p['Time_diff'] = pd.to_datetime(p['timestamp'].astype(str)).diff(1).dt.total_seconds()
        y= [len(list(g)) for k, g in groupby(p['Time_diff']<7) if k==True]
        if len(p['y']) !=0: 
            if max(y)>5:
################ till here, my code works perfectly ##########                
                ??? generating code to save only consecutive values having a maximum length 
                for each CI    
                p.to_csv('D:/out/'f"{i}.csv", sep=';')

Expected output:
In this case, only the last 7 records save in a CSV file.
Thanks in advance
