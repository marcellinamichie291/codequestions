# How to use wget to download StackOverflow webpage including the image it shows

I cannot see the image of Stack Overflow post. So I have to find some way to check the source code of the post webpage and find the image link, then download them one by one.
I hope to use wget command to download the post webpage together with the images it contains.
I tried several methods, but still failed.
Any idea?
Like this post: How to exclude certain tests in the Visual Studio Test Runner?
As you can see, the main post contains 3 images. I have to download the post and the images for overall 4 times to do downloading works now.

For SO post: How do I use Wget to download all images into a single folder, from a URL?
Its accepted answer gives a solution:
wget -nd -r -P /save/location -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png http://www.somedomain.com

And I tried it, finally got a file named .wget-hsts, and didn't get the post webpage and images it contains. Not work.
