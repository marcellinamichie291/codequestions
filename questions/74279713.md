# Classic HTML Page (with css and js script file) conversion to a React component

So I made a parallax horizontal scrolling html page with a single css file(style.css) and a js file(app.js).
My question is, how can I embed this page into an existing react project(with multiple pages and components)?
I already tried react helmet and copy pasting the  on a js react page. Does anyone have an idea?
