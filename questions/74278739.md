# Is there a way to dynamically create object names using string interpolation?

I am trying to parse large excel files and group extracted info into dynamically named objects.
For example, I would like to loop over the excel file and create List objects that name themselves after certain cell values:
(What I would like to do but isn't possible in C# Asp.Net Core):

public string cellData { get; set; };
foreach(var cell.Text in Spreadsheet){
     var hostColumn = sheet.GetColumn(3);
     var $"{cell.Text}"= new List<host;>();  
}


The goal is to auto create named Lists that I can later add data to and selectively save to the database but I can't do it in the above way.
String interpolation on variable names themselves isn't allowed and ViewData doesn't add anything unless I can instantiate lists that are equal to the quote text inside ViewData:
List<host> ViewData["whatever"]**.Name()**.ToString() = new List<hosts>();

(.Name here being a placeholder for an unknown method that would take the string from inside ViewData)
This results in circular logic and I don't even think ViewData has a method to extract its name.
I would prefer to loop over the excel file and dynamically create List objects that are named after cells as doing this with ViewData seems jenky. ViewData will also decrease performance this software is already lagging tremendously as it is.
