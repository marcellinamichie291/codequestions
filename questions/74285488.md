# How should i configure about images in pubsec.yml for nested structure

I've set simply the pubsec.yaml and it has been worked successfully as follows;

images/logo1.png
images/logo2.png

//pubsec.yml
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
//indents are set appropriately

However, it doesn't work when I restructure as following and with no changings is pubsecyml;

images/main/logo1.png
images/sub/logo2.png

image_provider throws errors like
  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderBufferCallback? decode, DecoderCallback? decodeDepreacted) async {
    if (decode != null) {
      ui.ImmutableBuffer? buffer;
      // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a
      // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.
      try {
        buffer = await key.bundle.loadBuffer(key.name);
      } on FlutterError {
        PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);
        rethrow;//here
      }
      if (buffer == null) {
        PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);
        throw StateError('Unable to read data');
      }
      return decode(buffer);
    }
