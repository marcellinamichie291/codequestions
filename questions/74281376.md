# Where is spelling corrections presented from Dialogflow cx?

I have "Allow ML to correct spelling of query during processing" enabled in the ML settings of my agent. From what Ive read, the corrected query should return in the either "text" or the "resolvedInput" parameter but there is no spelling corrections being made.
I am using nodejs package @google-cloud/dialogflow-cx version 3.1.1 and im calling the v3 API.
