# Cloudfunctions CNAME issue

I'm using Cloudfunction (Firebase), the URL is https://us-central1-xxx.cloudfunctions.net/check, I add a CNAME to it but it doesn't work correctly (404) How should I go about it?
My goal is GEO based routing on Route53.
I can solve this issue by configuring reverse proxy.
DNS and Reverse proxy configuration.
