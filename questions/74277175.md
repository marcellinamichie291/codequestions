After sending a post request to an api I get the following response body:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<header xmlns="mfp:anaf:dgti:spv:respUploadFisier:v1" dateResponse="202211011543" ExecutionStatus="0" index_incarcare="5001131564"/>

I need the index_incarcare value, how can I get it in a variable using php?
