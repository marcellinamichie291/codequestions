# Read PDf from all the pages

I am trying to read and print the text from all the PDF pages (59 pages).
I was able to print it but getting this error.
This is the code i have used.
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader(r'C:\Users\Dinesh\Downloads\1r41ai10801601_fong.pdf')
number_of_pages = len(reader.pages)
print(type(number_of_pages))

i=0
for i in range(number_of_pages):
    page = reader.pages[i+1]
    text = page.extract_text()
    print(text)

Is there a way we can avoid this error?
