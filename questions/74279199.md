# Local build error with turtle-cli, expo-cli

I’ve been struggling with this error last few days, I use an old mac book pro from late 2012 to create a local IPA file whit the turtle-cli v0.27.4, expo-cli v5.5.1, but this week I notice that my certificate was expired, so I created a new one on the apple developer site. Then I updated the profile with the currently active certificate, I download both of them, and after installing the certificate on my device and export a new .p12 valid Keystore I’m getting an error that says:
“error: exportArchive: No “iOS App Store” profiles for team ‘team_Id_###’ matching ‘certificate_serial_####’ are installed.”
*Could it be that my Xcode can not be updated from v11.3.1?
*What I’m missing, any advice?
