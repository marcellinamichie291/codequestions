# How to specify a partial razor page to use its own code-behind model

Is it possible to have a partial razor page inside of a full razor page, but have the partial razor page use its own code behind as the model, and NOT have a model passed to it?
Basically I want to be able to separate my razor pages into different "components" and have the ability to user razor syntax. So maybe my main page would be
AdminDashboard.cshtml (with its own code behind)
and then also have a _CreateUserModalPartial.cshtml (with its own code behind) with its own OnPost methods which I could call from the partial.
As of now, if I try to create this partial inside of the dashboard I get a complaint that its not receiving the correct model. Basically I don't want to have to supply it with a model, because it already has one.
I have tried not passing in a model as well, but it throws an error that its the wrong model type.
