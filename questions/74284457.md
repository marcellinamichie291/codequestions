# How to connect to 2 live datasets in a report?

I have a Power BI report and it allows me to get data using the import mode, direct query mode, live connect (to dataset) mode.
Also the recent feature allows me to convert the live connect mode to direct query mode so that I can combine live connect dataset with more data sources.
My goal is to connect my report to 2 live datasets in direct query mode. However, I am only able to connect to 1 live dataset in direct query mode and then get data from additional sources. Is connecting to 2 live datasets not supported?

When you use DirectQuery, composite models make it possible to create
a Power BI model, such as a single .pbix Power BI Desktop file, that
does either or both of the following actions:
Combines data from one or more DirectQuery sources. Combines data from
DirectQuery sources and import data.
