# Git switch branch without losing changes

I'm working on a project using Git for versioning. I'm now working on a feature in a different branch. I have not completed my changes but I need to switch to a different branch from master branch. I have tried to stash my changes with
git stash

But it's not stashing my changes.
I checked with
git stash list 
git status
