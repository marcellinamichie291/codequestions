# jenkins global environment variables from multiple properties file

i am new to jenkins and i can't figure out a way to inject multiple env variables without writing them one by one.
Before i used MultiJob Project where i can inject all env variables with properties files.
I have 3 properties file, that i want to use all of them as global env variables.
A properties file for example:
jzs_dir_rcs=all
jzs_dir_temp=_TempVersion
jzs_dir_vendor=vendor
jzs_path_rcs=${jzb_job_sandbox}/${jzs_dir_rcs}
jzs_path_temp=${jzs_path_rcs}/${jzs_dir_temp}
jzs_path_vendor=${jzs_path_rcs}/${jzs_dir_vendor}

This is what i am trying:
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment{
        script{
            readProperties file : name.properties
            readProperties file : name2.properties
    }        

    stages {...

I tried to readProperties function or tried to load the properties file in a key/value list, but for that i have to change all the source codes to use the list instead of env.variable.
In the source codes i use always os.environ.
