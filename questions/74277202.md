# Need to generate a table from XML file using Xquery - not sure where to start

I have order data stored in an XML as follows and I'm being asked to convert it into a table. As this is not part of my job description and I have no relevant qualifications for this I either have to seek external help or do it manually for ~4000 or so customers.
<Customer Name="John Smith" Method="Credit">

<Order Number="1">

<Item Code="INK001">
<Price>24</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 12</Details>
</Item>

</Order>

<Order Number="2">

<Item Code="PAPER001">
<Price>12</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 240</Details>
</Item>

<Item Code="INK002">
<Price>48</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 24</Details>
</Item>

</Order>

</Customer>

<Customer Name="Jane Doe" Method="Cash">

<Order Number="1">

<Item Code="INK001">
<Price>24</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 12</Details>
</Item>

</Order>

<Order Number="2">

<Item Code="PAPER001">
<Price>12</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 240</Details>
</Item>

<Item Code="INK002">
<Price>48</Price>
<Details>Quantity: 24</Details>
</Item>

</Order>

</Customer>

The hope is to end up with a table as per the screenshot attached, where every item for each customer has its own row.

From what I could find, apparently xQuery is the way to go, although it still didn't give me much of an idea where to start. I would appreciate if anybody more experienced than me could help out with this.
