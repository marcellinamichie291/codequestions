# What is the "properties" scheme in the URL "properties://browser/clickID"?

We're capturing error logs from the web console of people visiting our website. I noticed we started getting this error on the 1st of November 2022:

XHR error GET properties://browser/clickID

I searched around but I couldn't find anything related to this scheme. Any ideas what the "properties" scheme is?
Looking at the browsers this error appears in, it's exclusively Android and almost 99% Chrome, so I'm thinking maybe it's some new Chrome feature rolled out recently? It doesn't seem to be affecting anything, but I haven't been able to replicate it so I can't tell for sure.
