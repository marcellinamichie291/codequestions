# mongodb: random obfuscation name java script

I am trying to obfuscate a string and so far I have been doing the search with the following command in the table:
'name': {'$regexFind': {'input': '$name', 'regex': /(\S+)$/}}
Lets say the name is John, to create a random string instead.
Is there a quick and simple way to do this in java script?
