# React native style on View or Text in map rendering?

So I am watching a tutorial that says In React Native that to render a list of items you use the map function (nothing new, I know react) But he says that I should return a View element which has a Text Element inside it which holds my content. Example :
<View>
        {list.map((elem) => {
          return (
            <View>
            <Text key={Math.random()} >
              {elem}
            </Text>
           </View>
          );
        })}
      </View>

He said because view lets us use more styling features than text. But I wrote a different code in which I returned a Text Directly, applied styles to it, and worked ok.
<View>
        {list.map((elem) => {
          return (
            <Text key={Math.random()} style={styles.text}>
              {elem}
            </Text>
          );
        })}
      </View>

So should I return a <View><Text>{elemenet}</Text></View> or just directly <Text>{element}</Text>
