# Haskell check in list

I have a string which has several words in it, and I have to check if the first character is the same as the previous word last character. I've been told to use the the words built in function.
Here is what I've done:
validGame1 :: [String] -> Bool
validGame1 [] = True
validGame1 [x] = True
validGame1 (a:b:xs)
    |last a == head b = validGame1 (b:xs)
    |otherwise = False

but i'm getting exceptions when the input should be True
example : validGame "bread door room mad" (this should be True but it throws an exception)
validGame "bread car room mad" (this should be False and it works well)
