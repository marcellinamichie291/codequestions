# Customizing header title font size for Just the Docs Jekyll theme

I'm helping develop a website for a GitPages workshop and I'm new to Just the Docs theme. How can you change the font size for a long title that appears in the header/home link (top left of the screenshot). For reference, here is the Github repo.
Thanks in advance!

I tried to edit files in both the _includes and _sass folders but I either wasn't able to identify the correct file or I was unsure how to properly edit these files.
