# How do I write a regex to match the pattern "Day Month Date TimeStamp Year"?

I want to filter log data using python regex based on the format
"Day Month Date Timestamp Year" 
Example : Mon Mar 16 13:03:07 2020

Content of log file will look something like below
SR 194
1584363914  0   1   Mon Mar 16 13:05:14 2020    200002305   4
    bay18   cupMonitor
ssListProcessing.c      980

The precursor msgView, required for awStart was not found, so it will be removed.

EN 194

I want to match the the datetimestamp using regex and display the log associated with it.
However I'm able to match only "timestamp year" i.e 13:05:14 2020 part using the following regex
([0-1]?\d|2[0-3])(?::([0-5]?\d))?(?::([0-5]?\d)) \b(19|20)\d{2}\b

I need to match the entire format Mon Mar 16 13:05:14 2020
