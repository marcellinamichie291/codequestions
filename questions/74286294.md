# OnPhotonSerializeView callback is not working in photon pun2

I'm creating multi-play game using photon pun2.
I'm setted the components inherited from the IPunObservable to object contain a photon view.
but, OnPhotonSerializeView is never called.
This code is a function that synchronizes the position and others. but, it didn't work. and it doesn't catch a break point.
This object is created through PhotonNetwork.Instantiate, and here is the contents of the source and prefab.
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine;

public class Character : MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
    [Header("Properties")]
    public float hp;
    public float maxHp;
    public bool isMoving;
    public float moveSpeed;
    public Vector2 moveDirection;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        PhotonNetwork.AddCallbackTarget(this);
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        PhotonNetwork.RemoveCallbackTarget(this);
    }

/** skip **/

    public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
    {
        Debug.Log(nameof(OnPhotonSerializeView));

        if (stream.IsWriting)
        {
            stream.SendNext(transform.position);
            stream.SendNext(hp);
            stream.SendNext(maxHp);
            stream.SendNext(moveSpeed);
            stream.SendNext(isMoving);
            stream.SendNext(moveDirection);
        }
        else if (stream.IsReading)
        {
            transform.position = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
            hp = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
            maxHp = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
            moveSpeed = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
            isMoving = (bool)stream.ReceiveNext();
            moveDirection = (Vector2)stream.ReceiveNext();
        }
    }

}


Or is there anything I missed about OnPhotonSerializeView?
I understand that it repeats every second as many frames as specified by PhotonNetwork.SerializationRate or PhotonNetwork.SendRate.
sorry about my poor english...
I want to know about is why not OnPhotonSerializeView called or my wrong knowledge about that.
