# change of source foreach to other

Manager example 

// Create a new array
var gryfindor = [];

// Loop through each wizard
wizards.forEach(function (wizard) {
    // If the wizard is in Gryfindor, push to the new array
    if (wizard.house === 'Gryfindor') {
        gryfindor.push(wizard);
    }
});

my manager asked me to write this thing into in this bellow format 

// Create a new array from the wizard array
var gryfindor = wizards.filter(function (wizard) {
    // Only include wizards from the Gryfindor house
    return wizard.house === 'Gryfindor';
});

I need to change the foeeach in JavaScript but I don't know how to do anyone can write it or encode
    var isExist = false;    
    var cashoutIndex = 0;    
    CashOutData.forEach((item, index) => {    
    if (item.id === userBets[0][i].id) {    
    isExist = true;    
    cashoutIndex = index;        
    }    
    });    

Change of for each loop and faster the performance

answer as per manager required format
