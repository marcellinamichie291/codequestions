# Ambiguous use of operator '<' when comparing Doubles and Integers in Swift

Why does swift behave so weird when comparing Doubles and Integers?
Consider the following code for repl/playground:
12>12.0        //false 

13 > 12.0        //true
13.0 > 12        //true

13 >= 12.0        //true
13 <= 12.0        //false

12.0 < 13        //Error: Ambiguous  use of operator '<'
12 < 13.0       //Error: Ambiguous  use of operator '<'

What exactly is Ambiguous in the use of operator here?
The debug console output is not especially helpful either:
error: ambiguous use of operator '<'
12 < 13.0

UPD: Just to clarify, I know that I can cast values explicitly.
The question is why exactly does the language behave this way and was is it designed to behave this way with < operator?
