# Carbon Objects diffInMonths showing 0 when one date is 1st Nov and the other 1st Dec

I have two carbon objects
//$startDate
Carbon\Carbon @1667250000 {#3093 ▼
  date: 2022-11-01 00:00:00.0 Africa/Nairobi (+03:00)
}

and
//$endDate
Carbon\Carbon @1669842000 {#2920 ▼
  date: 2022-12-01 00:00:00.0 Africa/Nairobi (+03:00)
}

when I run dateDiffInMonths() on them I get 0 but I expect 1
$startDate->diffInMonths($endDate); //0

I have tried adding floorMonth() to objects but the answer is still the same.
When I get $startDate->diff($endDate) I get the following with days difference as 30
DateInterval {#3102 ▼
  interval: + 30d
  +"y": 0
  +"m": 0
  +"d": 30
  +"h": 0
  +"i": 0
  +"s": 0
  +"f": 0.0
}

What am I doing wrong?
