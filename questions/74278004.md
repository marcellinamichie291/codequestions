# SharepointDriveItem Preview URL to pen the document preview in SharePoint

I need to generate the preview URL of a document in SharePoint. For that I'm using the following code:
GraphServiceClient graphClient = await graphProvider.GetGraphServiceClient(authObject);
var preview = await graphClient.Sites[siteId].Drives[driveId].Items[graphId].Preview().Request().PostAsync();            
return preview.GetUrl;

But the problem is that the above code is returning the embedded URL ( https://myDomain.sharepoint.com/sites/***********/_layouts/15/embed.aspx?uniqueId=2436cab2-0727-4480-9750-*******&access_token=****) which is opening in OneDrive instead of SharePoint.

As per MSDNThe preview action is currently only available on SharePoint and OneDrive for Business. So My question is, What's the change we need to do to get the preview in SharePoint?
