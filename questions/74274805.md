# WinClose, WinKill, ControlDisable, ControlHide, etc. - Do not work

I have a problem with the functions I mentioned in the title. I will post a script bellow:
`
While True
    
    local $wList = WinList()
    
    for $i = 0 to UBound($wList) -1 
        if _ProcessGetName(WinGetProcess($wList[$i][0])) = 'dllhost.exe' Then
            if $wList[$i][0] = 'Internet Protocol v4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties' then
                local $wHandle = WinGetHandle($wList[$i][0])
                ConsoleWrite(WinClose($wHandle) & @crlf) ; > Shows True on Console but window still here
                ConsoleWrite(WinKill($wHandle) & @crlf) ; > Shows True on Console but window still here
            EndIf
        EndIf
    Next
WEnd

`
The purpose of this program is to close the 'Internet Protocol v4' window, if the program detects, that it is open. But whatever function I use. It does not work. The same problem I encounter if I use functions for Control manipulation like ControlDisable/ControlHide. What should I do. It seems to me, something blocks/prevents the program from executing these function. Can someone help me?
