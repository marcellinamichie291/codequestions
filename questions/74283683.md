# EOF Error occurs when trying to give a user input

I am learning python and have the following code in test.py:
string = input()
print(string)

Contrary to tutorials, it gives me an error:
    string = input()
EOFError: EOF when reading a line

I have no idea what I do wrong here! Any help appreciated!
