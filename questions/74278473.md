# What is this hexadecimal in the utf16 format?

print(bytes('ba', 'utf-16'))

Result :
b'\xff\xfeb\x00a\x00'

I understand utf-16 means every character will take 16 bits means 00000000 00000000 in binary and i understand there are 16 bits here x00a means x00 = 00000000 and a = 01000001 so both gives x00a it is clear to my mind like this but here is the confusion:
\xff\xfeb

1 - What is this ?????????
2 - Why fe ??? it should be x00
i have read a lot of wikipedia articles but it is still not clear
