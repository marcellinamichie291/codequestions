# The link interface of target <target> contains: <dependency> but the target was not found

Theres a lib having a Qt dependecy in its public link interface. When the client calls find_package it errors :
CMake Error at <path>/albert-targets.cmake:47 (set_target_properties):
  The link interface of target "albert::albert" contains:

    Qt6::Concurrent

  but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:

    * There is a typo in the target name.
    * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
    * An ALIAS target is missing.

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  <path>/albert-config.cmake:30 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)

Do I have to find_dependency for public link interface libraries in a CMake config? If I do a find_package in the config file, why would I have to put the libraries in the public link interface at all? Is the public link interface redundant? At least it does not make any difference for the client if the dependency is public or private if I call find dependency.
