I am building a Chat Application and I have represent the chats in Recycler view, but how do I save the position of the Recycler View. What I am saying is, if I have scrolled on to some certain positions, how do I get into the same position, even after the activity is destroyed? I tried a lot, went to documentation, YouTube tutorials, nothing is working!!
