I've got an admission dataset and i wish to make a site where one can enter their results in a percent like format from an examination and get a list of 5 colleges matching the percentile.
The dataset will be stored in a mysql server and the input received will be entered , the percentile will be matched o a range of possible ranks and then matched to the colleges according to that. Only problem is i don't know how to go about this.
