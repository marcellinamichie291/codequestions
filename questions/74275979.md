# SelectOutput blocked

I am designing a manufacture process and I using an assembler to package the components. The case is that there is  a limit number of components so when we ran out of one type of component I am trying to redirect the flow to another assembler in order to change the configuration.

The condition that I am imposing is that is true when the towerFactorystorage output is below 180. As you can see in  the picture below in the first lane the selectOutput7 changed but selectrOutput11 not when the condition is the same.
It looks like a component is blocking the selectOuput11 block. Any ideas on what is happening?
