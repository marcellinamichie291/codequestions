# Bash/How to "cut" the current day with cal?

I have the following script to highlight the current date in a calendar:
$ cal | grep --color -E6 "\b$(date +%e | sed 's/ //g')\b"

The result:

How can I cut a value with current date? I need to use the "cal" function.
$ date +%d

does not satisfy the task condition, unfortunately.
