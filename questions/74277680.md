# Binary combinations count

How can we find out the total count of combinations with number of continuous 0s <= 4 in n-bit binary numbers.
Example: Lets consider n=16-bit binary numbers. 2^16 = 65536 numbers.
The following combinations have continuous 0s <=4, so they are allowed -
1000011111111111 
1000010000100001 
1000100001011001 
0101010001000011
0101001000100001

The following combinations have at least one continuous 0s >4, so they must not be allowed -
1000010000011111
1000010000010001
1000000011011001
0101010000000011
0101000001000011

One way is to iterate through all n-bit combinations and filter the required ones.
However it will be feasible only for small n-bit numbers. Is there a faster way to determine it for large n-bit numbers.
Thanks.
