# Stacking Multiple Arrays In Query/Lambda Function

My question was inspired by this post in that I'm wondering if it's possible to create a formula to stack a dynamic amount of arrays based on a list (see below for clarification).
Sample Starting Data From Three Sources




ID
Amount




India
9


Delta
4


Hotel
8







ID
Amount




Alpha
1


Echo
5


Foxtrot
6







ID
Amount




Bravo
2


Gulf
7


Charlie
3



Desired final result:




ID
Amount




Alpha
1


Bravo
2


Charlie
3


Delta
4


Echo
5


Foxtrot
6


Gulf
7


Hotel
8


India
9




I can get the final result by using a query function as shown in this spreadsheet with a formula referencing the appropriate cells with fileID and range:
=Query({IMPORTRANGE(E2,F2);
    IMPORTRANGE(E3,F3);
     IMPORTRANGE(E4,F4)},"Select * where Col1 is not null order by Col1",1)

if you want to play with it in your own sheet, you could use this hard-coded function which is the same as above:
=Query({IMPORTRANGE("1WtI56_9mhyArMn_j_H4pZg8E0QdIBaKoJfAr-fDAoE0","'Sheet1'!A:B");
    IMPORTRANGE("1HamomAuLtwKJiFEtRKTuEkt--YDTtWChUavetBcAcBA","'Sheet1'!A2:B");
     IMPORTRANGE("1WtI56_9mhyArMn_j_H4pZg8E0QdIBaKoJfAr-fDAoE0","'Sheet2'!A2:B")},"Select * where Col1 is not null order by Col1",1)


My Question:
Is there a way to leverage a formula to generate this result based on the number of file ids and ranges in columns E and F? So if a fourth ID and range were added, the desired result in columns a and b would be shown? I suspect Lambda would work, but I am not as strong with it as I should be.
Unsuccessful attempt:
=lambda(someIDs,SomeRanges,IMPORTRANGE(someIds,SomeRanges))(filter(E2:E,E2:E<>""),filter(F2:F,F2:F<>""))
REALLY Bad Attempts:
=contact(Player()*1800-CoffeeBribe*Not(Home))
=company(theMaster(emailed)*(false))<>üêá
