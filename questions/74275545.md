# MATLAB Compiler Runtime versions 8.3 or 8.4 installers do not work

Since I haven't been able to find a solution online, nor get any answers on mathworks.com, I decided to see if anyone happens to have an answer here :)
I have been trying to install the versions 8.3 and 8.4 of MCR (I think it is the 8.3 I need) but neither of them works. The latest version of MCR installs without problem. I have been doing it via https://se.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html and also via the developer of the software I want to use.
This is what it looks like when I try to install it, independent of how I do it (I have Windows)
ERROR while installing
When the lower prompt is done, it closes both prompts and nothing happens. The text of the second prompt says that Windows is is defining the configuration of "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable", whatever that means.
I have been trying to find a solution online, but nothing has helped me thus far. I moved the installer to C:\Program Files(x86) but that did not help.
