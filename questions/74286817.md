# In my android studio, filter option was disappear

In my Android Studio, Filter Option was disappear.
In my Android Studio, there was a Filter Option like the red square in the picture below.

However, I don't know when, but the Filter Option has disappeared as shown in the picture below.

I want to see the log using "Show only selected application" in the Filter Option of Android Studio.
How do I make the Filter Options visible again?...
Note that,
I am using these versions.

Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch 1
Runtime version: 11.0.13+0-b1751.21-8125866 amd64
Android Gradle Plugin Version 7.3.1
Gradle Version 7.4
Bolt Toolkit version 1.14.7

(Likewise, the Filter Option was not shown in Android Gradle Plugin Version 3.6.3, Gradle Version 5.6.4 and AGPV 4.2.2, GV 6.7.1.)
And I have the following Event Logs.
File pattern '.log' (from 'Ideolog' plugin) was reassigned to file type 'log' by 'Bolt Toolkit' plugin
You can confirm or revert reassigning pattern '.log'
Confirm reassign this pattern to file type 'log' from plugin 'Bolt Toolkit'
Revert this pattern to file type 'LOG' from plugin 'Ideolog'
Edit file type 'LOG'
