# How to set environment variable for gradle wrapper command in gitlab CI?

./gradlew -i dev_task -Pdb_user=user1 -Pdb_pwd=pwd1

The above command works fine on windows and able to access environment variables, db_user and db_pwd, but not in gitlab CI when using the same command or exporting the variable before running the command,
Dev task:
  image: gradle:7.5.1-jdk11
  stage: dev-task
  before_script:    
    - export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_db_user=user1 # set env variable and didn't work
    - export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_db_pwd=pwd1 # set env variable and didn't work
  script:
    - ./gradlew -i dev_db_migration -Pdb_user=user1 -Pdb_pwd=pwd1  # set env variable here also and didn't work

In build.gradle, I am reading those 2 properties using
user1 = project.properties['db_user']
pwd1 = project.properties['db_pwd

Any suggestions how to set environment variable in gitlab CI and read it in build.gradle file?
