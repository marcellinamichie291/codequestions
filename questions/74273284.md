# Android / IOS Geolocation

we're developing a safety app and I'm wondering if there is any possibility to get the user location without any app installed on user side
Currently we're using the Window.navigator.geolocation api and routing the user to the webpage which will get the location if user have internet connection. works good
but we're searching for a way to get the user's geolocation in case if user doesn't have internet connection by sending a sms with a simple link ( smtg like sending a  <a href="geo:my_current_position"> through an mms maybe? ) and open the gps service and display on the user's screen the current coordinates
