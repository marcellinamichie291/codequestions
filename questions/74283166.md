I recently asked the question: Is ostream& operator<< better practice in a class than using std::cout? and got an excellent answer.
When I tried to implement the solution I got errors:
no operator "<<" matches these operands
and
binary '<<': no operator found which takes a right-hand operand of type 'LinkedList' (or there is no acceptable conversion)     
The simplest solution in this case would be to add a std::ostream parameter to your display() method, eg:
LinkedList.h
#include <iostream>

#pragma once

class LinkedList
{
   struct Node {
      int data = 0;
      Node* prev = nullptr;
      Node* next = nullptr;
   };

private:
   Node* m_head;

public:
   // CONSTRUCTOR
   LinkedList();

   // DESTRUCTOR
   ~LinkedList();

   void display(std::ostream& out) const;
};

LinkedList.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "LinkedList.h"

LinkedList::LinkedList() {
   m_head = nullptr;
}

void LinkedList::display(std::ostream &out) const {
   Node* curr = m_head;

   while (curr) {
      out << curr->n_data << " -> ";
      curr = curr->n_next;
   }
   out << std::endl;
}

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &out, const LinkedList &list) {
    list.display(out);
    return out;
}


Main.cpp (generates error)
#include <iostream>
#include "LinkedList.h"

LinkedList list;

std::cout << list;
