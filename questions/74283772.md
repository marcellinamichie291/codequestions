# Apache NIFI: A cluster or a single big server?

My flow is as below and is a cron job scheduling every 10 minutes:

Query data from a database. Every time the query result could contains 200 million records.
Use PartitionRecord to group records by the primary key of the above query result.
Transfer the group produced by PartitionRecord to a XML. It hard to say how many flowfiles a group contains.
Send the XML to ActiveMQ-Artemis.

I will use NIFI to approach the above flow (requested by my customer).
Now I have below computing resources:

OS: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
CPU: 48 cores
Memory: 384 GB
Storage: SSD, enough space.

And There are two options I can think of:

Build a NIFI cluster composing of three nodes. Each node has 16 cores and 128GB RAM.
Build a single NIFI with 48 cores and 384GB RAM.

Which options of NIFI platform should I use ?
Thanks
