# How to not show the overlay image after navigating to new view in swiftUI

I have a button for an SF symbol that does a swiping animation effect in .overlay() so it stays at the top, but after I navigate to another View the SF symbol is still there. I wonder how I can have the view reset before going to a new View or have the .overlay unshow after navigating.
structure is something like this
    var body: some View{
      NavigationView{
         NavigationLink{
             destination: WelcomeScreenView()
         }
      }
      .overlay(
        Button(action:{}, label:{
           Image(systemName: "chevron.left")
             .gesture(
               DragGesture() 
               // the animation goes here
             )
        }
      )
    }
