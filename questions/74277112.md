# Can I change a JSON key from string value to an array of value in JS

Hi I would like to check if there's a way to convert one of my JSON property's value from string to an array of string.
What I have:
const testJSON = {
  "name": "Albert"
}

What I want:
const testJSON = {
  "name": ["Albert"]
}

Many thanks for any help and direction I could explore!
