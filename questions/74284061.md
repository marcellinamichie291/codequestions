# Using Apps Script to find longest route using Google Maps

So I have a small script that I am using to find the distance between locations using Maps. Most people would want to use the shortest recommended route, but I am trying to find the longest. Here is the start of the current script:
function googlemaps (start_address, end_address) {

start_address = "Starbucks, 799 A St, Hayward, CA 94541";
end_address = "Hayward BART Station, 699 B St, Hayward, CA 94541";

var mapObj = Maps.newDirectionFinder();
mapObj.setOrigin(start_address);
mapObj.setDestination(end_address);

var directions = mapObj.getDirections();
Logger.log(directions["routes"]);
Logger.log(directions["routes"].length);

};

When I look on Google maps for the directions of the above address, I can see that there are three possible routes, but when I try to find the length of the array, it just says 1. I'm not sure what I am missing
