# Openpyxl - For loop not iterating through entire column

I am writing a script which uses 3 files.
File 1 "testReference", has the string which will be searched in Column B of File 2 "testData". If the string is found in Column B, it will copy the associated number in Column C and paste it in File 3 "testTemplate" while sorting it based on the value in Column A of File 2.
My current script will stop either when it reaches the first condition, or if the first condition isn't met in the first row will not output anything. To fix the former, I've tried increasing mr3 by 1, but that didn't work. To fix the latter, I've tried using a while loop, but then the script never stops executing.
To help make everything clear, I've attached a screenshot of the content in each file as well as the expected output. Any ideas where I am going wrong?

from openpyxl import load_workbook
from openpyxl import Workbook

wb = load_workbook('testReference.xlsx')
wb2 = load_workbook('testData.xlsx')
wb3 = load_workbook('testTemplate.xlsx')

ws = wb['Sheet1']
ws2 = wb2['Sheet1']
ws3 = wb3['Sheet1']

mr = ws.max_row
mc = ws.max_column

mr2 = ws2.max_row
mc2 = ws2.max_column

mr3 = ws3.max_row
mc3 = ws3.max_column

for i in range(2, mr + 2):
    for j in range(1, mc + 1):
        if ws.cell(row=i,column=j).value == ws2.cell(row=i,column=j + 1).value and ws2.cell(row=i,column=j).value == "A":
            ws3.cell(row=mr2 + 1,column=j).value = ws2.cell(row=i,column=j+2).value
        elif ws.cell(row=i,column=j).value == ws2.cell(row=i,column=j + 1).value and ws2.cell(row=i,column=j).value == "B":
            ws3.cell(row=mr2 + 1,column=j + 1).value = ws2.cell(row=i,column=j+2).value
        elif ws.cell(row=i,column=j).value == ws2.cell(row=i,column=j + 1).value and ws2.cell(row=i,column=j).value == "C":
            ws3.cell(row=mr2 + 1,column=j + 2).value = ws2.cell(row=i,column=j+2).value
            mr3 += 1

wb3.save('testTemplate.xlsx')
