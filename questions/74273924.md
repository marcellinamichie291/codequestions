# get data from the api NY Times

I have API Data (ny times article) ,I need get data from the list inside another list ... and the api style like that :
result [{
.
.
.
"media": [
      {
.
.
.
"media-metadata:[
   {
    "url":"............",

    }]
  }] 
}

so how can get the url from media-metadata ?
and I use packages :
flutter_bloc

build_runner:
analyzer:
built_value_generator:

to generate files and methods
I need the url from the api to display photos on the screen of application
I made 3 classes the first class is the basic one (article) and class for media & another class for media-metadata now how can collect the data from each other ?
