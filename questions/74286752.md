# Text over Appbar from unknown source

I'm working on a mobile app and I'm using a scaffold to display some title but for some reason, I recently found that on some android devices, there is some text coming from an unknown source and it's displayed over my Appbar. I can't reproduce that same result on any other device or emulator.
This is how it should work

and for some reason this is what it does

I checked to see if I have that text somewhere in my code and it's not. Another weird thing is that... that text is added only when I click the home button from the bottom bar. Again, that text is not added there from code. Already checked multiple times.
