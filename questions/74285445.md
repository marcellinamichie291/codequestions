# HangFire Implementation in .NET Core

I am new to Hangfire implementation in .NET Core.
But I could not understand some points. It would be a great help if anyone could clarify.

Does Hangfire Server start peeking the hangfire db when first job is pushed or at regular intervals? If it is at regular intervals, what is the default interval?

Does number of queues in the Hangfire server will reserve that many threads for the background

Does each background job type has separate thread? If not
a. What happens to delayed and recurring jobs if a Job in queue is under execution?
b. What happens to delayed job if recurring job is under execution?

Is it possible to add a recurring job on the application start?
