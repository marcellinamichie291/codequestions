# How to use Mongo Compass Filter to drill down into object properties?

This is literally my first foray into Mongo.  I have exported my Active Directory into a Mongo collection.  It's structure, as best I can describe it as a complete novice, is a row, with an object containing properties which contain an array of one string.  (See attached image for clarification of my limited vocab).

My question is, I want to filter to a specific "givenname".  What do I put in filter to do that?  I tried {givenname: "Test"}, but it matches nothing.  I suspect because I have to drill all the way down through the multiple layers.  Probably something like:
{Properties: { givenname: 0: {"Test"}}}

I really do not know the json syntax ('cause that's what it looks like) to go from row, to property {} object, to column [] array, to array element 0, to value "Test".
