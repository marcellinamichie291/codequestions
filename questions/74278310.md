# Power DNS forwarding zone

I created a new subdomain in pdns and set a forwarder to an external dns. The firewall is open and we can reach that dns, but the forwarding doesn't seem to be working. This was setup in forward-zone list using the hostname=ip. Any advice would be helpful. This is on a Centos 7.3 machine.
Thank You,
I get connection timed out when I lookup that zone. It should point to the dns server above.
