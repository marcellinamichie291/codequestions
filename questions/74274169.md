# SSH VM hack using RSA and Password

So I am currently using a vm enviornment to practice SQLi and SSH pen testing.
I have managed to conduct successful SQLi attacks and have been able to gain a user as xxx@localhost.
When you attempt to SSH into this account it asks you to confirm the RSA key which has been done as I have also been able to get the RSA. I have changed my current RSA.Pub to reflect this. However it also has a password request as well.
I have attempted to use metasploit but it doesnt seem to be helpful. I have attempted to run exploit ssh_login via the aux exploits and it wont allow me to conduct this stating that there is a validation issue with the user_file and pass_file and I do not have the capability to use Hydra, ssh2jon for example.
I am kind of stuck. The logic i tried to apply is by changing my id_rsa.pub I would be verified and potentially be able to get into the account. I am fairly new to this so I really cant think of what I can do to actually get into the system.
For information : I am using Parrot as my OS and the IP I am attacking is running Debian
Summary: I have got the local host, and I have got the RSA. I do not have the password/ entry into the actual shell
