# Factorial Analysis return to original atributes

A little explanation first im working on a unsupervied clustering model using factorial analysis and KMeans.
I have a dataframe with 10 columns where i performed a dimensionality reduction to n=3 using factorial analysis, after that i used KMeans to determine 4 clusters. Using the method estimator.cluster_centers_ i got the center coordinates of every cluster.
fa = FactorAnalysis(n_components=3) 
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_f = scaler.fit_transform(df)
X_f = fa.fit_transform(X_f)

estimator = KMeans(n_clusters=4, n_init=2, init="random", random_state=1)
estimator.fit(X_f)
centers = estimator.cluster_centers_

Here is my question, i need to determine the original atributes (in the 10 columns dataframe) of every center point of the clusters given by KMeans, how can i proceed?.
Since the center points are not part of X_f, i dont know how to continue.
