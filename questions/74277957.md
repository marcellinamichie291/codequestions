# Regular expression match for specific lower_case php validation

I need to compose a regular expression for string, with a max length of 6 characters, containing only Latin letters in lowercase, with an optional underscore separator, without underscore starting and trailing.
I tried the following
^[a-z_]{1,6}$

But it allows underscore at the start and the end.
I also tried:
^([a-z]_?[a-z]){1,6}$

^(([a-z]+)_?([a-z]+)){1,6}$

^([a-z](?:_?)[a-z]){1,6}$

But nothing works. Please help.
Expecting:
Valid:
ex_bar
Not valid:
_exbar
exbar_
_test_
