# Can a VirtualBox instance that has a bridge network on it access another network?

First of all, I'm really sorry if I am asking a super dump question. I've searched everything on the internet but couldn't find the right answer.
I'm building a K8S cluster on VirtualBox using Vagrant. All instances are successfully configured to the network (192.168.57.1 "my physical router, and the physical server has connected with it"). My laptop has connected to the same router but in a different subnet (192.168.94.1), and if I ping and ssh to my physical server (which is 192.168.57.11) it works fine. But if I ping or ssh to the instance (it has 192.168.57.121) I created on my physical server, it doesn't work. Then my physical server connects with the instance through ssh or ping. The physical server and instances connect are working fine with each other, but not working with a different network.
Here is the Vagrantfile:
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

  config.vm.provision "shell", path: "bootstrap.sh"

  config.vm.define "etcd1" do |etcdnode|

    etcdnode.vm.box                 = "generic/ubuntu2004"
    etcdnode.vm.box_check_update    = false
    etcdnode.vm.box_version         = "3.3.0"
    etcdnode.vm.hostname            = "etcd1.example.com"

    etcdnode.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.57.121"

    etcdnode.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|
      v.name    = "etcd1"
      v.memory  = 2048
      v.cpus    = 2
    end

  end

end

If I do traceroute to 192.168.57.121 (the VirtualBox instance) from 192.168.94.x:
traceroute to 192.168.57.121 (192.168.57.121), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
