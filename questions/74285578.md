# John the Ripper Custom Rules

Hi How do I write custom rules to suit this criteria?

exactly 12 characters long

comprised of a five to seven characters word followed by a seven to five digits number accordingly so password would be exactly 12 characters long

word characters are all lowercase except for any one letter


This is my working so far
l >4 <6 T0 $[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]
l >5 <7 T1 $[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]
l >6 <8 T2 $[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9] 

I want to write rules to get one uppercase letter anywhere in the password
