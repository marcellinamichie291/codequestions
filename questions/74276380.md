# Multiple testWidgets tests are not working in flutter integration test

I'm using google flutter integration driver to automate the flutter mobile app.
I want to write multiple widgetTests in a single main_test.dart file.
First test is running successfully, but when second test starts i see Test starting...(attached screenshot below) screen in emulator, but actually not moving forward to launch the app screen.

And finally, getting below error saying that Bad state: No element as screen is not loaded.!


Failure Details:
Failure in method: check value increments
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞═════════════════
The following StateError was thrown running a test:
Bad state: No element

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:

Here is my integration test file main_test.dart:


import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:get_it/get_it.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
import 'package:sparrowmobile/flavor/uat.dart' as app;


void main() {
  final binding = IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  binding.framePolicy = LiveTestWidgetsFlutterBindingFramePolicy.fullyLive;
  
  group('sanity test suite', () {
    //runs before each test
    setUp(() async {
      app.main();
    });

    //runs after each test
    tearDown(() async {
      final getIt = GetIt.instance;
      await getIt.reset();
    });

    testWidgets('sample test', (tester) async {
      await tester.pumpAndSettle(const Duration(seconds: 5));

      // ensure title is visible
      await tester.ensureVisible(find.byKey(const ValueKey('startButton')));
      await tester.tap(find.byKey(const ValueKey('startButton')));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
      expect(find.text('Home Screen'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('Transactions'), findsOneWidget);
    });

    testWidgets('check value increments', (tester) async {
      await tester.pumpAndSettle(const Duration(seconds: 10));

      //ensure title is visible
      await tester.ensureVisible(find.byKey(const ValueKey('startButton')));
      await tester.tap(find.byKey(const ValueKey('startButton')));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    });

  });
}



Can anybody help here me to run multiple widgetTests in a single file?
