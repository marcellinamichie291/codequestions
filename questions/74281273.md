# convert object sender from a DataGrid to a defined object

I'm struggling with the following.
I have a DataGrid, where the user is allowed to remove rows.
I want to detect which rows and do something with that.
I'm almost there, however I can't solve how to convert the output to the object type i want.
Casting doesn't help. The output is "{ name = Category1, type = income }".
Now I could use some string operations the filter out the things I want, but doesn't feel right. Can someone help please? Thanks!
    private void datagridCategories_PreviewKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        string categoryDeleted = "";
        var grid = (DataGrid)sender;
        if (Key.Delete == e.Key)
        {
            foreach (var row in grid.SelectedItems)
            {

                string test = row.ToString();
                categoryDeleted += test + "\r\n";
            }
            MessageStatusLabel(categoryDeleted);
            //Output is:
            //{ name = Category1, type = income }
        }
    }
