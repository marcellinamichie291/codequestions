# Customizing snippet/other CS JSON API response fields

My requirement is to retrieve all email ids from web pages returned by Custom Search JSON API. I am referring the 'snippet' and 'og:description' fields of API reponse and retriving all email ids contained in these fields using regex match.
However in many cases, email ids present in webpages are not there in these fields. Hence, I am unable to get email ids from those webpages.
Is there is anyway to customize these(or any other) fields so that I can get email ids contained in webpages in Custom Search JSON API response.
We can customize snippet and og:description fields by adding/modifying structured data in html code however this can't be done in my case as I don't own the websites returned by Custom Search JSON API.
Thanks!
