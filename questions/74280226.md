# Hide the badge number when it is 0 using React and Typescript

I am developing a Badge component. I want to hide the Bade when the number is 0.
I tried this on codesandbox. I am using invisible as a prop. This has a class "invisible". I am not sure how to apply this class when the batchContent is 0. I tried but it's not working.
Not sure if using useState would help. Please help me with this. Thanks.
