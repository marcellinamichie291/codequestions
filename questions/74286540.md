# Specflow - Scenario Outline. Tests are not run from TFS

I am trying to fix the problem when tests are not running when TFS (2015) build is started.
Tests that don't have Scenario Outline - "Examples" are run without problems, but tests with "Examples" are in pending state.
xUnit is used with Specflow.
Nuget packages that are installed in project:
Specflow.xUnit (v.3.9.58)
xUnit (v.2.4.1)
xUnit.runner.visualstudio (v.2.4.0)
This started to happen when Specflow is updated to version (3.9.58)
Before update to new version everything was working fine.
Previous version of Specflow was 2.2.
I have tried to to add SpecSync tool but can not get it to work.
Beside that I don't know what else can be done to resolve this problem.
