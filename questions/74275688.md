# socket.io and redux: how to get access to the state?

I'm trying to work with socket.io/react/redux. The server emits new array of objects every 5 seconds. The client catches the array, and I want to .map() the data with my HTML layout.
Redux reducer gets the array from server and returns new state. The problem is I can't access to the state, because I don't know how. All I can do is 'console.log(action.payload)' - and there are really holds the array from the server.
How can I get access to the store in App.js?
