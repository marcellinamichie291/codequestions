# Migration of Applications to newer .NET Framwork version necessary or just update runtime?

Imagine you have an old .NET Framework Application, built with v4.6.1 (Target Version 4.6.1).
The runtime version 4.6.1 is out of support:
https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework
Is it necessary to migrate the application to a supported version (e.g. 4.6.2 or higher), when there are no errors after testing the unmodified application on a 4.6.2 runtime?
Or is it ok to just update the runtime on the server?
The same goes for example an .NetCore 3.1 application. This runtime will be unsupported at the end of 2022. Do I have to migrate the app or just update the runtime?
