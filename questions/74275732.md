# Set Content root pah to a dotnet core app (ASP.NET Core)

I'm starting my ASP.NET Core API using a script from a different directory (not dll's directory)
The problem is that the default Content root path is the script's directory.
How can I change it to the dll's directory?
It only works when starting the script from the dll's directory
