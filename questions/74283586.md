# Convert the data type of the value of the dictionary from floating point to percentage with two decimals, remove some punctuation

Suppose I have a dictionary d, the data type of the value is float, since this value is the accuracy rate. So I want to convert it to a percentage:
d = {'import': 0.5833333333333334, 'export': 0.4166666666666667}
d.values()
d.items()
for k, v in d.items():
     d[v] = d[format(v,'.2%')]

The ultimate goal is to remove the quotation marks and curly braces on the key, and convert it into a string to pass in the title of a matplotlib plot:
plt.title(f"Models accuracy is :\n{str(d)}")

The title of the figure will become like this:
Models accuracy is ï¼š
import: 58.33%, export: 41.67%

How to achieve this?
