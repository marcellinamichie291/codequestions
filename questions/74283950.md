# How to store a large amount of text data in SQL Server 2019

I have a post data includes image and content, when I save it like text in SQL Server I am using the nvarchar(MAX) datatype, but it is not showing anything when I edit in row.
But when I select, the data does show up.
How to fix it? And does SQL Server have another type of data to store instead of nvarchar?
