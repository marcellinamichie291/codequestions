# Timeout in proptotype ajax request

I have a JSP page in which I am making an ajax request. For ajax I am using protoype.js.
Below is how I am making the call.
 new Ajax.Request('<%=strActionPath%>/executeProcess.do?', {
    method: "get",
    parameters: {
        "id": "222222221",
        "serialNumber":"111",
        "mode":"validate";
    }, 
    onSuccess: function (response) {  
         alert("Process done");
   },
)};

Problem is background process takes lot of time and my ajax calls gets 504 response. I am feeling if I add timeout or wait in this request this may solve my problem.
I am not able to find how to add timeout in prototype ajax request. Can any one suggest here please ?
