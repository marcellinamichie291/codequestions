The C code
#include <stdio.h>

int x[] = {3, 10, 4, 25, 33, 6, 2, 0};

int main(){
    int total = 0;
    int *pointer = x;
    while (*pointer != 0) {
        if (*pointer < 10)
            total = total + *pointer;
        pointer++;
    }
    printf("The total of things less than 10 is %d\n", total);
}

which produces the output The total of things less than 10 is 15, as it should.
These are the variable name changes I made for the MIPS assembly:
total    -> t0
pointer  -> t1 
*pointer -> t2
10       -> t3 

The MIPS assembly I have right now, which doesn't work:
    .data
x:  
    .word 3, 10, 4, 25, 33, 6, 2, 0
text:
    .asciiz "The total of things less than 10 is "
newline:
    .asciiz "\n"

    .text
main: 
    li $t0, 0
    la $t1, x
    li $t3, 10
    j while
while:
    lw $t2, 0($t1)
    beq $t2, $0, done
    blt $t2, $t3, update
    addi $t1, $t1, 4
    j while
update:
    add $t0, $t0, $t2
done:
    la $a0, text
    li $v0, 4
    syscall

    move $a0, $t0
    li $v0, 1
    syscall

    la $a0, newline
    li $v0, 4
    syscall

    li $v0, 10
    syscall

I just don't see how they aren't equivalent. Can someone help?
