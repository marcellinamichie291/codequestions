# Filter the products where your calculated options generate a profit result

I need to filter for each of the products, which are the distances that are profitable using them.
In the example below, using car the profitable distance is 3 and skate the profitable distances are 3 and 5:




product (column A)
distance (column B)
profit/loss (column C)




car
3
-1


skate
5
1


skate
7
2


car
7
-1


skate
7
-3


car
3
3


skate
5
-4


skate
5
6


skate
3
2




So the result I would like to get would be this:




options (column E)
distances (column F)




car
3


skate
3,5




Column E:
=UNIQUE(A1:A)

Column F:
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(E1:E="","",JOIN(",",FILTER(UNIQUE(B1:B),SUMIFS(C1:C,A1:A,E1:E,B1:B,UNIQUE(B1:B))))))

I tried to use FILTER and combine with SUMIFS, but it generated error in divergent size ranges.
I would like to know if there is any way I can make this filter somehow for each of the objects and that I have the freedom to increase the number of products according to the time (that's why I combined it with ARRAYFORMULA, so I don't get stuck adding line-by-line formulas)
Edit 1:
Why 7 is not included in Profit for Skate:
Because at distance 7, we have the values 2 and -3, so it becomes a return -1
Edit 2:
Why 3,5 in Profit for Skate:
Because at distance 3, we have the value 2, so it becomes a return +2
Because at distance 5, we have the values 1, -4 and 6, so it becomes a return +3
