# React Dropdown Menu

I'm trying to create simple 2 dropdown component on react. It will be one with select and another one without the select tag, and it will have submit button at the end. When the user submits the selection, must get a message as a result at the bottom with selected items like " You have selected {option} and {option}. I have created the options but can't get the selected items as a result, it would be great if anyone could help.
