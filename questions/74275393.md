# Could not find a declaration file for module for a Non Typescript NPM Package

I created a skeletal NPM Package all written in javascript and the type was set as module and pushed to Github package registry.
After importing the package into a test project I am getting the warning:
 Could not find a declaration file for module 
    @org/packageName'. '/Users/../../index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/xxx` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing  

I didn't use typescript anywhere in the project.
Below is a sneak peak view into my package.json file:
{
  "name": "package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
}

Why am I getting this warning even though I didn't use typescript?
