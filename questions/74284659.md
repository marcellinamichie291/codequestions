# mongodb - How to update a value inside an array?

I am trying to update the following row:
{
    "_id": "80a7",
    "title": "Is React better than Angular?",
    "options": [{
        "option": "Yes",
        "vote": 0
    }, {
        "option": "No",
        "vote": 0
    }],

Assuming in api/vote, the value passed is "Yes", How can I update the vote for Yes by $inc by 1 ?
  const {id, option} = req.body;

  const db = await getMongoDb();

  await db.collection('polls').updateOne(
    {
    _id: id,
    },
    {
      $set: {
        options: ???,
      },
    },
  );

What should be ??? replaced with?
