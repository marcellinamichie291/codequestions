# more than one endpoint configuration for that contract was found

I have a question about my soap services(wcf)
I implement my wcf service and all the function implement correctly at compile time
I do not have any compile time error but when i run my code I received this error message

An endpoint configuration section for contract 'test.ICore' could not be loaded because more than one endpoint configuration for that contract was found. Please indicate the preferred endpoint configuration

I think in soap services we need some change in web.config file
another point is that my project have multiple soap services.
may it cause a problem?
how can i solve this issue?
thank you so much
