# Loop though over the sheets and filter VBA

Trying to loop though the worksheets to apply the filter on date, and copy all the filtered data into a "Report" sheet.
Here is code, which loops only the first sheet ( USD) and not the second one (EUR).
Sub SheetLoop()

Dim Ws As Worksheet
Dim wb As Workbook
Dim DestSh As Worksheet
Dim Rng As Range
Dim CRng As Range
Dim DRng As Range


Set wb = ThisWorkbook
Set DestSh = wb.Worksheets("Report")

Set CRng = DestSh.Range("L1").CurrentRegion
Set DRng = DestSh.Range("A3")

For Each Ws In wb.Worksheets
    If Ws.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
    Set Rng = Ws.Range("A1").CurrentRegion
    
    Rng.AdvancedFilter xlFilterCopy, CRng, DRng
    
    End If
    
    
Next Ws

End Sub
