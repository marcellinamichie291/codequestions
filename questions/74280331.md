# TypeScript: how to add multiple elements to an array of the same values

I would like to add multiple elements that all have the same value to an array of objects   Something like '.push()' but with a count.  I know I can do array.push(a, b, c), but I want to be able to do something like:
person {
firstName: string;
lastName: string;
age: number;
}

people: Person[];
numberPeople: number;

// some calculation to generate numberPeople, example: 23

person.push( {firstName: '', lastName: 'Smith', age: 0}, NumberPeople)

I know I can use a loop structure (for (i=0; i<NumberPeople;i++) person.push) but that gets cumbersome.
Is there an easier way?  I'm relatively new to JavaScript and TypeScript.
I've tried .fill() but that doesn't let me specify values.
thanks,
I know I can create my own function ( mpush(obj, count) ) but I would rather use something more elegant and standard, if there is something.
