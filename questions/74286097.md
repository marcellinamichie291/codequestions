# Finding Camera Matrix from known Points python

I have 8 3d points of a 3D model and 8 2d points of that model's real world photograph. is it possible to get the camera matrix of that camera using these 3D and 2D points?
here are the 3D points
      X       Y        Z
0   0.098   35.484   16.58
1   17.34   38.638   16.28
2   27.65   44.133   0.083
3   17.23   38.678  -16.25
4   0.068   35.536  -16.58
5  -17.24   38.799  -16.06
6  -27.67   44.402   0.379
7  -17.10   38.820   16.21 


here are the 2D points
      X      Y   
0    777    203
1   1015    217
2   1142    440
3   1019    662
4    778    675
5    542    660
6    425    442
7    546    219


what would be the camera matrix for this scenario and How can I get it using python
