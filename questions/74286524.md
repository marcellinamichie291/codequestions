# Open any type of local files using default installed application in flutter

I have an old project that is not nullsafety. I'm currently using open_file: ^3.0.3 package for opening files. But with recent google play policy, REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES is not allowed. Is there any flutter package that has the same function but still has a none nullsafety version? Or a native code that will do the same function? I've seen
open_file_plus
open_filex
open_file_safe 

but they don't have a non nullsafety version.
