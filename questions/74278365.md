# Docker notification on new image version

I am trying to build a docker image which is based on the official node docker image and was wondering if there is some way of automatically rebuilding the image when a new version of the official node image gets pushed. So that my image isn't based on an outdated base image.
Maybe there is some way like rss-feed, where updates to the official images get published, so that I could listen to that feed?
Or is there some other way to get notified by new images on the official docker-registry?
