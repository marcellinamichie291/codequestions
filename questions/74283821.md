# Append serialization failed for writer : Java BigQuery Streaming Write Client

Got a BQ Java Streaming Client that throws an exception when trying to write to BQ table. Here is the link to the java class (https://filedropper.com/d/s/hHCsNUz1Vklwc8OPFQv6Kv6sJN0ckg).
and the exception I got

com.google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.Exceptions$AppendSerializtionError:
Append serialization failed for writer:

Anyone knows what the issue is and how to fix it?
