# How to change what page an ASP.NET Core web application opens at?

I have created a ASP.NET Core web application - with razor pages and not MVC - I am trying to change the default page in which it opens on to be the Login page (identity login) instead of the index, and then once logged in it will open at the home/index page.
Most articles I've looked at have either been MVC or have a startup class which mine doesn't - I have the new minimal program.cs - any help would be greatly appreciated.
I tried looking in properties for anything that was similar but couldn't find anything.
