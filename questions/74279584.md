# Cannot open URL (works otherwise in web)in R

I am trying to load a dataset directly from kaggle (without having to download it on my local machine first). For this, I referred different solutions on stackoverflow to come up with the following code:
library(httr)
dataset <- httr::GET("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/download/", 
                 httr::authenticate("kguliani", authkey, type = "basic"))
# destination file 
temp <- tempfile()
download.file(dataset$url,temp)
data <- read.csv(unz(temp, "heart.csv"))
unlink(temp)
head(data)

I believe it should work but I keep getting the error message:
Error in download.file(dataset$url, temp): cannot open URL 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/download'

This URL works just fine in the web and lets me download the archive.zip(that contains the target file 'heart.csv') file. Can someone pls guide me to why the url is not working?
(I edited the question to take out my authkey since I wasn't sure if I should share it). To reproduce, feel free to use your username and authkey instead. Thank you!
