# Route Model binding in Laravel

I have a Laravel app and a model Category. It has a relation to itself called parent
Category.php
public function parent(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(self::class, 'parent_uuid', 'uuid');
}

I'm trying to make this kind of URL,
ex.: domain.com/mobile-phones/smartphones
('mobile-phones' - category's parent, 'smartphones' - category itself)
In the routes file it should be:
Route::get('/{parent}/{category}', ...)->name('category');

Is there a way to code so i use just one Route Parameter?
For example:
Route::get('/{category:parent}/{category}', ...)->name('category');

Also a way so that in blade files when i generate the url to use just the category.
route('category', ['parent' => $category->parent, 'category' => $category]); // No
route('category', $category); // Yes

I have tried making the route binding as follows:
/{category:parent}/{category}

But it gives the error that the parameter category can be used just once.
