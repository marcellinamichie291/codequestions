# Pass derived class members to base class constructor

I have the following piece of code that is working but I don't understand why it works (inspired by a real life code base):
Base class definition:
class Pointers {
private:
    int* Obj1;
    double* Obj2;
public:
    Pointers(int* Obj1_, double* Obj2_) : Obj1{Obj1_}, Obj2{Obj2_} {}
};

We now derive a class from our base class where we shadow the two pointers with an int and a double of the same name:
class Objects : public Pointers {
public:
    int Obj1{69};
    double Obj2{72};
    Objects() : Pointers(&Obj1, &Obj2) {}
};

Within the constructor of Objects we call the constructor of Pointers and pass the adresses of Obj1 and Obj2. This actually works: The (shadowed) pointers will point to Obj1 (69)and Obj2 (72).
My question is: Why is this working? I thought that in the first step the base class members are constructed (which are the two pointers) and only after that the derived class members (the int and double with the same name) are constructed. How can we pass these objects adresses to the base class constructor in the first place?
