# What are other types of modifiers in C# other than access modifiers

I am looking for documentation of modifiers in C#. All am getting from the internet is the access modifiers. That is public, private, protected.
My question is what of other modifiers? Which category are they? (Modifiers like static, abstract and partial).
Java categorizes them as non access modifiers. What of C#?
Tried searching in Google and YouTube.
