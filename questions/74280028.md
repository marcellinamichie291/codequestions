# Is there an alternative for checking range.Find() that is concise as `If not range is nothing then`?

Background:
When verifying that a range was found via range.find(), I have historically used something like:
Dim foundRange as Range:  Set foundRange = sheets(1).usedrange.find("moo")
If Not foundRange is Nothing then debug.print foundRange.address

Having never really deviated from this, nor put too much extra thought into it, to date, I guess it might as well be time to challenge what I know/use.

Inquiry:
Is there any inherent equivalent to this check that does not require the Not modifier nor a UDF (e.g., Exists(range) which still uses the Not modifier or does a check via dictionary)?
I would suspect that if not range is nothing is about as concise as one can be, but here we are to have the conversation.
