# How do you create a drillable Pivot Table in R Shiny like in Excel?

Looking to create a drillable Pivot Table in R Shiny based on X rows by X columns for example.   The examples I found online would show multiple rows by 1 column but I want to be able drilled down across different columns.
I found examples online that only shows X rows by 1 column that can be drilled down.
