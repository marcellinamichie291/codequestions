# What's the maximum number of contacts I can have in Microsoft Outlook 2019 (offline Desktop version for Windows 10 , 64 bit)?

What is the maximum number of Contacts I can keep in Microsoft Outlook 2019?
I use the offline version on a desktop computer running Windows 10 (64 bit).
I read the maximum number of items allowed per folder is 100,000.
Suppose Contacts is a folder, does this mean the maximum number of people I can keep in Contacts, therefore is 100,000 people?
If I need to have say 500,000 contacts, what can I do?
Thanks
