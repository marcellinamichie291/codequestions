# jQuery UI Dialog won't open after closed once

I know there have been a lot of questions about this, but I haven't found anything working for my case.
$('<div id="mydiv"></div>').html(myhtml).dialog({ 
  dialogClass: 'myclass',
  modal: true,
  closeOnEscape: false,
  open: function(event, ui) {
    $(".ui-dialog-titlebar").hide();
  }
});

Now I'm trying to close it from outside trigger using:
$('#mydiv').dialog('close');

After the closing works, it won't open again. Any advice?
