# I need to append all the appropriate variants to an array in ClickHouse, but Case statement doesn't allow such a thing

It is an example of two conditions, but in fact there are more. So, if (item_1=1 and item_v_1=1) then I put result_1. Sometimes there is another working condition and 'result_1' is rewritten by 'result_2' and 'result_2' can be rewritten by 'result_10' and so on. I want to consider all  satisfying  variants and in result have an array of 'result_1, result_2, ...' or just 'result_1' if there are no other conditions applicable. Is there a way to do this? I realised that CASE statement is not working is such sutiation, though I don't have any other ideas

I tried some things with arrays, but that won't work with case statement. And there are around 50 items I need to keep in check, so I don't think it would be wise to do it using lots of IFs
