# MQTT.Simple Loses Connection to AWS IoT

I have a Raspberry Pi Pico W that I am trying to get to communicate with AWS IoT, and after about 12-24 hours it seems to lose its connection. I have the keep alive set and I can see it's pinging the server. And then it suddenly stops.  I'm going to add some code below to show the connection and stuff, but I'm baffled at this point (I am cross-posting this on other Raspberry Pi sites too).  Any thoughts on why I can't keep the connection open?
    DeviceID='PicoTestBed03'
    PORT=8883
    AWS_ENDPOINT={My AWS API End Point}
    DISCONNECTED = 0
    CONNECTING = 1
    CONNECTED = 2
    state = DISCONNECTED
    KeepAliveSeconds = 60

       
    #Use Websockets
    useWebsocket = False

    #Create SSL Params object
    #Assume the cert, key, and rootCA are all created correctly because my connection is successful

    SSL_PARAMS = {'cert': cert, 'key': key, 'server_side': False, "cert_reqs":ssl.CERT_REQUIRED, 'cadata':rootCA}


    #Create MQTT Client
    client = MQTTClient(DeviceId, AWS_ENDPOINT, port=PORT, keepalive=KeepAliveSeconds, ssl=True, ssl_params=SSL_PARAMS)

    #Connect MQTT Client
    while state != CONNECTED:
    try:
        state = CONNECTING
        print('AWS TEST: Trying to connect via MQTT...')
        client.connect()
        state = CONNECTED
    except Exception as e:
        print('AWS TEST: Could not establish MQTT connection')
    continue

print('AWS TEST: MQTT LIVE!')

device_shadow_last_checked = time.localtime()    

while 1:
    #{Does some other stuff not relevant to this ask}
    if (time.mktime(time.localtime()) - time.mktime(device_shadow_last_checked)) >=60:
        client.ping()
        device_shadow_last_checked = time.localtime()
    client.check_msg()
