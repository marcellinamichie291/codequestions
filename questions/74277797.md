# Factors that contribute to XGBoost slower training time on SageMaker distributed vs single-instance

I want to create a module on distributed training to fulfill the customer's request. I'm editing this notebook by adding a few lines of code (below) to run the training using FullyReplicated and SharedByS3Key with two instances for training to show how the customer can use distributed training with XGBoost.
I successfully run all three training types -- single, distributed:sharedbys3key, and distributed:fullyreplicated. However, the training time for the single took 3 minutes, whereas the distributed both took longer (6 & 7 minutes, respectively).
Why would the distributed training in this case be slower? The training data is only 500 records. Does the small sample size affect training size and the smaller size would actually make distributed training slower? Would it be faster if the training set was significantly larger?
I'm using the same hyperparameters for all training types, and everything else is the same. The only difference between the jobs are the instance count (1 versus 2), and the S3DataDistributionType for the two distributed training methods.
