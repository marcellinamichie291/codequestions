# SVG animation in Angular 14

I have animation in my component
animations: [
  trigger('start', [
    transition(':enter', [
      style({ 'stroke-dashoffset': '620' }),
      animate(15000, style({ 'stroke-dashoffset': '0' })),
    ]),
  ]),
],

thats worked fine before Angular was updated to version 14.
Now I get warning, and animation doesn't work
Warning: The animation trigger "start" is attempting to animate the following not animatable properties: stroke-dashoffset
(to check the list of all animatable properties visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)

There is no SVG properties that can be animated. So, how I can realise animation?
