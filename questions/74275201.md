# How to add a name attribute to a Ktor HTML DSL textarea?

I am currently struggling to add a name attribute to a textarea.
It's supposed to look like this in HTML:
 <textarea name="comment">Enter text here...</textarea>.
For example in Ktor HTML DSL I can do this with an input field:
textInput(name = "username"), but it doesn't work for a textarea.
Is there a way to add a name property?
Maybe someone has some experience with Kotlin Ktor and HTML DSL.
Thank you.
