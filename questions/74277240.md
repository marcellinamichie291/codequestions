# InsecureRequestWarning. Everything seems updated, but I still get the warning

Checking the logs of a file transfer program using Python 3.6 and requests 2.18.4, I found the warning
InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised
So, I did:
pip3 install git+https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi
which terminated in successfully installed certifi-2022.9.24
Great! But I still get the same warning message in the log!
I then checked the requests version:
# pip3 install requests
Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages (2.18.4)
Requirement already satisfied: chardet<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 in /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages (from requests) (3.0.4)
Requirement already satisfied: idna<2.7,>=2.5 in /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages (from requests) (2.6)
Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.23,>=1.21.1 in /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages (from requests) (1.22)
Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages (from requests) (2022.9.24)

Though not the latest requests version, the newer certifi does get noticed.
Am I missing something else?
