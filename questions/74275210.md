# Sort data alphabetically across 2 sections

I have the following code:
$check = array('person a','person c');
$data = array('person c','person a','person d','person e');
define('check',$check);
//asort($data);

print'<pre>';print_r($data);print'</pre>';

usort($data,function($a,$b){
    return empty(check[$a]) ? 1 : $a <=> $b;
});

print'<pre>';print_r($data);print'</pre>';
exit;

What I am trying to achieve is:
person d
person e
person a
person c

What I get is
person e
person a
person d
person c

Because person a and c are in the $check array, I'm trying to sort my array based on alphabetically for those not in the $check group and then those who are. I could probably split things up a bit and am not overly familiar with the usort custom functions, but is it possible to acheive it this way?
