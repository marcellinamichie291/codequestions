# How to equate player's score with seconds passed using Time.deltaTime in Unity?

I would like to relate player's score with a number of seconds passed since the start. I don't want to use System.Timers.
So far I have got this code:
void Update()
    {
        if (!playerControllerScript.gameOver)
        {
            if (playerControllerScript.doubleSpeed)
            {
                score += 2 * Time.deltaTime;
            }

            else
            {
                score += 1 * Time.deltaTime;
            }
            
            if (Math.Ceiling(score) != Math.Ceiling(score) - 1)
            {
                Debug.LogFormat("Score: {0}", Math.Ceiling(score));
            }

            else
            {
                Debug.Log("Bug");
            }
    }

The terminal keeps updating score variable every frame instead of every second. I wonder how I should properly check if Math.Ceiling(score) is indeed greater than the previous one.
