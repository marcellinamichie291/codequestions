# How to customize rows in R [gt] package

I am trying to create a stratified summary Table 1 for publication. I have several variables from the survey that were “check all that apply” (service_1:service_4. I would like to group them under the row heading “services” and then indent them on the table to match the indentation of the rest of the variable responses. How do I go about doing this in gt and/or gtsummary?
Additionally, no participant clicked “service_4”. How can I get the table to display the yes response “0 (0)”, rather than the default no responses?
table1<- data1 %>% 
  select(collect, survey_location, age3, relationship, education2, religion2, 
         sex, marital, med, visits, 
         service_1, service_2, service_3, service_4)


table1 <-table1 %>% 
tbl_summary(by = collect, statistic = list(all_categorical()~"{n} ({p})"),
            missing = "no",
            digits = all_continuous() ~ 0,) %>%
            add_p()%>% 
  add_overall() %>% 
  modify_header(label ~ "**Variable**") %>%
  as_gt() %>% 
 tab_header(
    title = md("**Table 1. Demographics**")) %>%
   opt_align_table_header(align="left")

I tried using the tab style but keep coming up with an error. I could not figure out how to do it either for multiple rows
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text (indent=2),     
    locations = cells_stub(
     columns = variable,
     rows = variable == "service_1"))
