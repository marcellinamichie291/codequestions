# Vaadin Grid: setAutoWidth(true) with recalculateColumnWidths() works only for visible rows in the grid

After I setup the a Grid with all the columns with setAutoWidth(true) and I execute grid.recalculateColumnWidths() this will auto-adapt the columns width with the content of the columns but only for the rows that are visible in the grid.
What happen is that scrolling rows in the grid I can find some cells with content larger than the content on the first visible rows and they were not auto-adapted and so the content is truncated (es FOO...)
Considering that I am using ListDataProvider, so all the rows are loaded into memory when I build the grid, why it is not calculating the right width for every column considering all the rows?
Is this a normal behaviour? It is possible to change it to consider all the rows when it is calculating the columns width?
I am using Vaadin version 14.
Thanks for the help
