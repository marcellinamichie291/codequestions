# Filter out tuples with only one element

I have a tuple containing coordinates for a list of nodes. The process I am attempting to complete needs a tuple with only 2-tuple or 3-tuples. I am trying to filter out any 1-tuples.
G=nx.read_shp(r'C:\TestData\tl_2019_36013_roads.shp')
pos = {k: v for k,v in enumerate(G.nodes())}
X=nx.Graph() #Empty graph
X.add_nodes_from(pos.keys()) #Add nodes preserving coordinates
edg=[tuple(k for k,v in pos.items() if v in sl) for sl in l]
print(edg)

A portion of this output is:
[(38, 9848), (40, 41), (40,), (10, 42)]

So in this case, I am attempting to filter out the entry: (40,) as it is only a 1-tuple.
