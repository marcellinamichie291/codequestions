# Surprisingly valid Ruby syntax: % everywhere

In Ruby 2.7 and 3.1 this script does the same thing whether or not the % signs are there:
def count(str)
  state = :start
  tbr = []
  str.each_char do
%  %case state
    when :start
      tbr << 0
  %  %state = :symbol
 %  when :symbol
      tbr << 1
 %  % state = :start
 %  end
  end
  tbr
end

p count("Foobar")

How is this parsed? You can add more % or remove some and it will still work, but not any combination. I found this example through trial and error.
I was teaching someone Ruby and noticed only after their script was working that they had a random % in the margin. I pushed it a little further to see how many it would accept.
