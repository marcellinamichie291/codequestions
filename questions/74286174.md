I want to know how to get the name of the user who scan my QR Code.
I am currently building a system (android and web) that can record student engagement activities to events or programs organized by the university. An application such as e-log is developed and it has a scanner function. Students must log in and the app will have their details such as fullname, student id, faculty, year and so on. Students will scan the code using the e-log app and the scanned information will be stored in the database. So, my question is, how can Admin get details (name) about the person who scan the QR code?
I tried to google it but what I found was only people scan the QR code and info will pop-up. I want to know how to get the name of the user who scan the QR cod and view it on a web.
