# Should I use different servers for backend and api provider?

I'm building an app in which I'm using react-js as a frontend. And now I need to provide data from APIs, now my question is should I create a new server for APIs?
Can anybody suggest to me how can I do this?
I'm using Django-restframework to interact with React.
