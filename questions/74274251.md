# How can I interact with Google Maps on iOS using Appium?

I have an native iOS app and it's using a Google Maps. I need to automate tap on a pins on the map, but looks like Appium didn't see them and can't interact with the map.
Google Maps controls all of its content. It is also using Metal to render the map, which may be one of the reasons Appium doesn't see any children

I thought it may be a web context, but it's not.
Maybe somebody knows how can I get the page output for Google Maps or how can I automate it?
