# Host react app on windows server without Internet

I need to set up a commercial project on private windows server.
How to host a react application without internet connection?
In my understanding, I need to build the project locally and copy all dependencies, but still I don't understand how to get it running in the browser? Should I build a script, which will start the project locally on the server using localhost or there is a better way to host it?
It is a micro-frontend app, build with webpack.
