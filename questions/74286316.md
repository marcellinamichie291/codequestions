# Bootstrapped hclust with real data

I have a dataset with multiple observations for each category:

I want to run hierarchical cluster analysis on it in R, such that there are only 4 nodes (corresponding to 4 levels of country). The only way I can think of is to take mean values of the columns (PC1, PC2...) based on country and then run hclust in R. Since I have multiple observations for each categorical variable (there are at least 200 for each level), I want to run a bootstrap version of hierarchical cluster analysis on thousands of sub-samples (by randomly selecting one observation for each categorical variable) and running hclust, and then get a final result. I have come across the following ways of bootstrap clustering. pvclust appears to be useful for the summarised version of this data. ClusterBootstrap and Bclust also do not look useful for my scenario. Any ideas how can I run bootstrap using sub-samples of actual observations instead of using the summarized version with /without replacement?
