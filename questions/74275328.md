# Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined - minio

I am trying to use Minio on my react application. But as soon as I import Minio, I get this error:

I used react-rewired to solve the problem with fs. And then ran into this problem. I've tried various ways, and various answers that others have helped, but none of them answer this problem-
I also tried with webpack.config.js:
resolve: {
        alias: {
            process: "process/browser"
        },
...

and
plugins: [
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            process: 'process/browser'
        }),
...

both of these solutions, but it doesn't help either.

Does anyone have any another solution?
