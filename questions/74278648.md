# Is there a Reactor operator for snapshot + streaming updates pattern

There is a common pattern in finance where a client can subscribe to a "book" of orders by retrieving a snapshot of the current book state and then an ongoing stream of order messages (add/delete/modify) which affect the book state.
To guarantee that no messages are missed one can first subscribe to the ongoing update stream, then retrieve the snapshot, and then apply all the update messages on top of the snapshot. In general some updates will be earlier than the snapshot and these can be made no-ops or discarded, and some later, but there are no gaps and you can end up with a valid and continuously updating view of the book.
I'd like to merge these two streams into one flux request using java reactor, but I can't find an operator or recipe that does what I want:

subscribe to a never-ending update flux and start buffering the messages
subscribe to a snapshot flux and emit all those messages until it completes
replay the buffered update messages; and
emit all subsequent update messages (never-ending)

Merge, concat, etc. don't quite seem to work. Any pointers to an operator or recipe to achieve this?
Thanks.
