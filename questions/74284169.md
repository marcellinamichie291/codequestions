# Android how to start Fragment like Activity launch Mode do

such as Fragment A -> Fragment B -> Fragment C -> Fragment D.
how can i restart Fragment A just like Activity singleTask launch mode.
The way I figure out that Fragment D invoke popBackStack 4 Time And add a New Fragment A to backstack. Using Fragment animation to make it look like back to FragmentA. But it's just a visiual cheating.
And someTime, I don't know how many times I have to popBackStack.
Is there any way to do that without using Jetpack Navigation?
