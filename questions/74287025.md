# Create a Github Action's pipeline to automatically build .NET Core console app and create a Release

I need to create a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions to build a simple console .NET application. The result should be a yaml-file that I can add to my repository.
Specs:

.NET Core 6 or 7
The pipline should be triggered by any commit to master-branch.
After that all NuGet-packages should be restored and a release-build
should start.
When everything is built, the artifacts should be packed in a zip archive with DD.MM.YYYY.zip name.
The archive should be posted to Releases page of the GitHub project.

The project should be built for both Mac OS and Windows x64, so there should be 2 archives for both platforms.
Is it possible to do this type of pipeline using GitHub Actions? If so, could you please provide a yaml-example? I'm stuck on the part of creating archives for build artifacts and posting them to Releases page. Please, helpüôè
