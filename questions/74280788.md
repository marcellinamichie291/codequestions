# DAX - Production by Hour and By Machine

I'm new to DAX and started with a problem of converting an old PDF report created in C# to paginated report on BI.
The data I have is similar to this:
Machine    |  ProductionTimestamp  |  ProductionHour
M1         |  01/01/2022 06:35:12  |    06
M1         |  01/01/2022 09:30:12  |    09
M1         |  01/01/2022 22:55:12  |    22
M2         |  01/01/2022 09:55:12  |    09
M2         |  01/01/2022 22:35:12  |    22
M3         |  01/01/2022 07:35:12  |    07
M3         |  01/01/2022 08:35:12  |    08
I need generate a daily paginated report with this information: hourly production by machine, between 04h and 0h.
Production is the count of ProductionTimestamp in each hour of day.
ProductionHour |  M1   |  M2   |   M3
04             |   0   |  0    |    0
05             |   0   |  0    |    0
06             |   1   |  0    |    0
07             |   0   |  0    |    1
08             |   0   |  0    |    8
09             |   1   |  1    |    0
10             |   0   |  0    |    0
...
22             |   1   |  1    |    0
23             |   0   |  0    |    0
To the moment, I have the hourly production for 1 machine, but I don't know how to go ahead and add a column per machine.
Thanks for any help.

EVALUATE
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS (
'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[HoraProducao],
'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[Maquina_ID],
FILTER (
VALUES ( 'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[DataProducao] ),
'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[DataProducao]
= TODAY () - 1
),
FILTER (
VALUES ( 'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[Maquina_ID] ),
'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[Maquina_ID] = 1
),
"M1", COUNT ( 'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[Data] )
)
ORDER BY 'FACT-ProducaoBanburys'[HoraProducao]
And the result is:
HoraProducao   |  M1
6              |    4
7              |   12
8              |   16
9              |   12
10             |   24
