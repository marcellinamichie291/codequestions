# Building an unencrypted AMI on AWS with packer

I'm building an own AMI which will be share with several other AWS accounts.
Sharing of AMI seems only to be possible if the AMI is not encrypted.
But the default Packer build seems to create an encrypted AMI.
The following setting in the build section of packer.json seems not to help:
"encrypt_boot": false
