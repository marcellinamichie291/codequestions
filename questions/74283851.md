# Unable to SSH into GCP vm - troubleshoot showing no issue

I am unable to ssh into a gcp vm. When i try troubleshooting- it is not showing any issue.

I was able to ssh into other VMs.
FYI i have a Github instance installed into that vm.
this is the firewall config, i tried allowing both http and https- but it did not work.-

How do i proceed to troubleshoot further?
From GCP doc
After an SSH connection fails, you have the option to Retry the connection, or Troubleshoot the connection using the SSH-in-browser troubleshooting tool.
i did troubleshoot but all steps were green.
