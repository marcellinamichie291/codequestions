# @IgnoredOnParcel annotation doesn't work for @Parcelize in Kotlin

I try to ignore a field when using the @Parcelize annotation in Kotlin so I am using @IgnoredOnParcel,
Plz guide me, on how to solve this error
error: Cannot figure out how to save this field into database. You can consider adding a type converter for it.
    private final com.boltuix.mvvm.model.Source source = null;
                 ^

Here is my full source code:

Now i have a plan to recreate the data class, is there any better solution to ignore fields
@Entity(tableName = "favorite_movie")
@Parcelize
data class Article(
    val author: String?,
    val content: String?,
    val description: String?,
    val publishedAt: String?,
    val pagedLists: Source,
    val title: String?,
    val url: String?,
    val urlToImage: String?
): Parcelable {

    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    var id : Int = 0

    @IgnoredOnParcel
    var pagedList: Source = pagedLists

}
