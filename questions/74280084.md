# Tearing my hair out trying to covert an 'object' column consisting of Dates so that I can make a Calendar Heatmap

I am trying to create a Calendar Heatmap looking at a sport team's Attendance by Date.
Sample DF
The Date column is an 'Object' so I tried a very lazy attempt at using "df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])" but I would get the error of "Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 1-04-07 00:00:00".
I've also tried changing the format of 'Thursday, Apr 7' using something along the lines of "strftime('%m,%d,%Y')" but then I would get errors saying something about unable to work on Series.
I am lost in what to do next. I'm hoping someone can assist me in this.
