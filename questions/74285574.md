# # and ^ should not match in this regular expression /([a-zA-Z][^a-zA-Z]*){3,}/ in Javascript

The minimum string length should be 3 and it should not contain # and ^ in the string
I tried with /([a-zA-Z][^a-zA-Z#^]*){3,}/, It's working on https://regexr.com, but its not working all testing tools like https://www.regextester.com .
