# What is the difference between "() => {}" and "delegate{}" in C#?

I was creating a method with a Action parametter, I know that I can pass the action trought both ways and both works well, but I don't know the difference
OnDisabled(() => {object.enabled = false;});
// or
OnDisabled(delegate{object.enabled = false;});

I've done some testes with boths ways but results were always the same.
