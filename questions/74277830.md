^^The text is super long, I'm pretty sure it's code that was encoded, maybe it's .exe so it doesn't show text too well, but I can't figure it out. If you could help, I'd appreciate it a lot^^
I tried Base64, and it didn't show text, maybe it's .exe so it can't convert to text, but I don't know. It's coding, maybe a windows program or something, I don't know. I'm not experienced enough to figure it out. I also tried Base32, 16, 8, and all of those didn't work.
Please don't downvote, just ignore instead
