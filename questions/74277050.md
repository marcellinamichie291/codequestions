# Plotly: n qualitative colors

I am using Plotly and Python 3 for data visualization. It is known to me that default number of colors in Plotly is 10 and are repeated in cycle if more elements than 10.
I do not want to use this approach to bring more colors in my 3D scattegram: How to create discrete colormap with n colors using Plotly cause the colors look too similar.
I am looking for a solution that would assign one unique qualitative color to each element (cluster) in my code.
Here is my code:
fig_tSNE = px.scatter_3d(x = projections[:,0],
                      y = projections[:,1],
                      z = projections[:,2],                  
                      color = to_be_plotted['Cluster'],
                      color_discrete_sequence = px.colors.sequential.PuBu)

Thanks for help.
