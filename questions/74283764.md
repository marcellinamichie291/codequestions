# Show the difference between two averages with ggplot in R

In my dataset I have two columns, named part_1 and part_2, that contain several numerical values.
I am required to create a graph that shows how the average varies in the two parts.
I think that the best way is to create a barplot with a bar for each part, but I'm not sure about it.
First, I created two new columns that contain the mean values for the two parts in each row:
averages <- my_data %>%  mutate(avg_part1=mean(part_1,na.rm=T)) %>%  mutate(avg_part2=mean(part_2,na.rm=T)) 
Then, I inserted the values in two new variables:
avg_part1 <- averages %>% slice(1) %>% pull(avg_part1) avg_part2 <- averages %>% slice(1) %>% pull(avg_part2) 
To create the plot I did:
to_graph<-c("First part"=avg_part1,"Second part"=avg_part2) barplot(to_graph)
And I obtained the graph I wanted, but it's not very nice to see.
I feel like this process is too complex and I may be able to do everything in a couple lines and without creating so many new variables, do you have any suggestions?
Also, I would prefer to create the graph with ggplot because it's better to improve the design, but I don't really know how to do it.
Thanks!
