I have to create unit tests for some complex and long methods and I wanted to name each unit tests following the naming specified as a best practice here :

The name of your test should consist of three parts:
The name of the method being tested.
The scenario under which it's being tested.
The expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.

The problem is that because of the complexity of the method under test, the scenario part is very long, so a unit test can have a very long name.
What should be an appropriate naming convention in this case and how can be described the scenario that is tested?
