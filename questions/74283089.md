# What are some guidelines to decide how much coverage to have for visual screenshots?

Say you have a button with multiple props and you want to make sure the height is consistent through all permutations (border and w/t vs icon and w/t vs 3 different scales, and more). Would you anally insist on coverage for every instance or do you at some point say ok that’s enough screenshots already, we’ve got the gist of it.
I tried literal coverage of every instance and it feels excessive even though I can see how some variations can independently fail if not checked. Still, seems counterproductive.
