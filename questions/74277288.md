# NEAR Lake Indexer - Stuck on "#9820210 - Waiting for peers"

So I was trying to use the Near Lake Indexer but after completing every step, when I ran
./target/release/near-lake --home ~/.near/mainnet run --endpoint https://my-endpoint  --bucket my-bucket --region us-east-1 --stream-while-syncing sync-from-latest

there is nothing other than
INFO stats: # 9820210 Waiting for peers 0 peers ⬇ 0 B/s ⬆ 0 B/s 0.00 bps 0 gas/s CPU: 0%, Mem: 32.8 MB

Why is it trying to fetch block 9820210 but not the latest one, even though I passed in "sync-from-latest"?
