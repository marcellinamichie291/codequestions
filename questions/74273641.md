# How to set the width of each cell in a row as a ratio of the overall table width?

The following table needs to be processed by the appended code. The issues I have are

How to set the width of the three cells in the first row to be 20, 70, and 10% in order?

I try to make the cells in rows 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11 have the same width, but the approach of using CellsRange.Cells.PreferredWidth = 100 / 4 doesn't work for the sixth row.

Also, when I run the code multiple times, the output (some cells width) changes a bit with each run, which I don't know what makes it happen.


So, how to fix the code to address the previous issues?
