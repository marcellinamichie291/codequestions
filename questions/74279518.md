# Redirect to ExpressJs route from React with Axios request

I'm actually working on an App Project and I encountered a problem. First, let me explain what I'm trying to do. When the user is connected to the App he can connect to services ( ex: google ).
Before adding the user system with jwt verification, with only a simple <href> and a callback in the querry it was working well.
Now the routes are secured so I need to pass a header to the server and still redirect the user to the service's auth ( i'm using passport ).
And there is the problem, I tried a lot of things to make this work but i canno't find the solution.
This is my request function :
    const ServiceConnection = () => {
        axios.get("url" + "?callback=callbackurl",
            { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("jwt"))} })
        .then(res => {
            console.log(res)
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        })
    }

With this function i'm having the Access to XMLHttpRequest error.

So I tried to add a lot of things like redirect: "manual" between the url and the header but the problem is that the backend doesn't receive the header anymore but there is no more XMLHttpRequest error.
So if you have any idea, thank you in advance for your help.
