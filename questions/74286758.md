# why I got The method 'add' isn't defined for the type 'Stream' with flutter?

I'm on creating a mobile application with flutter for communicating devices via bluetooth.
Actually I have some data to send from my application to the other device, and then, this device have to send for me a list of ints. after recieving this list I have to set it to empty or add to it another value like 0 to change its value but this didn't work for me. I got always  The method 'add' isn't defined for the type 'Stream'.
this is my code :
   _characteristic42?.value.add(0);

this is another attempt :
       _characteristic42?.value.listen((ev) async => {
                          ev.add(0),
                        });

however the second method didn't work also.
I would be very thankful if you can help me.
