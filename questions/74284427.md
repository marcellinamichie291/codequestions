# Create a regular expression pattern to match all lines that don't contain form

I want to create a regular expression to match all lines that don't contain "form."
For example, for the below
form.id
    </div>
form-group
      <label for="url">URL</label>
form.url
    </div>

I tried to use look ahead, but it doesn't work.
The patter I use is
^.*(?!form\.).*$

This actually matched all lines including those lines like form.id
