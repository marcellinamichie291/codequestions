I am new to machine learning and while training a model using sklearn i am getting this error. please help me. I am getting an error "ValueError: The least populated class in y has only 1 member, which is too few. The minimum number of groups for any class cannot be less than 2."
MY CODE IS AS FOLLOWS:-
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


dataset_dt= pd.read_csv("mobiles.csv")

from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
a=StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1,test_size=0.2,random_state=42)
for str_train_set_index,str_test_set_index in a.split(dataset_dt,dataset_dt["Original Price"]):
    str_train_set=dataset_dt.loc[str_train_set_index]
    str_test_set=dataset_dt.loc[str_test_set_index]

print(str_train_set['Original Price'].value_counts())
print(str_test_set['Original Price'].value_counts())


Traceback (most recent call last):
