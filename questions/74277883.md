# How to set First broker login to Keycloak token exchanging client?

I have a Keycloak client that exchange Google access token to Keycloak token via http request to /auth/realms/REALM/protocol/openid-connect/token. This client linked to Google idp, but by default uses other authentication flow. When the token is exchanged for the first time, a new user is also registered. I need to apply custom First broker login to register a new user or special SPI on this client.
I can't find in console where i can do it. It is possible?
