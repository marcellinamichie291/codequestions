# Finding document with regex but the input is array

I am trying to find solution for findig document with array search input. Solution on next line is working great, but i need to do more complex search.
const searchInput = ["United States","Mexico"]  
model.find({country: { $in: searchInput },})

The data has "country" field in various forms and for that reason i need to use regex. For which the following solution works if only one country is searched.
model.find({country : {$regex : "United States"}});

But I need to combine the previous two solutions. Do I need to do a separate search for each element in the array, or is there a better solution?
Example data:

0: {country: "United States"}
1: {country: "Mexico"}
2: {country: "Canada"}
3: {country: "United States | Canada"}

From these documents, I want to find only those that match the search equals ["United States","Mexico"].
Expected results:

0: {country: "United States"}
1: {country: "Mexico"}
3: {country: "United States | Canada"}

Thank you for any help
