# "blockade" a include which is added through if condition in a specific page

I have an if condition that adds a header using the include in my pages if the user is logged in and another header if he is not logged in.
It works fine, but I ran into a problem...
On the login page for example, I wouldn't like the header to appear, but the if adds to all my pages.
Is there any way I can "block" pages that I don't want the header/include added?
(I don't speak English fluently, sorry if there are any grammar mistakes)
code:
if ($this->session->userdata('user_login')) {
    include 'logged_in_header.php';
}else {
    include 'logged_out_header.php';
}

I already tried to remove using javascript, but it would be better if not even add
