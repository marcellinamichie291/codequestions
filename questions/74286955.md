# Rails 7 style upload and hide submit button

In my Rails 7 app I'm building file upload mechanism. I want to display to the user button Upload after which he will have the opportunity to select files. According to the docs I should use form_with helper which I did:
<%= form_with url: kyc_document_upload_path, multipart: true do |f| %>
  <label class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm">
    Upload
      <%= f.file_field :picture, multiple: true, name: 'picture' %>
  </label>
  <%= f.submit 'Submit', class: 'btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm' %>
<% end %>

Which give me:

How to replace Choose files button by Upload and display submit only after some file was chosen?
I know I could do something like:
    <span style="display:none;">
      <%= f.file_field :picture, multiple: true, name: 'picture' %>
    </span>

But then there will be no information about the selected files.
