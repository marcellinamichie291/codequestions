# Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation does not permit: While starting MarkLogic within Docker Container

I am trying to start an application - MarkLogic from a bash script.
I am using below bash script-
service /etc/init.d/MarkLogic start

And I am getting below error -
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start etc-init.d-MarkLogic.mount
Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation not permitted

The bash script is running inside a Docker container.
What would be the correct bash command to start the application.
