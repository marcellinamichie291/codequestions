# Conditional formatting between two values

Hi sorry I just really need some answer for this question. I'm only using my phone.
In the first pic is the simple conditional formatting that I use. Cell value with specific text
But in picture #2 is what I would like to happen. Even in the blank between there would be a color. Not sure if this is possible but I would like to hear from you guys.
Thank you.
