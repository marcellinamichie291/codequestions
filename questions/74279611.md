# How to define global hooks in TestCafe using TypeScript?

In documentation it is mentioned to use js configuration file in order to define a global hook, however there is no such option for ts configuration file which makes it difficult if not impossible to combine my previously created classes/code.
So my question is, how do I create a global hook in js configuration file that can use my ts classes?
