# Configure wxwidgets with Codeblocks

I want to build C++ GUI programs using Codeblocks+Wxwidgets+cmake. I tried to configure Wxwidgets with codeblocks IDE following the instructions given in the wxWidgets Discussion Forum as well as other Youtube tutorials.
I followed the youtube tutorials below.

But, when 'DEBUG' and 'RELEASE' are being built, it keeps showing some kind of errors. As a result, the building was failed.

Please help me to solve this or suggest another easy way to do C++ GUI projects.
Thank you!
