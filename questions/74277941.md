# How to call Multiple API calls asynchronously in React with headers?

I need to call two APIs within the same component to render all of the information I need, but I called the first API in an asynchronous way and I am having trouble adding in a second API call in a similar way...
Here is what I have so far:

Component.tsx

import * as React from "react";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { getCookie } from "../utils/cookies";
import axios from "axios";
import List from "./List";

 export default function Users() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const JWT = await getCookie("auth");
      const { data } = await axios(
        "/api/userBasicInfo", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          Authorization: JWT,
        },
      });

      setData(data);
      setIsLoading(false);
    } catch (e) {
      setIsLoading(false);
      alert("error fetching data");
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

     return (
         <div>
            <List data={data} />
         </div>
     )
 }

Ideally, I'd like to add in the following API call right after the first one

Second api call

const { detailedData } = await axios(
        "/api/userDetailedInfo", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          Authorization: JWT,
        },
      });

Am I able to keep this same async syntax and add in another axios call, or is that not possible when making multiple axios calls? Am I going to need another useState hook to deal with the 2nd API's data? Will I need to add in the second call into the useEffect hook? The confusing part for me is dealing with the headers...
