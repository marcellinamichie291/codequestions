# FittedBox with single emoji in text not showing up

My beloved ðŸ¦¦ is not showing up. It used to though, with Flutter 3.0.0.
Now, using Flutter 3.3.6 Dart SDK 2.18.2, it does not.
Does anyone know if it's a bug? Or does anyone know a workaround for auto-scaling?
Minimal example:
class OtterFreakshow extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return 
      Column(children: [
        // works as expected with single letters
        Container(
      color: Colors.green,
      width:200, height: 200 ,child: const FittedBox(child: Text('A'))),
              
        // works as expected for emoji with surrounding letters
                Container(color: Colors.purple,
      width:200, height: 200 ,child: const FittedBox(child: Text('_ðŸ¦¦_'))),
        
        // not rendering correctly (invisible!) without some letters surrounding the otter
        Container(color: Colors.red,
      width:200, height: 200 ,child: const FittedBox(child: Text('ðŸ¦¦')))
      
      
      ]);
    }}

yields:

Interestingly, with surrounding blankspaces, the emoji also does not show up.
