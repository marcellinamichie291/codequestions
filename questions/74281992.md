# Using relative and absolute links not working despite files being in correct directory [PHP site]

I have a site that previously worked however after moving it over to GoDaddy shared hosting, links from the homepage no longer work. The homepage works perfectly however the links from the homepage (index.php) results in a 404 ERROR.
I'm using relative links. The file structure hasn't changed and I'm unable to path directly to the file (for example, if I put in the URL www.domain.com/[file path] a 404 error is returned.
Is there a setting that needs to be changed/added from the cPanel control or htaccess?
I tried updating the .htaccess file but it doesn't seem to work

My Index file reads:
 <?php

session_name("examplecookie");
session_set_cookie_params(0, '/', '.example.com');
session_save_path('/home/GODADDYSERVER/_session');
ini_set('session.gc_probability', 1);
session_start();
 

$dateNow = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone('America/Chicago'));
$statsDate = $dateNow->format("Y-m-d");

define("TIME", time());

include("includes/php/functions.php");

include("includes/php/class.Ad.php");
include("includes/php/class.CategoryList.php");

$control = ObjectManager::load_Controller();
$control->start();


$control->cleanup();
?>

Should these be the files I look at?
