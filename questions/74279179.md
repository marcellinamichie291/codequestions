# Convert a particular JSON element to integer using javascript

I am bit new to javascript and I want to change a particular JSON element to string without changing the whole JSON.
Input:
   {
       "Response" : {
          "Data" : {
             "Type" : "Set",
             "Serial" : "75798"
          }
       }
    }

The output I wanted is:
{
   "Response" : {
      "Data" : {
         "Type" : "Set",
         "Serial" : 75798
      }
   }
}

Got to know about parseInt function but not sure how to write the full code where I get the output as above after it processed by the javascript.
