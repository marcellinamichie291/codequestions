# numpy standard deviation does not give the same result as scipy stats standard deviation

Scipy and numpy standard deviation methods give slightly different results. I don't understand why. Can anyone explain that to me?
Here is an example.
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats
ar = np.arange(20)
print(np.std(ar))
print(scipy.stats.tstd(ar))

returns
5.766281297335398
5.916079783099616
