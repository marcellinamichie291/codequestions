# Python Ed448 elliptic encryption

I have found edwards448 aka Ed448 here as a secure elliptic encryption method.
In python, I have such a simple code for RSA encryption
import rsa
public_key, private_key = rsa.newkeys(2048)
plain_text = "This is my secret message".encode('utf8')
cipher_text = rsa.encrypt(plain_text, public_key)
decrypted_message = rsa.decrypt(cipher_text, private_key)

What I can find in the online documentation is just about signing a message. But, how should I can I use Ed448 for encryption of plain_text?
I am not after any symmetric encryption or key exchange. I want to do Ed448 asymmetric encryption/decryption regardless of how much practical it is.
