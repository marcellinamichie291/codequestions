# "UnknownError" creating a Booking through the Microsoft Graph Bookings API?

I'm trying to use the "Booking Business" endpoint in Microsoft Bookings through the graph API, but the documentation is not very clear on how to get it working. I am authenticating correctly, and everything appears to work, but I can't seem to actually trigger appointment creation and I can't find any way to get more meaningful feedback on why my requests are failing.
The core request I am sending looks like this:
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/solutions/bookingBusinesses/MyCalendar@MyOrg.com/appointments
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.bookingAppointment",
    "serviceId": "a98309e9-3104-411f-q681-71c7df95a178",
    "duration": "PT30M",
    "start_date_time":
    {
        "dateTime": "2022-12-22T14:30:00+00:00",
        "timeZone": "UTC"
    },
    "staffMemberIds":
    [
        "e220feb5-5bc-43c6-922z-a2cd5a545ec2"
    ],
    "isLocationOnline": true,
    "filedAttendeeCount": 1,
    "reminders@odata.type": "#Collection(microsoft.graph.bookingReminder)",
    "reminders":
    [
        {
            "message": "Remember your important appointment today",
            "offset": "PT120M",
            "recipients": "allAttendees"
        }
    ],
    "customers":
    [
        {
            "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.bookingCustomerInformation",
            "name": "Barrington Visitor",
            "emailAddress": "visitor@visitor-organisation.org"
        }
    ]
}


This brings a response that looks like this:
{
 "error":{
   "code": "UnknownError",
   "message": "",
   "innerError":{
      "date": "2022-11-01T15:27:06",
      "request-id": "72e0b067-6347-4cb9-9257-04db4765908a",
      "client-request-id": "72e0e061-6347-4cb9-9127-0fdb47a590aa"
   }
  }
}


I have found two known causes of bugs here - if one doesn't include the @odata.type on the customer section that will raise an InvalidModel error with the message changes: Cannot create an abstract class. Apparently on other endpoints using a timezone other than UTC causes the same UnknownError message to be raised, but I have switched all my timezones to UTC so I'm hoping that will do the trick.
When I look at the request-id in the AAD portal it just shows a successful authentication, no mention of errors being raised subsequently.
Obviously that request is far more minimal than the example in the documentation, so I have gradually gone through and added more and more from the object, even ones that seem to be completely unnecessary. Even when the request looks like this, I get the same response:

}


Unfortunately, in spite of having all the properties that the documentation example includes, except some of the address fields are null and there is no location associated with the customer as I'd have to fabricate one. In both cases adding the fields in question do not resolve the issue.
Has anyone found a way to resolve or even usefully troubleshoot this "UnknownError" message? Alternatively, is there something wrong with my requests that I have missed and would avoid it?
