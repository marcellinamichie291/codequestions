Is it possible to take all the content in a body element, and place it inside a div?
Below is an example, although I do not want to simply add the content of the body, I want to add it inside a div. I am relatively new, so I apologize if my question is unclear and my limited knowledge on what methods to use.
let innards = document.body.innerHTML;
document.body.innerHTML += innards;

I attempted to add the innerHTML to a div, but it does not seem to work in the same manner. Is there a way to extract the innerHTML?
