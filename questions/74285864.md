# Create new array then splice a string into each, then forEach before MySQL INSERT

I'm struggling with an array issue. I have a React frontend posting an array to a node API for a MySQL INSERT query. The data from frontend consists of an array with 1 object and 6 elements. One of these elements is an array itself.
[
  {
    subjectID: '2',
    studentList: [ [Object], [Object] ],
    subjectTitle: 'Physics',
    subjectLevel: 'IGCSE Level',
    syllabusCode: '0625',
    subjectGroup: 'Humanities'
  }
]

The studentList array:
[ { studentID: '244' }, { studentID: '245' } ]

What I'm trying to achieve is a new array with objects unique to each studentID, so I can run a forEach over it just before . End result looking something like this:
[
  {
    subjectID: "2",
    studentID: "244",
    subjectTitle: "Physics",
    subjectLevel: "IGCSE Level",
    syllabusCode: "0625",
    subjectGroup: "Humanities",
  },
  {
    subjectID: "2",
    studentID: "245",
    subjectTitle: "Physics",
    subjectLevel: "IGCSE Level",
    syllabusCode: "0625",
    subjectGroup: "Humanities",
  },
];

I'm not sure at which point splice will come into it...
Please let me know if I can supply any other code. I'd appreciate any guidance/assistance! (Been coding for about 2 months now)
