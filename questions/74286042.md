# adding pcapplusplus to cmake

I installed pcapplusplus using brew on ubuntu 20.04:
brew install pcapplusplus

and added to CMakeLists.txt:
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar")
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew")
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib")
find_package(pcapplusplus REQUIRED)

However this gives me the package not found error:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:53 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpcapplusplus.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "pcapplusplus", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcapplusplus" with
  any of the following names:

    pcapplusplusConfig.cmake
    pcapplusplus-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pcapplusplus" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pcapplusplus_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pcapplusplus" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

EDIT:
in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar, I have:
binutils   gcc   ...   pcapplusplus ...

and
Any solution would be much appreciated!
