# Working out a column value based on another column as a percentage value

I am trying to create a new column which is a calculation between 2 other columns in my df, one column if a value and the other column if the % of the first column i wish to appear in my new column. Should be a bit easier to explain with my data;
df
   Country_Name           gdp_per_capita    Agriculture_GDP% 

 1 Albania                         3281.               20.6                          
 2 Algeria                         3515.               9.86                                     
 3 Bosnia and Herzegovina          3828.               8.21                                     
 4 Croatia                        11285.               3.90                                     
 5 Cyprus                         24686.               2.60

So I want to create a new column with the value for Albania to be 20.6% of 3281 here which would be 675.8
I had an attempt at this my dividing the 1st column by the second but it gave me some wrong results;
df$gdp_per_capita_agg_percen = df$gdp_per_capita/bar_df$Agriculture_GDP%
