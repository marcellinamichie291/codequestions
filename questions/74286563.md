# Pair-Wise coverage, how to generate test cases?

My homework says that for a group of 3 blocks
[A, B]; [1, 2, 3]; [x, y]
that it will create 8 potential edge-pair coverage (A, 1, x), (A, 2, x), (A, 3, x), (A, -, x), (B, 1, y), (B, 2, y), (B, 3, y), (B, -, x) where - means any block can be used.
I'm confused on how it is 8 choices and where 8 came from - I thought it would generate 3 * 2 (or 6 test cases) or how to create test cases in the first place. Since there are multiple different groups, I'm not sure how that test generation happens
