# Lua String Data to Table

I am trying to parse String Data to Lua Table. Tried a few Lua string Library functions but had no luck.
The String Data Returned from the server looks like this
E000: Success
AOS               1.5.1.1
Switched Rack PDU 1.2.0.2 
Model:            abc3245
Name:             Test Device
Location:         Unknown
Contact:          Unknown
Present Outlets:  16
Switched Outlets: 16
Metered Outlets:  0
Max Current:      32 A A
Present Phases:   1
Metered Phases:   1
Metered Banks:    2
Uptime:           1 Day 9 Hours 22 Minutes
Network Link:     Link Active

I am trying to achieve Table Key Value Pair like
DataTable = {["E000"]= "Sucess",["AOS"]= "1.5.1.1"}

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
