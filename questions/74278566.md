# Managing user level customizations to a run configuration stored as a project file

In my java project, we have a Intellij IDEA run configuration stored as a project file, which is tracked in VCS.
But, there can be user level customizations to this run config by each user, which they have to keep as a local change in the VCS, which they should omit from their regular commits.
Is there a way to manage the local customizations to the run config without having to keep a local change in VCS, for an example in a user level override file which is ignored in VCS?
