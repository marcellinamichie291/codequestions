# wait until insertAdjacentHTML is done then continue code

I dynamically add content to my web page using insertAdjacentHTML like the following example code:
...
for(let i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++)
{
    someDiv.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `<div id='post-${i}'>...</div>`);

    let insertedObject = document.getElementById(`post-${i}`);
    // at this point `insertedObject` is null!
}
...

but content does not get added instantly and insertedObject is null, now I have tried finding fixes and the most common is to put a setTimeout to wait until the new element is added but thats too slow! could there be a better way to get the newly added element?
