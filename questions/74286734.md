# How to Show 30 days in Day View with Horizontal Scrollbar in Dhtmlx Scheduler?

I want to show 30 days in Day View Scheduler with Horizontal Scrollbar. Currently, Horizontal Scrollbar is available only for Timeline View but I want it for Day View as well as Month View.
For Timeline View with Horizontal Scrollbar code:
scheduler.createTimelineView({
name: "timeline",
x_unit: "minute",
x_date: "%H:%i",
x_step: 30,
x_size: 24*7,
x_start: 16,
x_length: 48,
y_unit: sections,
y_property: "section_id",
render: "bar",
scrollable: true,  
column_width: 70, 
scroll_position:new Date(2018, 0, 15)   });

Please share your ideas and Sample links
Thanks in Advance
