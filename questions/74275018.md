# My html parser is not showing the entire HTML code that actually runs behind the webpage when I inspect the HTML code. Here's my code:

`
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
import html5lib
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r'D:\Web Scraping\chromedriver.exe')

url = "https://ibegin.tcs.com/iBegin/jobs/search"

req = driver.get(url)

soup = bs(driver.page_source, 'html.parser')

results = soup.find('body', {'id' : 'app-body', 'data-country' : 'IN'}).prettify()

print(soup.find('div', {'class' : 'row custom-row searched-job ng-scope'}))

`


I have tried finding the div tags hierarchically after the body tag. Still I am getting an empty list as output after this point. What have I been doing wrong?
