# Clockwork Laravel not working when start app with command 'php -S 172.17.48.1:8003 -t public'

I have multiple microservices in Laravel and Lumen.
The service that developed in Laravel runs clockwork in local environment with php artisan serve command.
But same service deploy on EC2 AWS and it's not working. Errors screenshot attached.
What I observe that in production it does not run with php artisan serve command.
Another Lumen service also does not working with clockwork  even on Local environment. This lumen service run with php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public command.
