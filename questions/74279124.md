# UseQueryWithStore works but useGetList does not

I have a component that fetches a list of items from the data provider like this:
  const { data, total, loading, loaded, error, refetch } = useQueryWithStore({
    type: 'getList',
    resource: 'client/account',
    payload: {
      pagination: {
        page: page + 1,
        perPage: rowsPerPage,
      },
      sort: {
        order: sortOrder,
        field: sortBy,
      },
    },
  })

  if (!loaded) {
    return <Loading />
  }
  if (error) {
    return <p>ERROR</p>
  }
 // render data

Everything works and I can render the list of data in a table.
Now, I wanted to use useGetList specialized hook with this code:
 const { data, total, ids, loading, loaded, error, refetch } = useGetList<ClientAccount>(
    'client/account',
    {
      page: page + 1,
      perPage: rowsPerPage,
    },
    {
      order: sortOrder,
      field: sortBy,
    }
  )

  if (loading) {
    return <Loading />
  }
  if (error) {
    return <p>ERROR</p>
  }
// render

It successfully calls the data provider as it would with useQueryWithStore, it gets the data back from the API, but then all the fields just do not get the fetched data:

total is undefined
data is an empty object
ids is an empty list
loaded is true
loading is false

I'm using react-admin version 3.14.
What do I do wrong? Should this behave similarly?
Edit:
When I inspect the redux actions in Redux DevTools I can see that everything worked properly. It dispatched the following actions:

CUSTOM_QUERY
CUSTOM_QUERY_LOADING
RA/FETCH_START
CUSTOM_QUERY_SUCCESS
RA/FETCH_END

And for the CUSTOM_QUERY_SUCCESS I see the following output:
{"type":"GET_LIST","resource":"client/account","payload":{"pagination":{"page":1,"perPage":20},"sort":{"order":"desc","field":"id"},"filter":{}}}(pin):{data:[{id:'e57â€¦1987}
But still, I don't get any data in the destructuring of the useGetList hook.
