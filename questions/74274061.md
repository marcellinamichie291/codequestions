# couldn't connect laravel with Postgresql

I'm trying to connect laravel project with postgreSQL in localhost.
I already installed postgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 on windows and create a database
then trying to connect with my laravel project after I defined a new connection in config/database.php
with these configuration
'pgsql' => [
    'driver' => 'pgsql',
    'url' => env('DATABASE_URL'),
    'host' => 'localhost', 
    'port' => '5432', 
    'database' => 'MyDatabaseName', 
    'username' => 'postgres', 
    'password' => 'MyUserPassword', 
    'charset' => 'utf8',
    'prefix' => '',
    'prefix_indexes' => true,
    'search_path' => 'public',
    'sslmode' => 'prefer',
],

but it returns this error when running the project
SQLSTATE[08006] [7] could not connect to server: Connection refused (0x0000274D/10061) Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432? FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"

Even though I entered the correct password !
