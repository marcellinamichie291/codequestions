I am developing an android application and want to create an instruction mechanism for every page, directing users to click a specific button.
How can I create such dialogs indicating, highlighting a button that has to be clicked, also the button should be highlighted and background is darkened to focus a user's attention.
I created a simple alert dialog, but it's not what I am looking for
