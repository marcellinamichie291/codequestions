# Efficiently find nearest dictionary key

I have a bunch of pairs of dates and monetary values in a SortedDictionary<DateTime, decimal>, corresponding to loan balances calculated into the future at contract-defined compounding dates. Is there an efficient way to find a date key that is nearest to a given value? (Specifically, the nearest key less than or equal to the target). The point is to store only the data at the points when the value changed, but efficiently answer the question "what was the balance on x date?" for any date in range.
A similar question was asked ( What .NET dictionary supports a "find nearest key" operation? ) and the answer was "no" at the time, at least from the people who responded, but that was almost 3 years ago. 
The question How to find point between two keys in sorted dictionary presents the obvious solution of naively iterating through all keys. I am wondering if any built-in framework function exists to take advantage of the fact that the keys are already indexed and sorted in memory -- or alternatively a built-in Framework collection class that would lend itself better to this kind of query.
