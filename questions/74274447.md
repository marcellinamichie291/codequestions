# Firestore method is not being recognised

addProduct = async () => {
      await firestore()
      .collection('products')
      .doc('panadol')
      .add({
        expiry: '12/23/22',
        activeIngredient:'paracetemol',
      })
      
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Medication added!');
      });
  }

In my code, I have a method called add item in my Scan.js and in that method i have used firestore.collection and .add. I have called this function in a touchable opacity so when i run my code and try and click the button, it throws me this, Scan.js:66 Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: firestore is not defined and Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined 
I tried to update the version of firestore to 9.0.0 but it didn't work. The outcome of my app should be that when I press the done button, it should make a connection with my database and add a value in that field.
