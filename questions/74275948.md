# How to add iOS 13.3 simulator to XCode 14.0.1 on MacOs 13 Ventura?

everyone.
I am having trouble finding the iOS 13.3 simulator on XCode after I updated my MacOS Version to 13.0 Ventura. The lowest available version to download is iOS 13.7, I need
anything at 13.3 or lower. Furthermore, looking through older posts about simulators missing. They all state that downloading simulators can be achieved by going to Preferences > Components, which my XCode does not have. Preferences seems to be renamed to Settings and there is no Components tab anywhere in the settings.
Any suggestions on how to get this done?
Thank you.
