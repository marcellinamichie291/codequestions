# Jfrog artifactory download an entire repo

I have been trying to download an entire repo in the Jfrog artifactory using curl as below but don't see an error nor the file downloaded. Is there any better way to download the entire repo from the artifactory service ?
curl -u user:pwd -X GET http://artifactory/local-repo/path/to/folder?archiveType=zip
