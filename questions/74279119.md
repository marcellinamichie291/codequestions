comboList = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8],[0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[0,4,8],[2,4,6]]
#duplicate values wont be entered into these test lists to begin with so idc about that
testList1 = [0,1,2]
testList2 = [1,2,4,7] 
testList3 = [0,2,3,6,5,69,4,6,1]
testList4 = [2,1,3] #this needs to return false

def testfunc(mainList, sublist):#This is the trash func
    for list in mainList: 
        y1 = 0
        x1 = 0
        while x1 < len(sublist):
            if sublist[x1] in list:
                y1 = y1 + 1
                if y1 == 3:
                    return True
            x1 = x1 + 1
    return False

if testfunc(comboList,testList1):
    print("Test1 Pass")
else:
    print("Test1 Fail")

if testfunc(comboList,testList2):
    print("Test2 Pass")
else:
    print("Test2 Fail")

if testfunc(comboList,testList3):
    print("Test3 Pass")
else:
    print("Test3 Fail")

if testfunc(comboList,testList4):
    print("Test4 Fail")
else:
    print("Test4 Pass")

I am fairly new to to this and I would like some feedback on how to write this more elegantly, this function is currently doing exactly what I want it to do but there should be a better way of doing it especially in python.
