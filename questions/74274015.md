# Why is my variables template loaded, but not in steps template? (shown in images)

Can someone tell me why my variables template is loaded in 1 (image), one of the variables shown in 2 (image), but not useable in my template anymore?
I tried following MS docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops#job-stage-and-step-templates-with-parameters
