# Sharepoint Board missing fields! Cannot even add them via JSON

I have a sharepoint list with many fields and several views.
When I try to customise the Board view, not all fields appear.
When I try to add them via JSON, their values do not appear.
(Actually they appeared initially in the preview, but since I Saved, they disappeared and never appeared again, neither in preview nor when visiting the board...)
The fields I am trying to show now are Integer, but there are other fields of different types that are not 'available' to add to the Board.
I really need this, Ihave spent days on it and I am getting desparate...please help!
How can I show these fields in the cards of the board view?
