# Plot several Empirical autocorrelation function in one plot in R

I am trying to plot several empirical autocorrelation in R, but I end up with one plot, another problem is to define this function in R:
{X_t= log (Pt/Pt-1)= mu + sigma (W(t)-w(t-1))}
so I can calculate X_t,|x|^d, d = 1/2, 1, 2.

when I used autocorrelation function, I only got one one plot, but I need to have several plots in one figure. I used the following code:
( head (DM), head(DM [ ,2]), x= head(DM [ ,2]), abc = function (x) { n=length, y= rep(0,n-1), rv = rep(0,n-1) for (i in : 1:n) } for (i in 1:n-1){ y[i] = log(x[i]+x[i +1]} a = acf (Y, lag.max= 60)
