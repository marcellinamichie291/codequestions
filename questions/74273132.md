# How to SELECT from MySQL server using difference?

Let's take a value :
$weight = 50

In database, I have 4 peoples name. Their weight is 40,50,35,54 respectively. I want to take those peoples name whose weight isn't more than $weight+10 and less than $weight-10. Is there any direct way to run it in SQL? Or should I apply logic here?
$query = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM `users`");

$array = array();

while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($query)) {
       if($row['weight']<$weight+10 AND $row['weight']>$weight-10){
           $name = $row['name'];
           $weight = $row['weight'];
       }
}

I am expecting shorter code like instead of applying logic in PHP, just call those data whose weight is not more than 60 and not less than 40
