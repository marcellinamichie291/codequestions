# Find decimal values from a file then split them into addition

Given a file consisting of integers and floats like:
3.0
2
4.222
5.123123

I want to extract the floats and split them into an addition of two parts and print to stdout.
3.0 --> 3 + 0.0 = 3.0 

The part I'm struggling with is catching the floats into my regular expression.
What I have so far:
#!/bin/bash

filename=$1

valid="[0-9]\.[0-9]"
while read line; do
        if [[ "$line" =~ ["$valid"] ]]; then
        var1=`echo $line | cut -f1 -d'.'`
        var2=0.`echo $line | cut -f2 -d'.'`
        echo "$var1 + $var2 = $line"

        fi
        
done < "$filename"



My if [[ $line =~ $valid ]] line does not seem to be working. Looking for a better regex to capture the decimal numbers in the file.
