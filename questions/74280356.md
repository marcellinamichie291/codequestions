# working out the percent change compared to the first value of columns in a data frame

This is for python. I have the following data frame
Symbols          AAPL       MSFT       AMZN       TSLA      GOOGL  ...        Date                                                               ... 2018-01-02  41.310070  82.004974  59.450500  21.368668  53.660500  ...    2018-01-03  41.302879  82.386620  60.209999  21.150000  54.576000  ...    2018-01-04  41.494736  83.111740  60.479500  20.974667  54.787998  ...    2018-01-05  41.967163  84.142174  61.457001  21.105333  55.514500  ...    2018-01-08  41.811283  84.228027  62.343498  22.427334  55.710499  ...    ...               ...        ...        ...        ...        ...  ...
For each column I want to replace the value with the percent change from the first value. So for the AAPL column i would have :
Nan
41.302879/41.310070
41.494736/41.310070
...
.pct_change() doesn't quite give me what i want because it calculates the pct change from one value to the next.
