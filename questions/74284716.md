# typescript expected 1 args but got 2 error

I am trying to write a method with non-mandatory 2nd field like below
  export function getType(_state: StoredState, requiredType?: object) {

  }

The calling method is below,
  getType(state, {includeExp: true});

Getting Expected 1 arguments, but got 2.
Here requiredType is not mandatory one
