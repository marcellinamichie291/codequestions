# Why is my alignment file not readable in R?

Trying to read in file and assign it to a variable but I get the following error:

Error in read.alignment("PrimateAlign1_Lab4.1.txt", format = "fasta") :  File PrimateAlign1_Lab4.1.txt is not readable 2. stop(paste("File", file, "is not readable")) >1. read.alignment("PrimateAlign1_Lab4.1.txt", format = "fasta")

I'm using the seqinr package in R
I've tried getwd() and the file is in the directory. I'm unsure if maybe it has something to do with not having permissions to access the file, however I was able to read in other files.
