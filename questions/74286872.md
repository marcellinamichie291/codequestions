# serve same response just change url

I am using React with webpack and Nodejs. Now when this is hit on network tab http://localhost:8080/abc.js after clicking a button then the abc.js file gets downloaded.
Now I want to change the url still server the abc.js file.
Example after clicking the same button abc.js file will get downloaded but now the url would be like http://localhost:8080/abc.js/checking
I tried this:
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    if(req.path = '/abc.js')
      req.path = req.url = '/check';
    return next();
});

But its not working. What would be the correct aproach.
