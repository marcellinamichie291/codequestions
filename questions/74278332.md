# Can i print user orders use mertics in laravel nova 4?

I have two resources - users and orders. Need to print card metrics to display on user page how many orders make user per day or month. I can find such option in nova docmentation
public function calculate(NovaRequest $request)
{
    return $this->count($request, Order::class);
}

Code like this work. Bat print all orders on all users. I want to specify to single user. And put card in user details page. When i load specific user, i want to count only this user orders.
