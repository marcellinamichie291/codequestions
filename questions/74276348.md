# Critical vulnerability - Prevent azure ad authorization using algorithm none

We are using Azure Ad authorization in .NET 6.0.
Got critical vulnerability where algorithm type cannot be null.
Here's the guide which explains why this is critical vulnerability(Shout out to the author for detailed explanation)
This is our implementation:
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(configuration); 


    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

All the references, we come across is asking to validate the signature.
Now we don't use any secret key Or cert to validate the signature by generating a random HSA OR RSA keys.
Kind of stuck with this vulnerability.
