# Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *" doesn't support the In-App Purchase capability

I am trying to add an in-app purchase to iOS, I am getting an error. If I remove the in-app purchase from capability. Then I get no errors. How can I solve this?
And the identifier I am using is mine. In the first error, I am getting that the identifier is not available.
