# Prevent react app from setting state again when pressed back button

I am building a Simple React App and I am using api to set state and I am using Link to get into detail page But When I go into another page from Link and press back button then It is setting state again. But I am trying to prevent setting state again when I go back to the page from back button.
App.js
function MainPage() {
    const [blogs, setBlogs] = useStae([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        axios.get("/api/blogs/").then((res) => {
            setBlogs(res.data.blogs);
        }
    }

    return (
        <>
            {
               blogs.map((res) => <>

                   <b>{res.title}
                   // It is showing about 40 blogs.

                   <Link to={`blog-detail/${res.id}`}>Blog Detail</Link>4
                </>
            }
        </>
    )
}

When I click on Blog Detail and press button in Browser (Chrome) then It is setting state again.
What I have tried ?

I have also thought about Using LocalStorage with Redux Store like :-

const saveToLocalStorage = (state) => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem('state', JSON.stringify(state));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};

But the Array was 40 in length then I thought Would it be efficient to store that big array (40 maybe 100(max)) in localStorage ?`
Then I cancelled it.

Using only localStorage without redux but It was localStorage after all.

I have tried many times but it is still setting state with makeing request to backend server.
Any help would be much Appreicated.
