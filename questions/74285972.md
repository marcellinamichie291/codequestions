# What is a thread in a kotlin coroutine?

I have read many questions here and several books on kotlin coroutines, but none answers the question of what a thread is.
For example, I run an app on my huawei gr5, which has 4 cores. But people are talking about spawning 128 threads on the dispatcher.IO.
Is this thread the same as the logical thread when we say an Intel i5 cpu has 6 cores and 12 threads or is it just a concept, a set of CPU instructions?
Thank you.
