I have written a query to find the position a letter "a" in first_name column using INSTR function.
Worker table
 woraker_id | first_name | last_name | salary | joinig_date | department
-----------+------------+-----------+--------+-------------+------------

query
SELECT first_name, INSTR(first_name,"a") AS output FROM worker;


ERROR:  column "a" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT first_name, INSTR(first_name,"a") AS output FROM work...

Having fixed that I get another error
query
SELECT first_name, INSTR(first_name,'a') AS output FROM worker;

ERROR:

function instr(character varying, unknown) does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT first_name, INSTR(first_name,'a') AS output FROM work...
                    ^
HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
