# Getting data from ArrayList to alarm

I'm trying to make an Alarm that used both time and date from an ArrayList
the code is working but only from a String, I couldn't make it read a whole punch of time & data from my Array list
Here is my code:


try{
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the time that you want to get up in HH:mm format");
        String s= sc.next();
                System.out.println("Enter the time that you want to get up in HH:mm format");
        String date= sc.next();
        System.out.println("Your alarm is now set for "+s+" !!");  
                                            System.out.println("this is date"+date);

        while(1==1){    //An always true condition.
            String currentTime = new SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm").format(new Date());//Fetching the current system time.
            String currentDate = java.time.LocalDate.now().toString();
                        
                        boolean x = currentTime.equals(s);
                        boolean y = currentDate.equals(date);
            if(x==true && y==true){
                System.out.println("Wake up..Wake up. Its a brand new Day.!!"+currentDate+" "+y);
                                
                break;  //Using break to jump out of the loop as soon as the alarm rings.
            }
            else
                continue;  //To keep the program running until the desired time is reached.
                                
            }   
    }
    catch(Exception e){
        System.out.println("Ohh.. believe me, something's wrong");
       }
}



Here's my ArrayList
[[13:00:00, 2022-11-18], [13:00:00, 2022-11-18], [14:00:00, 2022-11-18], [10:00:00, 2022-11-19], [10:00:00, 2022-11-19], [10:00:00, 2022-11-19], [10:00:00, 2022-11-19], [09:00:00, 2022-11-05], [09:00:00, 2022-11-05], [09:00:00, 2022-11-05], [09:00:00, 2022-11-05], [13:00:00, 2022-11-05], [13:00:00, 2022-11-05], [13:00:00, 2022-11-05], [13:00:00, 2022-11-05], [13:00:00, 2022-11-05], [10:00:00, 2022-11-04], [10:00:00, 2022-11-04], [10:00:00, 2022-11-04], [10:00:00, 2022-11-04], [10:00:00, 2022-11-04], [10:00:00, 2022-11-03]]

I'm expecting for my alarm to read data from my ArrayList and works good with them all other than just working from a string (single alarm)
