# Is Vaadin using secure frontend dependencies?

I'm using the latest Vaadin 14 LTS Verson (14.8.20)
Upon building my project, intellij suggested installing the npm packages from the automatically created package.json.
NPM then told me it found 12 vulnerabilities of which 11 have a high severity.
So is Vaadin using outdated packages here? Is it dangerous to use this in production?
