Used an if statement before a for loop , but getting a syntax error , thought I needed to use an else statement would correct it but not sure (https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHLUV.jpg)
!I tried adding 'else continue' since I only want the elements that satisfy my if condition to be in my list , but even that is a syntax error I don't know why, (I am new to coding) (https://i.stack.imgur.com/E62g6.jpg)]
