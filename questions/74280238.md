I am getting this error "too many re-renders. react limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop."
I don't know what exactly I am doing wrong here, could anyone please help.
To help you understand: I have created a form where I want to take the input(name and location) from the user and show that input on a different page. I tried to integrate googleMaps API to show the location as per the input and m entire code crashed, otherwise it was working fine earlier, also if anyone could help me with the map here too? I have been banging my head trying to do it. I can display the map on a different page but I want to display the location on the map when the user writes any location in the input field of the form, hope I make sense.
