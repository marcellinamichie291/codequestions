# Showing the current time in seconds with a "0"

I want to show the current time in seconds.
However, I am using the DateFormatter for it.
But I dont know how to show a 0 before the number, when it is under 10.
For example: I dont want 2, but 02.
This is my code so far:
let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = "ss"
    
let time = formatter.string(from: date)

I also tried appending the 0, unfortunately it didnt work:
let timeWithNull1 = "0" + time
let timeWithNull2 = "0".appending(time)
