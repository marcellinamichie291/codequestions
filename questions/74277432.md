# .NET MAUI project properties is not loading in Visual Studio 2022

I have created a .NET MAUI application with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows and when I do right click on .NET MAUI project in Solution Explorer and navigate to Project Settings, the UI editor tries to initialize and stucks in a screen saying "Loading Properties...". I am waiting for a few minutes and nothing happens. I also tried to reproduce in a new project and  I have the same behavior. I also tried in Visual Studio 2022 (Preview) and same behavior here. I have updated both Visual Studio 2022 (Professional & Preview) and I have the same behavior. Any ideas why this happens ?
The only time project settings worked was only I accidently opened the Android manifest file. Then I tried to reproduced it again and nothing happens.
