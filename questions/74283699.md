Could anyone describe what is difference between openfeign/feign and spring cloud openfeign? I see spring cloud openfeign depends on openfeign/feign, but I couldn't get specific differences.
Is it always recommendable to use spring cloud openfeign rather than vanilla feign when I use spring framework?
