# How to avoid having duplicate binary values in R

I am currently working on building a simulation that simulates user interactions with fake/authentic FB news posts. As I built simulation using for loop, I've ran into the following problem:
First, I wanted to set my loop such that if a person reacts to a FB post (i.e leave a like, love, wow, haha, sad, angry, or care) he/she would leave only one reaction. For instance, if someone leaves a like, he/she shouldn't be able to leave other reactions like love, wow, etc.
This is the code I used for generating simulation data
#Creating empty dataframe 
fake_id<-1:1000
like<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
love<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
wow<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
haha<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
sad<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
angry<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
care<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
comment<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))
shares<-rep(NA,max(fake_id))

fake<-data.frame(fake_id,like,love,wow,haha,sad,angry,care,comment,shares)

#Probability distribution for user interaction with a given FB post
misinformation_prob<-c(0.090637966,0.015194195,0.023018674,0.013500845,0.001573673,0.017003550,0.002058321,0.003093388,0.001312486)
authentic_prob<-c(0.0275070460,0.0103958123,0.0060707537,0.0034785282,0.0007527044,0.0088240139,0.0020064930,0.0019195168,0.0006860144)
prob.dist<-data.frame(misinformation_prob,authentic_prob)
colnames(prob.dist)<-c("Misinformation","Authentic")
rownames(prob.dist)<-c("Likes","Comments","Shares","Loves","Wows","Hahas","Sads","Angrys","Cares")

prob.dist

#For loop used to create a simulated data

for(i in fake_id){
  fake$like[i]<-sample(x=c(0,1), size=1,prob=c(1-prob.dist[1,'Misinformation'],prob.dist[1,'Misinformation']))
  fake$comment[i]<-sample(x=c(0,1), size=1,prob=c(1-prob.dist[2,'Misinformation'],prob.dist[2,'Misinformation']))
  fake$shares[i]<-sample(x=c(0,1), size=1,prob=c(1-prob.dist[3,'Misinformation'],prob.dist[3,'Misinformation']))
   if(fake$like[i]==1){
    fake[i,3:8]=0
   }else for(j in 3:8){
     if(is.na(fake[i,j])==TRUE){
       fake[i,j]<-sample(x=c(0,1),size=1,prob=c(1-prob.dist[j+1,'Misinformation'],prob.dist[j+1,'Misinformation']))
     }
     if(fake[i,j]==1){
       fake[i,-j]==0
     }
   }
}

I hoped that by writing
 if(fake[i,j]==1){
       fake[i,-j]==0
     }

I'd be able to avoid having duplicate reactions like certain user liking and loving the post simultaneously. Yet, once I run the simulation, I'd occasionally run into this problem that I wanted to avoid. Any input regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you community!
