# deleting data by data quantity in pandas

I am trying to create a dataset for machine learning, but the data below a certain number reduces the quality of the algorithm, is there a way to delete data according to the number of data?

Is there a way to delete less than 180 of the data in this column, instead of discarding them one by one, according to the number of data? I have more than 10 columns and more than 2000 data for each column. There are about 10 data in each column that need to be deleted due to the amount of data, and when I try to delete it according to the data with the df.drop method, it creates 100 lines of code and is not dynamic. When another small amount of data is added, it causes it to not be deleted.
