# How to write a model with a collection of items based on a shared foreign key

I have a data model where one table (Content) holds data that is related to various other tables, because you can not have a foreign key pointing at multiple tables, I constructed a intermediate table to bind everything together.
So each table has a foreign key referring the 'common' table

Type1 => Common
Type2 => Common
Content => Common

Then based on Type1.CommonId I can find all Content rows that belong to a give Type1 row.
My problem is that I do not manage to create my models in such a way that I can easily access the related content.
I setup my model for Type1 like this:
public class Type1
{
   [Key] public string Id { get; set; }
   [ForeignKey("CommonId")] public string CommonId { get; set; }
   public Common Common { get; set; }
   public ICollection<Content> Content { get; set; }
}

By doing this however it seems that EF expects there to be Type1ID field in my Content table, which obviously defeats the entire purpose of this construction.
Any way I can make this work without having to fallback to creating an extra column for each type that links to Content ?
