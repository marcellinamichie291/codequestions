# Wordpress user restriction

Hi guys I was wondering how can one restrict the subscribers on wordpress based on their wordcount usage?
I have created a custom user role user paid membership pro plugin. Now Id like to restrict them based on their word count consumption. I have the following line of code within a plugin:
function pmpro_word_count_quota_init() {

    global $current_user;

//set word count quota for pmpro_role_2 users

$pmpro_role_2_quota = 1000;

//get current user


get_currentuserinfo();

//if user has pmpro_role_2 role, update their quota

if( in_array( 'pmpro_role_2', $current_user->roles ) )

update_user_meta( $current_user->ID, 'pmpro_word_count_quota', $pmpro_role_2_quota );

}
