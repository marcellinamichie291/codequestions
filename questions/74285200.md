# Is it possible to detect that a user exists or not on my.forms.app using a python?

Hey so i created a code where i can detect whether a website exists or not, this is the code that i use to detect that.
exist=[]
url = []

for b in websearch:
    try:
        request = requests.get(b)
        if request.status_code == 200:
            exist.append(b)
            print('Exist')
    except:
        print('Not Exist')

but there's another barrier that i have to go through and that is non-existent user from my.forms.app.
This is one of the example sites.

Since on my.forms.app you can just create a random name on the link and it's going to redirect to that webpage. is there a way where it can differentiate whether the user exists or not.
Thanks for the help!
EDIT:
I tried to make it that if it's 200 it exists if it's 204 user does not exist. is there a way where it would say user does not exist if it's 204
try:
    request = requests.get('https://api.forms.app/user/infobyname/minecraft123')
    if request.status_code == 200:
        print('Exist')
    elif request.status_code == 204:
        print('User does not exist')
except:
    print('Not Exist')
