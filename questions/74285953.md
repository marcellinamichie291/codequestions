# Need help optimizing runtime on a problem


I have two types of operations possible:
[0,a,b] - Create and save a rectangle of size axb
[1,a,b] - check whether every PREVIOUS saved rectangle can be fit inside this rectangle of axb. You can rotate rectangles by 90 degrees. We try to fit each rectangle one at a time and not together.
I need to return an array of booleans representing answers to second operation in the order in which they appear.
eg.
operations = [1,1,1]
output = [true]
No rectangles saved so they can fit inside anything.
ex.
operations = [[0,1,3], [0,4,2], [1,3,4], [1,3,2]]
output = [true,false]
[1,3] and 4,2 can fit inside [3,4] so true
[1,3] can fit but [4,2] cannot fit inside [3,2] so false.
I've tried the brute force solution of rotating each previous rectangle and checking if it fits and it is too slow
What's the faster solution?
