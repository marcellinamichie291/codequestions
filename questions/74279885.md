# NameError: name 'anekdot' is not defined. Did you mean: 'anekdots'?

Good afternoon, trying to output a random list item from this code
global anekdot

def randanek():

    anekdot = random.choice(anekdots)


randanek()
textaneka = anekdot

but for some reason the program doesn't see my variable and i see this error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 44, in <module>
    textaneka = anekdot
NameError: name 'anekdot' is not defined. Did you mean: 'anekdots'?

[cmd: ['python3', '-u', '']]
