# 3 arguments turned into a 2-tuple


Define a function named generate_point which takes 3 arguments (i.e. 2 numbers and a 6-tuple), and returns a
2-tuple.
Ex. Given inputs: 洧논, 洧녽 and c0, 洧녫1, 洧녫2, 洧녫3, 洧녫4, 洧녫5 the function shall calculate and return 洧논1 and 洧녽1 respectively as
follows:
洧논1 = 洧녫0洧논 + 洧녫1洧녽 + 洧녫2
洧녽1 = 洧녫3洧논 + 洧녫4洧녽 + 洧녫5

I was given the shell for generate_point as
def generate_point(x, y, cff) -> tuple:
   pass

I'm not sure where to go from here to begin inputs to form a 2-tuple.
