# How can I check if a sorted subarray with size 'k' , is contained in an bigger sorted array with size 'n' (k <= n) this complexity O(logn)?

I would like to find if a sorted subarray v' with size 'k' is contained in another sorted array with size 'n'. We know that k <= n. However, it would be so easy with a double for loop or something similar, however I would like to implement it with complexity O (logn).
For example, for v = [-10,-3,0,4,7,19,33] and v' = [4,7,19] it would say TRUE.
Could someone help me??????????
