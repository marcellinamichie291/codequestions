# Batch process language

I'm new to coding, and I'm thinking about what language I could study in order to be the most efficient in batch processing.
My question is general: what language would you recommend to do batch processing (as diverse as possible)?
I need your help to be "tooled up". I don't want to be frustrated by crashes in front of batch processing problems anymore.
