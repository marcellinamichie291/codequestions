# ADB get text from clipboard

I have a remote adb server with Bluestacks linked to it (via adb network option). I would like that my Python APP read the clipboard text copied from Bluestacks via adb client. I see lot of things but nothing works, i mean nothing, as what i m expecting :)

input keyevent 279 is good if i wanna copy the text somewhere on my application. I didn't find a way to redirect the output text to the STDOUT of the shell, perhaps it is just impossible :)
service call clipboard 1 looks no anymore accessible with the current API (i read that on an other thread and that since API 11)

I would like as i can use only adb shell without any third-party application on bluestacks that i need to install.
Somebody has a brillant idea? (FYI: I started to work with adb few weeks ago)
Best, John.
