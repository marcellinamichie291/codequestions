# How to programatically analyse solution configuration mappings

We are trying to use the Microsoft.Build NuGet package to be able to programatically analyse the configuration mapping in solution files.
As an example to be able to detect when a project is being built using Debug when the solution is being built using Release.
We are able to use the SolutionFile.Parse to load the solution file but it's not clear how the configuration mapping can be analysed.
Is it possible to do something like this?
