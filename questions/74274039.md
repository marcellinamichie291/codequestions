# How to generic piecewise function in Cplex?

I would like to ask about how to make a piecewise function allows generic pieces as below:
It works manually like this as if 2 steps:
piecewise{2->100; 3->200; 300->200; 2->300; 3->400; 300->400; 2->500; 3}(0,300) units

But I don't know how to generic it.
The graph would look as below:
y1=2x+300
y2=3x+200
Thank you for the help!
