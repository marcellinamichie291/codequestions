# Is it possible to add new packages and run docker dev file?

I have been working on Superset (cloned the code from superset github).Created new file under the folder superset/superset/ named db_access.py.
I have imported this file in the existing app.py file .Now have the following imports in the newly created file,
db_access.py
import boto3
import sys
import hvac
import pymysql
import psycopg2
import os
import io
import logging
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import traceback
from timestream_reader import Timestream_reader
import json
from pathlib import Path
from zenpy import Zenpy

app.py
import logging
import os
import json
from flask import Flask
from flask import request,jsonify
from superset.initialization import SupersetAppInitializer
import sys
from superset.db_access import Db_access

But when I try to compose the dev docker file with the above code, it shows error like hvac module not found (I tried pip install hvac and included that in requirements file too).Is there any other places that I need to customize based on new imports?
