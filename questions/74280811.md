# PowerShell command to set Visual Studio to Run as Administrator

I have been assigned the job of automating a long list of tasks for developers to load into Intune.
One of the tasks is to set the Run As Administrator feature to Visual Studio with a script.
I know you can right-click on the exe, go to properties > Advanced and set that setting, but I'm struggling to find a scriptable way to do that. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
