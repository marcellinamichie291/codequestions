# Pass few but not all optional arguments to a TCL procedure

In TCL the way to make a parameter optional is to give it a default value. I don't know if there are any other ways too. e.g
proc my_func {a b c {d 10} {e 11} {f 12}} {
  ...
}

Now in the above example the parameters a, b and c are compulsory. The parameters d, e and f are optional. Is there another way to create optional parameters?
I am in a situation where I need to create a parameter that can be called from a TCL terminal (in Xilinx Vivado) which has some optional parameters. The user decide to pass a few or all of the optional parameters or none at all. The problem is that, when using positional argument passing, it is impossible to tell TCL which optional parameter we are passing to it. What is the solution to this? e.g
my_func 1 2 3 4 5 6 

shall call the my_func with values a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5 and f=6. Also,
my_func 1 2 3 4 

shall call my_func with values a=1, b=2, c=3 and d=4 and the e, f left at their default values. However, I might need to do something like this
my_func 1 2 3 100

where I am passing 100 to f and leave c and d at default value. But the above stament will set d to 100 instead and leave e and f at their default values.
What is the solution since I can clearly not use the positional argument technique here.
