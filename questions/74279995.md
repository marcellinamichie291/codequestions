I am trying to recode a variable that indicates total number of responses to a multiple response survey question. Question 4 has options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and participants may choose one or more options when submitting a response. The data is currently coded as binary outputs for each option: var Q4___1 = yes or no (1/0), var Q4___2 = yes or no (1/0), and so forth.
This is the tabstat of all yes (1) responses to the 6 Q4___* variables
  Variable |       Sum
-------------+----------
      q4___1 |        63
      q4___2 |        33
      q4___3 |         7
      q4___4 |         2
      q4___5 |         3
      q4___6 |         7
------------------------
total = 115

I would like to create a new variable that encapsulates these values.
Can someone help me figure out how to create this variable, and if coding a variable in this manner for a multiple option survey question is valid?
When I used the replace command the total number of responses were not adding up, as shown below
  gen q4=. 
    replace q4 =1 if q4___1 == 1
    replace q4 =2 if q4___2 == 1
    replace q4 =3 if q4___3 == 1 
    replace q4 =4 if q4___4 == 1
    replace q4 =5 if q4___5 == 1
    replace q4 =6 if q4___6 == 1
    label values q4 primarysource`

      q4 |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.
------------+-----------------------------------
          1 |         46       48.94       48.94
          2 |         31       32.98       81.91
          3 |          6        6.38       88.30
          4 |          1        1.06       89.36
          5 |          3        3.19       92.55
          6 |          7        7.45      100.00
------------+-----------------------------------
      Total |         94      100.00
