# getting FirebaseApp with name [DEFAULT] doesn't exist after deploying spring boot jar file on AWS beanstalk

I have a spring boot rest api which uploads some documents on firestore DB. Problem is when I am running locally it is working absolutely fine without causing any issue. but when I am packaging it as a jar and uploading in AWS beanstalk. That endpoint giving below error response.
{
    "timestamp": "2022-11-01T13:53:21.121+00:00",
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "FirebaseApp with name [DEFAULT] doesn't exist. ",
}

This is how I am reading the firebase service account (file name is serviceaccount.json) file which is located in src/main/resources folder and I have
firebase.credential.resource=serviceaccount.json entry in my application.properties

@Value("${firebase.credential.resource}")
String resourcePath;


@PostConstruct
public void initialize() {

    try {

        Resource resource = new ClassPathResource(resourcePath);
        //FileInputStream serviceAccount = new FileInputStream(resource.getFile());
        
         FirebaseOptions options = new FirebaseOptions.Builder()
                .setCredentials(GoogleCredentials.fromStream(resource.getInputStream()))
                .build();
        if (FirebaseApp.getApps().isEmpty()) {
            FirebaseApp.initializeApp(options);
        }

    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
