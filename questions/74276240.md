# How to add environment map to custom ShaderMaterial in Three js

I've been trying to add an environment app to a custom Shader Material using three's MeshPhysical fragment shader and my own vertex shader. I am setting the envMap in the custom uniforms and in the material attribute, but it does not work. I will be pasting the code below, any help would be greatly appreciated.


    var blobMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
        uniforms:  THREE.UniformsUtils.clone(THREE.ShaderLib.physical.uniforms),
        vertexShader: THREE.ShaderLib.physical.vertexShader,//physicalVertexShader,
        fragmentShader: THREE.ShaderLib.physical.fragmentShader,
        lights: true,
    });

    // var blobMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    //  envMapIntensity:0.5,
    //  color:0xf67104
    // })
    blobMaterial.envMap = envMap;
    blobMaterial.combine = THREE.MultiplyOperation;
    blobMaterial.uniforms.envMap.value = envMap;
    // blobMaterial.uniforms.envMapIntensity.value = 1;

    blob = new THREE.Mesh(
        new THREE.IcosahedronGeometry( 20, 120 ),
        blobMaterial
    );



I tried following this https://jsfiddle.net/rtemj7va/, but still to no avail.
