# git merge command renames the file to original value

I must be doing something wrong. There are 2 branches, develop and feature.
I decided to start feature branch and implement some radical changes. This includes renaming the files (changing file name and path) and content inside. Content change roughly 30-40%.
During that time, develop branch continued with new code dvp and then merge feature -> develop happened.
During merge, feature to develop, for some reason, git renamed new files from feature branch to the name they were used to be in the develop branch. According to the git Extension GUI I use, it seems that git detected the filepath change (from file content similarities?).
What could be the reason that git nonchalant thought it can change the file name and paths. This indeed destroyed build since in C language, #include "file.." was not found anymore.
