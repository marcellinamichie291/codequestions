# passing structs to file functions

hi guys im currently learning c and i have to pass a struct between multiple files for my project in uni . no matter what i do i keep getting errors when i try to pass a struct to a function. i have tired moving the function between being a global variable in main.c and i have tried putting it in a .h file, but i cannot figure it out, i keep hitting the same error messages when i try to gcc it . im having no problems using it in my main file but passing my variable to my functions in external files is where its getting errors i i will include my files that are relevant and my error messages when i gcc it. any help will be much appreciated cheers .
main.c
int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
const int bufferSize=10;
int const nBuffer = 50;
char iptName [nBuffer];

empInfo* info;
 info = (empInfo*)malloc(bufferSize * sizeof (empInfo));
if (info == NULL){
 printf("*malloc* array not allocated\n");}
 printf("malloc worked");
nameFinderPrinter(iptName,info,bufferSize);
return;} 

fileFunctions.c
void nameFinderPrinter(char name[],empInfo* info, int size){
bool nameTF;

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
if (strcmp(name, info[i].names )== 0);

 printf("%s age is %d wage is %f\n",info[i].names,info[i].ages,info[i].wages);
 nameTF=true;}
 if(nameTF ==false){
 printf("%s could not be found\n",name);}
return;}

struct.h
typedef  struct employeeInfo   
{
  char names[50]; 
  int ages;
  float wages; 
} empInfo;

i have tried using pointers to 'info[10]' and rewriting how i pass it to the function in every way i can think of only way that works is to send the internal information of the struct bit by bit like 'info[i].name' i have attempted to make info a global variable and accessing it in the function globally.  i am sorry if its messy i am still getting used to how to properly present my code on here and in general
