# trying to solve workbooks.open in filedirectory error

Hi I feel very silly and I'm stuck.
I would like to open a file on the following location:
F:\users\DC Holwerda, Almere\Logistieke accounts\AA. Logistiek Thom\Data analyse 2022\Keukens Analyse\Query Talis
I can't get workbooks.open to work. Has something changed?
see the code below:
Sub openfile()

Workbooks.Open "F:\users\DC Holwerda, Almere\Logistieke accounts\AA. Logistiek Thom\Data analyse 2022\Keukens Analyse\Query Talis\Forecast.xlsx"

End Sub

when I run the code the following error pop's up:

translated to English: a function or variable is expected
