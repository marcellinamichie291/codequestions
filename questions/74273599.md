# Is there a way to remove email from being displayed in JWT dajngo?

I have this simple example in Django to create JWT using djangorestframework-jwt
this is my code:
user_payload = TbaleUsers.objects.get(email="test@gmail.com")
encoded_payload = jwt_payload_handler(user_payload)
access_token = jwt.encode(encoded_payload, SECRET_KEY, ALGORITHM)

When I get the access token and I go to this website https://jwt.io/ and place it there it shows me the user id, username and email
I want to remove the email from being shown
Is there a way to do that?
