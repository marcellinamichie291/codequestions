# Set colors in a graph

I have 6 different columns in my dataset (cum_return_pf) which are plotted in a graph (see below). The resulting 6 lines all have a random color.
How can I set the colors of each line by my own? I need that, because I want to have always the same colors in different plots
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    
    
    ax = cum_return_pf.plot(figsize=(10, 5))
    ax.set(xlabel="Year", ylabel="Return") 
    plt.savefig('Comparison.jpg', dpi=300)
