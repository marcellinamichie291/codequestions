# TicTacToe Python

Here is the code. I am trying to replace the number grid with the 'X' or 'O' from the input. I can't figure out how to replace this type of dictionary.
The Error:
theBoard.append(move)
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
"""Tic-Tac-Toe is played according to the following rules.

1. The game is played on a grid that is three squares by three squares.
2. Player one uses x's. Player two uses o's.
3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
5. If all nine squares are full and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

I tried .append() and .update() but the code popped up errors and crashed. I am expecting it to go like this.
Player1 'x' your turn: 1

 1 | 2 | 3  
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

player2 'o' your tunr:

 X | 2 | 3  
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
