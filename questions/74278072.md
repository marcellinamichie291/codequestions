# How to compare cells one by one between two Excel sheets?

I'm trying to write a VBA code and I'm having some issues.
Here's the context, I have an Excel spreadsheet with two sheets, "Sheet1" and "Sheet2"
I want my VBA code to compare two rows of cells.
Here's what my Sheet1 looks like:

And here's what my Sheet2 looks like:

As you can see, I have the same number of cells to compare however, one of them is not the same.
What I want my VBA code to do, is to compare one by one the cells between Sheet1 and Sheet2. And once the code spots two cells who are not identical, a MsgBox appears saying "Cells are not the same". In that case, it is for cells "D1"
It sounds pretty basic and simple to do, but I'm really struggling.
Here are the first lines of code I have but it doesn't work:
Dim RangeSheet1 As Range, RangeSheet2 As Range

Set RangeSheet1 = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
Set RangeSheet2 = Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A1")

Do While RangeSheet1.Value = RangeSheet2.Value

RangeSheet1.Offset(0,1)
RangeSheet2.Offset(0,1)
Loop

MsgBox "Cells are not the same"

Do you guys have any idea how I can do it the right way?
Thank you very much for your help.
