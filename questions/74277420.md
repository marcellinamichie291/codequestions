# Conditional Regex not working as expected

I'm trying to write a conditional Regex to achieve the following:
If the word "apple" or "orange" is present within a string:
   there must be at least 2 occurrences of the word "HORSE" (upper-case)
else 
   there must be at least 1 occurrence of the word "HORSE" (upper-case)

What I wrote so far:
(?(?=((apple|orange).*))(HORSE.*){2}|(HORSE.*){1})
I was expecting this Regex to work as I'm following the pattern (?(?=regex)then|else).
However, it looks like (HORSE.*){1} is always evaluated instead. Why?
