# How to populate <input /> with default value?

I'm surprised how hard this is.
just trying to do <input defaultValue={myValueFromApi} />
that doesn't work. I've read only I have to do: <input defaultValue={myValueFromApi} key={myValueFromApi}/> this seems a dumb hack and even worse it loses focus on every key stroke?!
How is something so easy not working? how can I fix this?
