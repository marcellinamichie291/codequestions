# Checking if a folder is in the current directory

I want to check if there exist a folder in the current folder my code is in, how can this be done?
What I mean is, we have folder called code_folder, which has the python code, i want to check in this python code if in this code_folder we have another folder called folder_1, if is it exists we can store something in it, if not we creat the folder and store something in it.
