# Select case returning an error when both elemements not varchar in some cases

I wanted to return a value formatted with commas at every thousand if a number or just the value if it wasn't a number
I used the following statement which returned the error: Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value '1,000' to data type int.
Declare @QuantityToDelete int = 1000

SELECT CASE 
    WHEN ISNUMERIC(@QuantityToDelete)=1 
        THEN format(cast(@QuantityToDelete as int),'N0') 
        ELSE @QuantityToDelete 
END [Result]

I can get it to work by using the following
SELECT CASE 
    WHEN ISNUMERIC(@QuantityToDelete)=1 
        THEN format(cast(@QuantityToDelete as int),'N0') 
        ELSE cast(@QuantityToDelete as varchar) 
END [Result]


Result=1,000

Why doesn't the first example work when the ELSE @QuantityToDelete part of the statement isn't returned?
If I use the below switching the logic condition
SELECT CASE 
    WHEN ISNUMERIC(@QuantityToDelete)=0 
        THEN format(cast(@QuantityToDelete as int),'N0') 
        ELSE @QuantityToDelete 
END [Result]



Result=1000

Which is expected, but no error, the case statement still has unmatched return types an nvarchar and an int as in the first example just different logic?
