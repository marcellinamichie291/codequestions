# Find the second week in Postgresql

I have data consisting of:




CustomerID
Trans_date
Week_ISO




C001
01-sep-22
35


C001
04-sep-22
35


C001
14-sep-22
37


C002
03-sep-22
35


C002
01-sep-22
35


C002
18-sep-22
37


C002
20-sep-22
38


C003
02-sep-22
35


C003
28-sep-22
39


C004
08-sep-22
36


C004
18-sep-22
37




There's my code before:
create or replace view the_view as
select customerid, trans_date, 
       extract('week' from trans_date) week_iso
from the_table;

Next I want to find out, in what week will CustomerID return? it will look like this:




CustomerID
Week_ISO
first
second




C001
35
35
37


C001
35
35
37


C001
37
35
37


C002
35
35
37


C002
35
35
37


C002
37
35
37


C002
38
35
37


C003
35
35
39


C003
39
35
39


C004
36
36
37


C004
37
36
37




and lastly, so that there are no duplicates on the CustomerID, the final display is expected to be like this.




CustomerID
first
second




C001
35
37


C002
35
37


C003
35
39
