# Maximum Score a Mathematician can score

For an array A of n integers, a mathematician can perform the following moves move on the array
1. Choose an index i(0<=i<length(A)) and add A[i] to scores
2. Discard either the left partition(i.e A[0....i-1]) or the right
 partition(i.e A[i+1 ... length(A)-1]). the partition discarded can be empty too. 
the selected partition becomes the new value of A and is used for 
subsequent operations.


Starting from the initial score of 0 mathematician wishes to find the maximum score achievable after K moves.
Example:
A = [4,6,-10,-1,10,-20], K = 4
Maximum Score is 19
I tried a dynamic programming solution with the following subproblem and recurrence relation:
opt(i,j,k) = maximum score possible using element from index i to j in k moves

opt(i,j,k) = max( opt(i,j,k), a[l] + max(opt(i,l-1,k-1), opt(l+1,j,k-1)) 
 for l ranging from i to j (inclusive).


the complexity of the above dp solution is: n^3k
Can you help me with a better solution?
