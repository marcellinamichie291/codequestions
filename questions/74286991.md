# Inplace operation on specific lines and columns of dataframe

Say I have a dataframe with negative value on a specific columns (here, 1rst and 2nd columns):
df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 1, -1],[-1, 1, 1],[-1, -1, 1]])

Now, I want to inplace clip the negative values to 0 on only specific lines and columns:
df.loc[[1, 2], [0, 1]].clip(lower=0, inplace=True)

But this doesn't work:
df
Out: 
   0  1  2
0  1  1 -1
1 -1  1  1
2 -1 -1  1

This is because slicing dataframe with a list of integers returns a copy:
df.loc[[1, 2], [0, 1]] is df.loc[[1, 2], [0, 1]]
Out: False

How do I make inplace changes to specific rows and columns then?
