# Is there a fallback for the method Application.ShowMe from Office-Automation?

The method Application.ShowMe from Office-Automation is deprecated.
With the last Microsoft Update the call of this method results with 0x800A1088.
Is there a fallback for Application.ShowMe() ? or is it sufficient to set the property "Visible" to True ?
thanks
I just set the property "Visible" to True.
