powershell get-wmiobject wildcards - Batch File
IÂ´m struggling with on batch file here..   The idea is to get the version of the applications installed on a remote pc, but instead of writing the full application name ( that can be a bit different from client to client) i want to use a Wildcard for it..
Unfortunantly GET-WmiObject operator, does not work the the parameter ( -like) as SQL..
The powershell command below works like i want , but when i add it the the batch file, it does not work...
Power Shell command that work :
[tag:Get-WmiObject -ComputerName ##PCNAMEHERE## -Query "Select * From Win32_Product Where name Like 'McAfee%'" | select Name, Version]

Line on the batch program
\[tag:get specific app  with Wildcards !!!!!  Need corrections !!!

Powershell.exe Get-WmiObject -ComputerName %CN% -Query Select \* From Win32_Product Where name Like ''McAfee%'' | select Name, Version \>\>%LOG%\]

Error that i get on the batch execution...  Already try to play with " and ' but without success ...
Get-WmiObject : A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument '*'.
