# Database design between three entities, what should the relationship be between them

I'm currently designing a DB for complaints service.
My main entities that I need to work with is [Complaint, Reporter, Reported]
I need the reporters to be able to add multiple complaints and the reported also have multiple complaints attached to him using the same phone number.
/*
The Reported entity has the information about every reported numbers such as phoneNumber, the STATUS etc. .
The Reporter entity has the information about the reporters, phone number, name etc. every reporter can submit multiple complaint about multiple reported number. all these complaint should be saved in the Complaint entity, And every reported number can have multiple rows each with different type of complaint.
*/
how should the relationship between these three entities look like ?
this is what I was thinking the relationship should look like:-
@Entity
@Table(name = "complaints_tbl")
@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Complaint extends BaseEntity{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "complaint_Id", nullable = false)
    private Long complaint_Id;

    @NotNull
    @CreatedDate
    @Column(name = "issuing_date", updatable = false)
    private LocalDate issuingDate;
    private String message;

    @NotNull
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "reporter_Id")
    private Reporter reporterId;

    @NotNull
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "reported_Id")
    private Reported reportedId;


    @NotNull
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "operator_Id")
    private Operator operator;

    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private Enum Type;

    private int complaint_Counter;
}



@Entity
@Table
@Getter
@Setter
public class Reported extends BaseEntity{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "reported_Id",  nullable = false, insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Long reported_Id;

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    private String reportedPhoneNumber;

    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private String status;
}


@Entity
@Table
@Getter
@Setter

public class Reporter extends BaseEntity{

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "reporter_Id", nullable = false, insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Long reporter_Id;

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    private String reporterPhoneNumber;

    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private int numberOfComplaints;
}
