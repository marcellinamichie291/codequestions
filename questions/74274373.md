# Make HTTP request to a certain URL and check on HTTP status code in React app

I am using Apollo Client to make GraphQL request in my React app.
I have to make an HTTP request to a certain path like: http://my-site.com/abc/token
How do I do that? Is that possible with Apollo Client? And then how do I check on Status code = 200?
