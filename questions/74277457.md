# Rstudio: Troubleshooting dominance analysis script

I have been trying to get this dominance analysis running https://supp.apa.org/psycarticles/supplemental/apl0000361/Supplemental-Material.zip, but I keep getting this:
"Error in if (class(userDat) == "data.frame") { :
the condition has length > 1"
I have been able to get the script running by "hardcoding" all the "default values for the simulation", but then I am only able to run the uncorrected analysis.
I suspect something's wrong with the if-else statement, but I have not been able to solve it thus far. I have tried using both a data.frame object containing the real observations a correlation matrix from observed data.
Any help is much appreciated!
