# Use Guzzle/Middleware with Curl in Laravel 9

viewers! Thanks for your attention.
I'm try to use Guzzle/Middleware :: History with Curl in Laravel 9. I'm trying to keep record for each API called during a job in laravel 9. Somewhere I've used Guzzle and somewhere I've used Curl. For Guzzle I've found this link helpful. I wanna use same middle with my curl.
Is there any way to achieve this? Thank you in advance,
Any suggestion other than this middleware to keep record of all APIs call in laravel Job?
Guzzle/Middleware::history
