I am trying to send the output of a linux command as an input to variable. Here is the command I tried
cat init.txt | grep glal20213lvdlb04
glal13lvd            


The output of this should go into "vm_name" of the yml file. The yml file will look like this.
vim instant.yml

resources:

  instance01:
    type: ../../../templates/ipnf.yaml
    properties:
      vm_name: 'THE OUTPUT SHOULD COME HERE'
      vm_flavour: 'dsolate'
      image_name: 'pdns_14121207'
      vm_az: 'az-1'
      vm_disk_root_size: '50'
      vm_disk_data_size: '50'
      network_mgmt_refs: 'int:dxs_pcg'
      network_mgmt_ip: '10.194.112.75'

Any help would be appreciated
