# How can re-use the index value from one section to another one? JavaScript

I'm trying to replace the [0] for the index value obtained in the code above.
The data[0] is coming from a Json file, and the index value is coming from the month selection.
So my goal is to update the data coming from JSON file after the user select a month from the drop down menu.
//Getting the index after selecting a month:
months.forEach((el, index) => {
  el.onclick = function () {
    const indexValue = Number(index);
    const monthSelected = (monthText.textContent = this.innerHTML);
    console.log(monthSelected);
    console.log(indexValue);
    return indexValue;
  };
});


//Here's is where I need to change that hard coded 0 for something:
// Step2
const jsonData = fetch("data.json")
  .then(function (resp) {
    return resp.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    const generalData = data[0];
