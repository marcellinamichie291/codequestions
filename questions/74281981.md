So the values for ans are a,b, c or d. what value should  I use to not reference these values to play the alternative clip of idiot? for the else. i tried false, true null and void.
document.querySelector("#submit").onclick = (_) => {
// submit button ==> submit answer
if (questions.Q) {
// only after game is initialised ...
const ans = document.querySelector("#answer-holder input:checked");
 ++qcount.textContent;
  if (ans.value == questions.Q.answer)

giveMe.play();
++acount.textContent;
nextQ();
} else { (ans.value == "")
idiot.play();

}
