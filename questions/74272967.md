# To forecasting that can predict future data (example x day)

I have Timeseries dataset. I have used cross validation and XGBregressor model. Now i want to forcast my prediction for particular x day.
As per my understaning any fundamental ML prediction model can be expressed as : y = a. f(x)+b. where x = input, b= bias, y= prediction.
I have already trained the model. So for my case x will be time vector. Now the predicted forcasted output matrix say Y already contains all the forcast of x days/month which include everything.
So only thing for me is now to filter out from data what I need.
So, I am trying to write a fucntion argument where Y is the argument and from that i want to filter out for example it say below 20% or what will be forcast on 36 day. Can someone explain me how i can write this?
