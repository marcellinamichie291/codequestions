# Print doesnt work if i set my python exe as default app

So i made a python small skript to automatically prints files if you open the file with my program, wich works. For my task i want to print every pdf file I open, so i set my exe as default app to open pdf files. But as soon as i set the exe as default it wont work anymore and i cant figure out why.
The Errormessage:
Traceback: (most recen call last):
File "AutomaticPrint.py", line 11, in <module>
OSError: [WinError 1155] No application is associate with the specified file for this operation 'C:\\Users\....myfile.pdf'

Here is my Code:
