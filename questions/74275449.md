# R - weird result from difftime function

I was using the difftime function from the base package in R and based on my data I found a couple of weird return values of this function:
> difftime("2014-10-29", "2014-10-21", units = "days")
Time difference of 8.041667 days
> difftime("2020-4-04", "2020-3-28", units = "days")
Time difference of 6.958333 days

Any idea why those values are not integers? Thanks!
All I see in the doc, relevant to it is:
"Note that units = "days" means a period of 24 hours, hence takes no account of Daylight Savings Time. Differences in objects of class "Date" are computed as if in the UTC time zone."
