# Tomcat 9 datasource URL syntax to connect to an oracle DB

Im gonna do a datasource Tomcat 9.0.63 to connect to my Oracle DB.
Actually we use dataguard (2 db, a main one and a backup one)
In the configuration of server.xml file , in order to set the connection, i wonder in the parameter "URL" if i can use the following syntax:
jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST =(LOAD_BALANCE=off)(FAILOVER=ON) (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = HOSTNAMEMAINDB)(PORT = 1521))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = HOSTNAMEBACKUPDB)(PORT = 1521)))(CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = SERVICENAME) (FAILOVER_MODE = (TYPE = SELECT)(METHOD = BASIC)(RETRIES = 120)(DELAY = 5))))
The questio would be if the datasource tomcat would support this syntax
Thank you very much
Ive tried with non Dataguard configuration and that work, i wonder if that would work with this configuration
