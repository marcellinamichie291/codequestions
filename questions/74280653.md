# How do you parse pdf files from a raw dataset in Foundry?

I have a raw dataset which comprises of multiple PDF files. I want to be able to get a Foundry Dataset which has the text for each of these pdfs in one column, and the name of the document in the other.

Let's assume xyz.pdf has text asdf
Let's assume yyz has text zxcv
I want a dataset which has:
doc_name | text |
-----------------
xyz.pdf  | asdf |
yyz.pdf  | zxcv |

My approach is to open the file, and send to a library which does document parsing (tika, pdfplumber, docquery).  When I run something like this:
with source.filesystem().open('xyz.pdf','rb') as f:
    pdf = pdfplumber.open(f)
    print(pdf)

I get the error:
  File "/tmp/conda-xyz/real/environment/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pdfminer/psparser.py", line 220, in seek
    self.fp.seek(pos)
io.UnsupportedOperation: File or stream is not seekable.

If I just try and open the file directly, I get:
pdf = pdfplumber.open('xyz.pdf')

I get the error:
  File "/tmp/conda-xyz/real/environment/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pdfplumber/pdf.py", line 71, in open
    stream = open(path_or_fp, "rb")
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'xyz.pdf'
