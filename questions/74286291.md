I have use grand function in my c project and it gives me "grand was not declared in this scpoe"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <windows.h>
int main()
{
    grand(time(NULL));
    printf("zar atmak icin enter bas");
    int tut, sayac=1;
    
    do
    {
        tut = rand() %2 + 1;
        if(tut==1)
        {
        
            printf("Tura");
            sayac++;
        }
    }while(tut!=2);
    printf("%d. denemede yaziyi buldunuz ", sayac);
    getche();
}

How can I run this project without declared error.
