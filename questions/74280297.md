# MongoDB: return a single field from the matched item of a sub-document array

Consider I have the following document structure:
{
  "_id": ObjectID(),
  "foo": "FOO",
  "bar": "BAR",
  "items": [
    {
      "foo": "FOO",
      "bar": "BAR",
      "name": "hello",
      "value": "50"
    },
    {
      "foo": "FOO",
      "bar": "BAR",
      "name": "bye",
      "value": "300"
    },
    {
      "foo": "FOO",
      "bar": "BAR",
      "name": "welcome",
      "value": "500"
    }
  ],
}

I would like to find all items that match both the following conditions:

name = "hello"
value != 0

And for each matched item I would like to return only the value field. I don't need all the other fields (foo/bar in this example).
So the ideal result should look like this:
[
  { value: "50" },
  { value: "100" },
  { value: "30" },
  â€¦
]

How do I do this with MongoDB?
I've tried this query:
// filter
{
  items: {
    $elemMatch: {
      name: "hello",
      value: { $ne: "0" },
    },
  }
}

// projection
{ 
  "_id": 0,
  "items.$": 1
}

It matches the items correctly, but it returns the whole items and I want only a single field from it.
Sadly, I can't use projection like this: "items.$.value": 1.
I've also tried the following aggregation:
{
  $unwind: {
    path: "$items"
  }
}
{
  $match: {
    "items.name": "hello",
    "items.value": { $ne: "0" },
  }
}
{
  $replaceRoot: {
    newRoot: "$items"
  }
}
{
  $project: {
    "value": 1
  }
}

It works perfectly and returns the expected result, but I have a feeling that it will have poorer performance.
Is there a way to achieve what I want with optimal performance?
