# How can I run just the statement my cursor is on in SQL Server Management Studio?

As a long time Toad for Oracle user, I have gotten used to hitting Ctrl+Enter and having just the statement under the cursor be executed.
In SQL Server Management Studio, hitting F5 runs the entire script. To run just the current statement, I have to manually highlight the statement I want, and then hit F5.
That is really annoying to me. Does anyone know of a tool with a keyboard shortcut to run just the current statement on a SQL Server? I would change tools just for this one feature.
Note: Oddly enough, even the free Toad for SQL Server does not let you run just the statement under the cursor.
