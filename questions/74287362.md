# Testing and Prediction on Cnn model

I trained a CNN model but didnt test( dont want my model to see test data). And I wanna make prediction and plot Confusion matrix. Can I make it ?
I split my trained data into validation data ( with validation_slpit ) so my Val folder (which is have just 100 images ) became useless. Can I make prediction on this Val folder to dont let my model cant see test datas
