# MFC CListCtrl groupview overriding GridLines

I'm trying to make a list with gridlines and groupview, I get gridlines when i dont enable group view but when I do there are no gridlines to be found. Is there any way to enable gridlines while using groupview?
I tried using ListView_EnableGroupView to enable group view and ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyle to enable gridlines and I expected to have a list with groupview and gridlines but in the end i just got a list with group view and no gridlines
