# How to change the background color depending on the text view

I would like to change the background color depending on the bluetooth status. When the button is clicked, the text (Bluetooth on) appears in the text view. After the second press of the same button, the text (Bluetooth Off) appears and I wanted to change the background color depending on the text.
`

switch (Tv.getText().toString()){
    case "Bluetooth ON":
        layoutleft.setBackgroundResource(R.color.Green);
        break;

    case "Bluetooth OFF":
        layoutleft.setBackgroundResource(R.color.Red);
        break;


}

`
I tried to do it like this: (code ) seems to work but doesn't change dynamically until after turning the screen off and on.
