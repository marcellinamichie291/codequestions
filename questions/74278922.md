# Dynamic dependant data validation in multiple cells

I am banging my head with the following issue - I have a table where I input all invoices received with customer name, invoice number and amount. In a separate sheet I have a table where I enter all payments on invoices received.
In the Payments table I have created a data validation list for the Customer input column and I want to have another data validation for the invoice number based on the selected customer.
In other words I want to limit the invoice column to only include invoices from the selected customer.
I have attached a screenshot to demonstrate what I am trying to do.
Thank you for your support.
