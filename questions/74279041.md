# Is it possible to fill the color in beginContour in p5js?

I am working on a project to build the sweater model and I have the functionality to add an image to mask the image in the sweater. Iâ€™m using contours for this. I want to change the color of only the contoured part, but the problem appears there.
The code is like this:
p5.beginShape();
p5.vertex(0, 0);
p5.vertex(p5.width, 0);
p5.vertex(p5.width, p5.height);
p5.vertex(0, p5.height);
p5.beginContour();
p5.fill(255,0,0);

// sweater model here

p5.endContour();
p5.endShape(p5.CLOSE);

The issue is that when I give fill, it gives color to the whole canvas, but I just want to have color in the contour part.
Is it possible to do so?
I tried to add the fill function between beginContour() and endContour, but it does not work.
