# Terminated with exception (report_on_exception is true)

I'm trying to upgrade rails version in my ruby project from rails 6 to rails 6.1.7. After fixing rails version in Gemfile "gem 'rails', '6.0.0' to gem 'rails', '6.1.7'", i deleted Gemfile.lock and ran the command "bundle install" but it didn't see the executable. Due to a long wait, I pressed "Ctrl + C" and saw the following error::
[root@0b2784b4e7bc project]# bundle install
Don't run Bundler as root. Bundler can ask for sudo if it is needed, and installing your bundle as root will break this application for all non-root users on this machine.

I'm not sure why this error and how to fix it? I also tried to search google but maybe my search skills are weak so I couldn't find a similar case. Who can help me in this case?
Thanks very much!
