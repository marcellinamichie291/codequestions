# How to decide whether or not to implement SCIM endpoint

This question is asked in the context where a company wants to implement a new SaaS solution with a REST API plus a single-page web-application on top of it,
where authentication and authorization and also user management are to be implemented using Microsoft Identity Platform and Microsoft Azure Active Directory.
I am wondering if in such a scenario, an own SCIM (2.0) endpoint is needed at all, or if perhaps simply a user management API (which itself may or may not be SCIM compliant) of Microsoft Identity Platform or Microsoft Azure Active Directory can be used for user management, so that users would only be stored and managed within AD for now.
