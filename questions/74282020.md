# Can Haar Training in python detect bird body parts?

Just to be aware of the context :
I am doing a university project that is a kind of must do , I have to analyze a bird behavior using Haar model to determine the following :
    1) Head Movement 
    2) Tail Shake 
    3) Fluffing 
    4) Steps 
    5) Object Touch 

Why Haar Model ?! I dunno , this is the professor's requirments. 
How to do it ?! He is asking me to improvise , but I can't see any solution to it.
Back to the question :
Is it doable to detect the above mentioned points using Haar Model ?!
P.S. Why Haar model ?! He kinda forced us to use it with the opencv-python library.
I am currently trying to detect the bird itself for starters , but after that I have no f clue what to do.
