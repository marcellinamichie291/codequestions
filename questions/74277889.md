# Remove duplicate sequences of events in Presto SQL

I'm looking for a way in SQL (I'm using Presto) to gather unique sequences of events. I need to remove duplicate events that are right next to each other, always taking the latest one.
So for instance, in this dataset, we see duplicate B.




id
event
time




1
A
10:01 AM


1
B
10:02 AM


1
B
10:03 AM


1
A
10:04 AM


1
B
10:05 AM




I'm looking for the output like this (notice how the duplicate B at 10:02 is removed since it's followed by another B?)




id
event
time




1
A
10:01 AM


1
B
10:03 AM


1
A
10:04 AM


1
B
10:05 AM
