# How to group by 1 column with select *

i'm currently struggling with an SQL task.
I have an select Statement like this
SELECT * FROM data dt LEFT JOIN payment pm ON pm.month = dt.month AND pm.persID = dt.persID
Two Colums of data table are relevant for the condition (data.department, pm.payout).
Now i need all Information grouped by department where payout = 0.
I tried first to simply group by department
SELECT * FROM data dt LEFT JOIN payment pm ON pm.month = dt.month AND pm.persID = dt.persID GROUP BY dt.department
But this error occurs: Selected non-aggregate values must be part of the associated group.
Then i tried it with first checking if the payout is 0.
SELECT * FROM data dt LEFT JOIN payment pm ON pm.month = dt.month AND pm.persID = dt.persID WHERE pm.payout = 0
