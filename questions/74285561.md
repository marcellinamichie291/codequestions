# REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES issue detected by google even though we don't have one

App build with ActionScript3/Harman SDK but we don't even have REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES declared in our xml.
Also, I already checked the APK via Android Studio, the AndroidManifest doesn't contain also REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES.
Any fix or advice for this? Thank you.
We checked our SDKs/ANE DISTRIQT and none of them that we are using is using the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES.
