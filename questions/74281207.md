# Pretty format plugin: Range error: Invalid string length

I'm trying to render a component in a test using the render method from react testing library. However, I'm getting the following error:
RangeError: Invalid string length

I tried to render a simpler component (with just a div) and the error doesn't happen in that case.
Does anyone know how to fix that? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
