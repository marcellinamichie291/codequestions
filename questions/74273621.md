# How to define a regular expression for checking in Access?

I have created a database in access and I want the value of a field to accept values as follows:
capitalCharacters-numbers
How I can to define a regular expression for this case?
I use Access 2003. I tried the Like ("[A-Z]-[0-9]"), but it doesn't work.
