# How to make repetitive background task in Django?

When I am accessing an url, the view activate a background task that need to repeat an action for 5 minutes every second, but I have an error and this task repeats only once. I have django4-background-tasks for Django 4.1.2.
Here is my code
Views.py
@csrf_exempt
def task(request):
    return _post_task(request)

def _post_task(request):
    demo_task()
    return JsonResponse({}, status=302)


And here the task is, where I want every second to be displayed '123' for 5 seconds, it means during 5 seconds will be printed five '123'
@background(schedule=0)
def demo_task(repeat=4, repeat_until=(datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=3))):
    print('123')

Maybe exits other ways to make async background tasks, I tried celery, but it was too hard.
