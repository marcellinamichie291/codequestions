# (Python) - Looking to find where the same mobile number appears in 2 separate dataframes

Trying to create a dataframe that only contains the records where the mobile number matches in both records however there are too many variables in how mobile numbers are shown which stops Python merging the two.
Some have an email address in this field, some start with +44, many with a O instead of 0 and several with â€­
First tried simply
sales_merge = sales.merge(df, on = 'Mobile', how='inner')
You are trying to merge on object and float64 columns. If you wish to proceed you should use pd.concat

Tried changing all to integers
sales2['Mobile']=sales['Mobile'].astype(int)
Python int too large to convert to C long

Tried that a different way...
sales2['Mobile']=sales['Mobile'].astype(np.int64)
invalid literal for int() with base 10: '07860 750###'     - (Put ### instead of last 3 digits to preserve anonymity)
