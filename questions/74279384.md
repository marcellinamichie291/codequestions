# Figures in Matplotlib

There is something I don't get about figures in matplotlib.pyplot. When I call plt.savefig() for example, the pyplot library saves the image in a path that I give it as a parameter, however I don't have to give savefig() the actual important parameter figure, it just saves it without having the figure as an argument. How is this? Are figures in matplotlib some form of global singletons?
