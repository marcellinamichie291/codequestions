# how to remove similar coordinates from two dataframes

I have two sets of data which contain coordinates. I want to remove the similar coordinate from "DATA.xlsx".
you can download the data from
DATA
I used this code to do that:
b1 = read_excel('DATA.xlsx')
d1 = read_excel('data2.xlsx')
b1 = b1[!(b1$y %in% d1$y),]

I does the job but the problem is since it only uses one variable to do so, sometimes it gives me different results because sometimes I have two y coordinates and removes the wrong row. I tried with x coordinates too. It has the same problem. I want to modify the code in a way to use both x coordinate and y coordinate then match the data from the two files and remove them.
