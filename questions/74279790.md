# Why in kotlin "something != null || return" does not perform smartcast, but "if (something == null) return" yes

Given a function. for example:
suspend fun getUser(userId: Int): User? {
    val result: UserApiResult? = fetchTheApi(userId)

    //result != null || return null    // Not smartcast
    if (result == null) return null    // Will make an smartcast of result from UserApiResult? to UserApiResult

    return User(result.email, result.name) 
}

Inside my IDE, specifically Android Studio. The first condition won't perform a smartcast even though it visibly does the same thing as the second condition (unless it's doing some dark things under the hood).
