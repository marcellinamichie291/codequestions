# WebSocket connection failed ERROR on Production (React 18.2.0)

I've got this error after building my project to a live server. It appears after 20-30 seconds after the page loads (any page).
Everything works just fine on my localhost.

I tried to create .env file WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0 in the same folder with package.json but it didn't help.
