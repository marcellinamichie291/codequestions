# Roslyn: Add Alias To Namespace And Refactor All Associated Code

We are in the process of making a tool that refactors a big pile of VB.NET code. During the refactoring process, we discovered that there are many conflicts between some new namespaces we added and some classes from imported assemblies. We want to introduce aliases to our imports and refactor all code that is affected with the alias.
For example:
Imports Internal.Framework.Security
Imports Internal.Framework.DataAccess
Imports Internal.Framework.Web

Partial Class TestClass
    Inherits ilotControl

    Private usrInfo As UserInfo = UserInfo.GetUserInfo

    Sub InsertData()
        Dim SQL As New IlotDataClient
        SQL.OpenConnection(Configuration.GetConnectionString(0))
        SQL.BeginTrans()
        SQL.CloseConnection()
    End Sub

End Class

Must become:
Imports frameworkSecurity = Internal.Framework.Security
Imports dao = Internal.Framework.DataAccess
Imports web = Internal.Framework.Web

Partial Class TestClass
    Inherits web.ilotControl

    Private usrInfo As frameworkSecurity.UserInfo = frameworkSecurity.UserInfo.GetUserInfo

    Sub InsertData()
        Dim SQL As New dao.IlotDataClient
        SQL.OpenConnection(dao.Configuration.GetConnectionString(0))
        SQL.BeginTrans()
        SQL.CloseConnection()
    End Sub

End Class

Most progress I have made is identifying which symbols should be refactored, but I haven't figured out how a smooth refactoring can take place. Any ideas ?
