Got this error message when trying to run my VBA macros. I tried to declare a new variable which is just a simple integer, but I still get this error even though declaring it in the Module, Userform, Excel Sheet and Sub-Userform. Any tips?
What I'm expecting is just a simple variable that I can add into other formulas to give me the result in the userform.
