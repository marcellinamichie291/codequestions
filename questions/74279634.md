# json.dumps not correctly recognizing dictionary

Here's the relevant code:
  print(type(document))
  myjson = json.dumps( document )


Here's what I get:
<class 'dict'>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./monitor.py", line 965, in <module>
    myjson = json.dumps( nft )
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/json/__init__.py", line 231, in dumps
    return _default_encoder.encode(obj)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/json/encoder.py", line 199, in encode
    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/json/encoder.py", line 257, in iterencode
    return _iterencode(o, 0)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/json/encoder.py", line 179, in default
    raise TypeError(f'Object of type {o.__class__.__name__} '
TypeError: Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable


So type() thinks its a dict, which it is but dumps() thinks its a Decimal.  Now what?
I tired assigning it to another variable thinking it was the name that was throwing things.  No difference.  type() thinks its a dict, dumps() thinks its a Decimal.
