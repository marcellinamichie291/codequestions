# length of the first column in cvs

I am new in python. I would like to ask what is the optimal way of getting length on the first column of cvs file in python ? I tried this, but got this error:
File "C:/Projekty/valispace_api/CreatingCvs.py", line 6, in <module>
    first_col_len = len(next(zip(*reader)))
_csv.Error: iterator should return strings, not bytes (did you open the file in text mode?)

Thanks
import csv
with open('export_U43V_WIRKNETZ.csv', 'rb') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    first_col_len = len(next(zip(*reader)))
print(first_col_len)
