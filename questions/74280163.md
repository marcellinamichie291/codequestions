How do I write a query that resets data for all characters that have NEVER won? Using the update.
That is, I have a character A who Won and Lost (and this information is on two different lines). And character B, who just lost. The bottom line is that the request should UPDATE the level of the character (make it equal to zero), which has never won, i.e. character B, and character A should not be touched.
In the table, these are characters under the codes:
Character A = person_code (3)
Character B = Person_code (10)

I can't figure out what needs to be written in the second part of the code to get the correct request
UPDATE Table1
SET lvl = 0
WHERE The_team_has_won NOT IN (
    SELECT
        The_team_has_won
    FROM Table1
    WHERE The_team_has_won = 1
)
