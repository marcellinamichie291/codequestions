# Objection.js - How to get records by inner joining table in Mysql

I have two tables, tbl_users and tbl_organisation_members.
tbl_users has these columns.

id
name
email

tbl_organisation_members has these columns.

id
user_id
status

I want to convert the given query into Objection.js way.
select om.id, u.name, u.email, om.status from tbl_organisation_members om 
INNER JOIN tbl_users u on user_id = u.id;

This query gives given result
| id | name | email | status 
| 1  | john | john@gmail.com | Active 
| 2  | sara | sara@gmail.com | Active 

I already created two models Users and OrganisationMembers but I don't know what to put in relationMappings method.
