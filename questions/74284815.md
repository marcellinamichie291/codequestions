# Unable to access Samba server using Cloudflare Tunnel

I have a ubuntu server running locally with some services running along with samba server. I have already set-up cloudflare(s) tunnel using docker and can even access those using the tunnel. The problem arises when I try tunneling my samba service through it [I can access this service using local IP].
Can someone please help me here ASAP?
I tried verifying port which seems correct.
I have tried using CLI which due to reasons unknown messed up my homeassistant setup.
