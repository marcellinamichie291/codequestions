I'm using the following code to upgrade https connection websocket connection receiving 403 error.
https to ws upgrade
Configuration:
                    match:
                      safe_regex:
                        google_re2: {}
                        regex: "/api/1/(web|rest)/ws.*"
                    upgrade_configs:
                      - upgrade_type: websocket
