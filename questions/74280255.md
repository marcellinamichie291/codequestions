# Fastest way to add a lot of rows in a DataTable

I have around 200,000 objects that I want to insert in a DataTable and show them in a DataGridView as a bound data source. Right now, I'm using this code to insert the rows which takes a long time:
public static void InsertAutomaticDataRows<T>(this DataTable dataTable, IEnumerable<T> objects)
{
    var properties = typeof(T).GetProperties();

    foreach (var obj in objects)
    {
        var row = dataTable.NewRow();

        foreach (var property in properties)
        {
            row[dataTable.Columns[property.Name]] = property.GetValue(obj) ?? DBNull.Value;
        }

        dataTable.Rows.Add(row);
    }
}

Is there any way to achieve the same result sooner? Is there a better way to do this? I just want to show 200,000 items in a GridView. I assume this should be possible.
PS:
This is just for a specific case. I know showing 200K records to the user is not a good idea.
