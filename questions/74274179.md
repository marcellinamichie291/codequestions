# I can't use drand48() and srand48() in C

I'm having problems compiling a program in C using the function drand48(). I wanted to know if and how I can fix this issue.
I've written a program in C which should generate random numbers and confront them with 5 input numbers. I wanted to use drand48()  (because it's the function our professor wants us to use during our exam) but my ide (Dev C++ 6.3.0) keep telling me:
"[Warning] implicit declaration of function 'srand48'; did you mean 'srand'? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]"
even though I've included "stdlib.h". I have tried to do the same on many other ide (from Eclipse to CodeBlocks) and they all print the same error and don't compile the program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main(){

    srand48(1102003);

    int i, num[5], n, count=0;

    double random[100], ran, t;


    //Input

    printf("Digit 5 numbers\n");

    for(i=0; i<5; i++) {

    scanf("%d", &num[i]);

    }

 //Sequence Generation

    for (n=0; n<100; n++) {

    ran=drand48();

    random[n]=round(ran*100);


    }


    //Value check

    for(n=0; n<100; n++) {

        for (i=0; i<5; i++){

            if (num[i]==random[n]) {

                count+=1;

            }


        }

    }

    printf("You guessed %d numbers\n", count);

    system("PAUSE");


}
