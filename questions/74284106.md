# Create list of a list from XML dataset in ElementTree python

i have a question. How can i create list of a list from xml dataset in ElemenTree python? for example i have this dataset :
<data>
    <article>
        <author> Tony </author>
    </article>
    <article>
        <author> Andy </author>
        <author> John </author>
    </article>
    <article>
        <author> Paul </author>
        <author> leon </author>
    </article>
</data>

There is a specific function like :
tree = ET.parse('data.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

for author in root.iter('author'):
  print(author.text, author.attrib['pid'])

that would find and show all author in dataset in single list [Tony, Andy, John, Paul, Leon].  How can i improve those code above so i can get result author in list of s list [[Tony], [Andy, John], [Paul, Leon]]? Maybe theres is a specific function to perform this?
