# Vaadin Lumo custom button theming

I'm using Vaadin Flow 23 and want to apply some custom styling to Button (<vaadin-button>) elements.
I've added a file /frontend/component-styles/button.css where I apply some styles directly to the button itself (no specific theme variant or state):
:host {
    border: 1px solid #AEB136;
}

I've included this by adding @CssImport to a java class like this:
@CssImport(value = "./component-styles/button.css", themeFor = "vaadin-button")

The problem is that this style is not only applied to <vaadin-button> elements, but also to <vaadin-menu-bar> elements, or more precisely the <vaadin-menu-bar-button> elements they contain.  This does not seem to be the case if I specify a particular theme variant or :hover or [active] state.
Do I need to do anything special to make sure :host { } styles are applied to <vaadin-button> only and not to <vaadin-menu-bar-button>?
Update
I've noticed I can use :host(vaadin-button) { } to have it applied only to <vaadin-button>, but I thought themeFor = "vaadin-button" would take care of that?
