# vue-flatpickr-component w/ nuxt

How do I get this to work with nuxt3? I've tried adding it to transpile build, I've also tried adding it as a plugin. Transpile worked closest, but the rendering was all wack.
tried adding vue-flatpikr-component to nuxt.config -> build -> transpile
tried creating a plugin with flatpickr
