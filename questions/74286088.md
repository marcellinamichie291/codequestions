
# Image inside div has extra space below the image

Why in the following code the height of the div is bigger than the height of the img ? There is a gap below the image, but it doesn't seems to be a padding/margin. 
What is the gap or extra space below image?


#wrapper {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width:200px;
}
img {
  width:200px;
}
<div id="wrapper">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/RECDV24.jpg" />
</div>
