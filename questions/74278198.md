# Create ERD About Agent, Client, Policy

I am creating a database includes 3 tables: Agent, Client, Policy
There is only ONE Agent operate ONE Policy
But an Agent can be a Client too, and Client can have one or many Policies.
What relation ship should i put between Agent and Policy?
And How to create hierarchy of agents - supervisors in ERD, Supervisors are agents who supervise zero to many other agents. Each agent is supervised by only one supervisor, who is senior to them (has been hired earlier). Supervisors can have supervisors too.
