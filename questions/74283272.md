# Continue while loop when the function catches exception

I have multiple functions inside a while loop. Each of these functions has a try/except block to catch Exception. Basically, my while loop is perpetual, so if one of my functions catches an Exception, I would like to continue the loop, i.e. go back to the top of the loop. How can this be done, please?
As I have many functions that are called within the while loop, I prefer not to have the try/except blocks outside the functions as I would have so many blocks inside the main loop (or script).
