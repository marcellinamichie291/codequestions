# Where can one find the output log of TelemetryClient.TrackEvent() when using Azure ApplicationInsights?

I have a .NET 6 Worker Service app which is deployed to Azure in a Docker container running under an AppService Web App for Containers. Microsoft has a separate NuGet package for ApplicationInsights, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService, when deploying this type of app and I followed the corresponding documentation here: Application Insights for Worker Service applications (non-HTTP applications).
However, I cannot seem to find the output from the logs anywhere under my app in the Azure Portal. Per the documentation I linked to above, I am using the TelemetryClient class in the following way:
using (TelemetryClient.StartOperation<RequestTelemetry>("operation"))

try
{
    SomthingThatMightFail();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    TelemetryClient.TrackEvent("Where can I be found in the Azure logs?!");
}

But after spending much time digging thru everything in Azure, I cannot find the data I am explicitly logging using TelemetryClient.TrackEvent(). Where does this data wind up and how do I view it? ll I'm able to see are things being implicitly or automatically logged by the framework.
