# cross validation in grid_search CatBoost

Why do parameters calc_cv_statistics and search_by_train_test_split are set to True by default in grid search CatBoost?
I don't get the sense: we choose the best values by mean score on each fold in cv, why do wee need to choose them then on test split?
Tried default parameters and different values for cv, don't get how the parameters in grid search exactly chosen
