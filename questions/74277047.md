# VSCode C "pthread: No such file or directory"

I have this coursework to implement an algorithm using parallel computing in a shared memory architecture. I have to use C and the pthread library. I'm using VSCode as my IDE and I'm on Windows 11. I followed Microsofts tutorial on how to install gcc and mingw. Everything was working fine and I was able to include pthread in my .c file and program and compile away. But for some reason, I am now getting the following error 'cannot open source file: "pthread"' from the C/C++ Intellisense and 'pthread: no such file or directory" from gcc. I have not updated or touched gcc, g++, gdb, mingw, or MSYS2 so I do not know why I'm getting this error. I have tried a bunch of solutions; some more tedious and ridiculous than others, but nothing has worked.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
