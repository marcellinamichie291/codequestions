# Multiple recursive calls in function

im trying to understand how multiple calls work it implement first call until it ends
the condition or it implement the first call then second call in parallel
    public  void re(int x) { 
        if (x > 1) { 
         re(x-1); //3 //2 //1   
         re(x-1);  
         System.out.print(x+" ");
        }  
         
     }
