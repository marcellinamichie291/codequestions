$blocked = array_filter(check_user_blocked($session_user)); if(is_array($blocked) && !empty($blocked)) foreach ($blocked as $key => $fn) {
                 
                 $bl = $fn['user2'];

So what i'm staying i have a total of 2 users blocked so i want it to return the total as 0 if i remove one user from the users block it should show the total as 1 and it keeps shows 1 and not 0 because i have user 2 and 3 blocked.
