# Cannot enable code quality and code climate in gitlab

I have a CI/CD pipeline setup for my gitlab project. It runs multiple stages.
I want to setup a code quality analysis, from what I understood of the gitlab documentation, the config should be very straightforward : Gitlab - Code Quality.
So what I did, first, I added a .codeclimate.yml file in root project directory :
version: "2"         # required to adjust maintainability checks
plugins:
  gnu-complexity:
    enabled: true

Then I added the required include and stage in my .gitlab-ci.yml:
stages:
  - test
...
include:
      - template: Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
...

However, upon running the pipeline again, I still have no code quality tab and both the gitlab template and the code climate plugin don't seem to be executed at all.
What's strange is that I setup the gitlab SAST using the procedure and it worked well out of the box.
Did I do something wrong ? Thank you.
