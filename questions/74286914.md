# In MongoDB how to query an embeded array which has same key name

{'_id': 103, 'name': 'Fleta Duplantis', 'scores': [{'score': 84.37799696030743, 'type': 'exam'}, {'score': 15.95792143439528, 'type': 'quiz'}, {'score': 77.80745176713172, 'type': 'homework'}]}
like this i have 200 documents
in this i need to calculate average for each test type and also need to check if the score is above 40 in each category
db.Stumarks.find({'scores':{'$elemMatch':{'type':'exam','score':{'$gte':40}}}})
i tried this, i am getting for one category. but i couldn't store this result in separate collection using $out command
