# How to trace `window is not defined` errors at build time in NextJS apps?

I'm trying to migrate an enterprise app (can't share code) from Create React App to NextJS (with TypeScript).
I've been able to replace the React Router with Next Routes/Pages, but I'm encountering this error message every time I try to build the app:
Error occurred prerendering page "/". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
ReferenceError: window is not defined

I've gone into the code and, everywhere that window appears, wrapped that code in an if check (if(typeof window !== 'undefined')). But I am still getting this error.
Is there any advice on how best to track down window references and make them NextJS compliant? Any "gotchas" that other folks have experienced?
