# Charles SSL throttle specific path or url

I got Charles working, and I know how to use it. I've done throttling before for the entire domain, but I have a need to throttle a specific path or url.
For reference, I can throttle this: https://www.example.com
What I want to throttle is: https://www.example.com/api
When I enter a / in Charles throttle settings it complains about an invalid url, and it doesn't have a field for just "path" like it does for rewrite.
Is it possible to do this? If not, any suggestion on an app I can use to throttle mobile app traffic?
Thanks!
