# SSIS - Error Output doesn't contain the value which is erroring

I have a source connection which is a ADO.NET MySql, I execute a stored procedure on MYSQL connection which gives me the data set, as we know SSIS tries to read the data from few rows and define the metadata when I run this procedure it defines the data based on data which it receives, however I run this procedure  in loops for different sites (server and connection details are parameterized) columns and data types are same for all the sites, since SSIS reads only few columns while defining the metadata it doesn't get the data length and precision's correctly and they error out at the source connection itself, I am writing these errors to the flat file to process them later, when SSIS writes the error it replaces actual value with NULL.
For Example for  column which is defined as Numeric(4,2) when it encounters the values such as 243.32 instead of writing the actual value to error file it writes a NULL value.
Is there anyway we can make SSIS write the actual value to the error file, Below is the Job Flow, Appreciate any inputs on how we can handle this,

Explained in the details of the problem
