# Adding a conditional in a switch case

I have a large switch case with a bunch of conditions. I want to only use a specific case depending on a boolean and i'm trying to figure out how to apply this case when the boolean is true. Below is the code example.
bool creditMemoParameter = false;
// logic that updates creditMemoParameter

switch (tid)
{
    case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforHomeownerCredits:
    // a bunch of other cases...
    case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforOperatingInterest:
    // Add a case for the following:
    // case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforCreditMemos:
    // Only if creditMemoParameter is true
        sql = $"select 0 as ID, '(Choose an Account)' as Descr union all select GLAccountID as ID, (Code + ' - ' + Descr) as Descr from vAssocGL where isnull(associd,0) in (0, {v}) order by Descr";
        break;
}

My thought was using a when clause to it, but unsure if this would work. Something like:
bool creditMemoParameter = false;
// logic that updates creditMemoParameter

switch (tid)
{
    case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforHomeownerCredits:
    // a bunch of other cases...
    case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforOperatingInterest:
    case (int)EE.GLSettings.GLforCreditMemos when creditMemoParameter:
        sql = $"select 0 as ID, '(Choose an Account)' as Descr union all select GLAccountID as ID, (Code + ' - ' + Descr) as Descr from vAssocGL where isnull(associd,0) in (0, {v}) order by Descr";
        break;
}


Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this?
