# How to set up user input asking for a list one at a time?


I am trying to replicate this python code but I am unsure how to go about asking for a user inputted list one at a time and then how to present the list in order and then randomly. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it
total = 0
while True:
    List = input('Enter an item or "done" to stop entering items: ')
    if List == 'done':
        break
print(List)


This was my original idea but I don't think it makes any sense
