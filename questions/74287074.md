# ASCII or ANSI with Unicode (UTF-16)

I am a very stupid Programme Manager and I have a client requesting us to send in either ASCII or ANSI encoding format.
Our programmers has used Unicode (UTF-16), so my question is if Unicode (UTF-16) is compatible with ASCII or ANSI? Or am I understanding this incorrectly? Are we to change encoding or?
We haven't tried anything yet.
