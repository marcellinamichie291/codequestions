# React PWA develop on real device

I have some strange differences between Android and IOS and I would like to run the application directly from my mobile device and have in there Inspect Mode like Chrome.
I know I have that in React Native, I would like something like that but I cant find a solution.
I have tried everything, also on my iPhone there isnt developer mode, I dont know why.
Saw a replay in StackOverflow that it is hidden and it would be visible if I connect my phone to a xCode project that I dont have on my windows laptop.
