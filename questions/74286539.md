In a templated derived class, why do I need to qualify base class member names with "this->" inside a member function?

I'm trying to write a class that inherites std::vector, and holds my own data objects, like below:
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
class Data {
    T data;
public:
    void print() { cout << data << endl; }
};

template<class T>
class Container : public std::vector<Data<T>>
{
public:
    void f() {
        cout << data() << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Container<int> si;
    si.push_back(Data<int>());
    return 0;
}

It doesn't compile, gcc says:
<source>: In member function 'void Container<T>::f()':
<source>:17:21: error: no matching function for call to 'data()'
   17 |         cout << data() << endl;
      |                 ~~~~^~

I fixed it as below:
template<class T>
class Container : public std::vector<Data<T>>
{
    using ContainerArray = std::vector<Data<T>>;
public:
    void f() {
        cout << ContainerArray::data() << endl;
    }
};

Now it compiles and works. But still, I think this fix is really ugly: why do I have to use XXX::data() everytime I call vector's function? As long as vector is father class, why I can't call it directly?
Does this relate to template class vector, or because I'm inheriting a template class from another template class? I made a quick test to use a normal class to inherit vector:
class Normal : public std::vector<Data<int>>
{
public:
    void f() {
        cout << data() << endl;
    }
};

This time it works, doesn't require that ugly prefix to get compiled. What's the c++ syntax reason behind this?
Thanks a lot!
