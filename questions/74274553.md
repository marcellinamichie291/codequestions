# Is possible to change URL according to what section is currently active with Svelte?

My one page website has multiple sections. Is there a way to change the URL when I scroll to dedicated section? The URL changes when I reach the section by clicking on anchor, but not when scrolling. Im working with SvelteKit.
I've tried some jQuery, but I can't figure out how to combine it with SvelteKit.
