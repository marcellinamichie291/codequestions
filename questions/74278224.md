# Facilitating multisig transactions (Gnosis Safe) via EthersJS

I'm familiar with this flow (via EthersJS):
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PK, provider);

However, is it possible to automatically (transact) with a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet? We have the primary keys available to us (encrypted via AWS KMS).
