# Editing permissions within pg_hba.conf file for SQL API for web map

I’m putting together an SQL API to host the data for my webmap, using the instructions provided here: http://132.72.155.230:3838/js/setting-up-an-sql-api.html
I’ve set up a cloud server, installed postgres and Post GIS with data base called gisdb and am now attempting to load data into the database using R /R studio as per section H.4 of the instructions.
When I attempt to enter the following code in R studio I get an error message.
Code:
    library(sf)
    library(RPostgreSQL) 
    con = dbConnect(
    PostgreSQL(), 
    dbname = "gisdb", 
    host = "IP.v4 address of my cloud sever ", 
    port = 5432,
    user = "mysuperuser", 
    password = "my changed password"
    )

Error message:
Error in postgresqlNewConnection(drv, ...) :
RPosgreSQL error: could not connect mysuperuser@ IP.v4 address of my cloud sever:5432 on dbname "gisdb": FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host " IP.v4 address of my mac ", user "mysuperuser", database "gisdb", no encryption
I understand that this means I've not correctly edited the pg_hba.conf in step H.3 of the instructions. Where it states “Scroll to the bottom of the pg_hba.conf file and add a line like this (right after the local rules):
hostssl    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
“
My amended pg_hba.conf file looks as follows but my question is how should it look to allow all IP addresses to connect?
My amended pg_hba.conf file:
    # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
    local   all             postgres                                peer

    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                     peer

    # IPv4 local connections:
    host       all             all             127.0.0.1/32         scram-sha-256
    hostssl    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5

    # IPv6 local connections:
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256


    # Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
    # replication privilege.
    local   replication     all                                     peer
    host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
    host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
    hostssl    all          allb            0.0.0.0/0               md5

I’ve tried adding the host ssl line in multiple places and replacing the exiting line at IPv4 but I cant seem to find the right location for it within the file. The documentation here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html doesn’t seem to have any host ssl line.
