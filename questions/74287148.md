# How to bind a Spring User with a domain object?

Trying to move the example from Spring documentation one step further, I would like to bind instances of a model "Bank Account" to instances of in-memory users. The intention is that two different users should see only their own account balance after logging in.
The documentation is here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/
The user is built using the UserDetailsService
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    UserDetails user =
         User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
            .username("user")
            .password("password")
            .roles("USER")
            .build();

         // (*) <-- I guess here I would somehow
         //         bind an instance of `savingsAccount`.

    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
}

For testing purposes, I'd like to bind an object of a simple account model class to such a user instance. The following shows what this class would look like in a persistence-oriented approach. I don't know how to define it as an in-memory only type.
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@Entity
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class SavingsAccount {

    @Id
    private int id;

    // In cents.
    private long savings;
}

Thanks for any advice.
