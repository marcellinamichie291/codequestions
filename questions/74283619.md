# react-recompose library for React 18

I am currently upgrading React version from ^16.12.00 to ^18.0.0. I think I upgraded other libraries or dependencies which will be not crashed with React ^18.0.0 except one library and that is "react-recompose."

Error statements
When I looked about their library, I guess their latest supporting version is 17.0.2, so I wonder is there anyway I can fix this issue?
