# React SSR load static image wrong path

i have React SSR app. I have folder's structure like this:

I have static express middleware which handles my static and images in  tag
on client it works correctly:

But when i try to get ssr (renderToPipeableStream) my app i have path to my image like this:
http://localhost:3000/d167bb73efa5dba9019c.png

How can i configure it to start processing photos in the static folder?
Express middleware:
const server = express();

server.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/static')));
