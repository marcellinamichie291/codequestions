# What is the better solution to keep indexes active or disable non clustered indexes before running deletion scripts?

We need to do production data cleanup after finishing Archive load. It is taking too long while deleting production data especially for master tables(data range for master tables b/w 500k to 700k records)..It is a weekly cleanup, there will be many records for initial run but later on very minimal data for deletion(b/w 5k-10k records per table) but still taking a longer time..
