# Minecraft Offline Mode(Cracked) Skin Change Problem 1.8.8

I have a cracked Minecraft server. I do all the coding for my server. I have a problem in Disguise. Normally the name and skin change when the player /disguise. While my server was in online mode, the skin was changing. However, after taking offline mode, the skin did not change. I didn't understand why. I think there is a problem with GameProfile in offline mode. I do not know exactly. I have a function to change skin;
    public static void skinset(Player p, String toSkin) {
        final Player sender = p.getPlayer();
        String name = toSkin;

        GameProfile gp = ((CraftPlayer) sender).getProfile();
        gp.getProperties().clear();
        Skin skin = new Skin(getUUID(name));
        if (skin.getSkinName() != null) {
            gp.getProperties().put(skin.getSkinName(),
                    new Property(skin.getSkinName(), skin.getSkinValue(), skin.getSkinSignatur()));
        }
}

This function was working in online mode. But since the online mode player UUID and the offline mode player UUID are different, I guess I can't verify in Mojang. I want to get an idea for this. I would be glad if you help.
