# moving files to new folder in FTP using Python

I am a bit lost. I'm trying to move a bunch of files to a new folder in FTP using python. I have tried a lot of function but what seems to work best is the ftp.rename function. In fact, it works to move only one file at a time to a new folder but it doesn't work to do it for a lot of files (like in my screenshot) using a for loop.
Do you know another technique to move efficiently files in a new folder?
Please help
