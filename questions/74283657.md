# Grab HTML source of web page after selecting tab with RSelenium

I need to read the HTML of the page that appears when you go to, https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/saving-investing/gic-rates-canada/ and select the "Non-Cashable GICs" tab.
The following code used to work but no longer does.
How can I read the HTML source of this tab?
library("RSelenium")

remDr <- remoteDriver(port = 4445L)
remDr$open()

remDr$navigate("https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/saving-investing/gic-rates-canada/")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = "id", "Tab_non-cashable")
html <- remDr$getPageSource()[[1]]

remDr$close()
