# Old NavigationLink to IOS16

I have a NavigationLink but with the new IOS16 I get an alert that says my version was deprecated in IOS 16.0.
This is my NavigationLink:
.background(
    NavigationLink(destination: self.navigateTo, isActive: $isNavActive) {
       EmptyView()
       }
 )

I don't know how to change it.
