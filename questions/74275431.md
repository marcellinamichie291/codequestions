# Prolog Determine if graph is connected

I need to determine if an undirected graph is connected.
for example, I have such a graph (and yes, it is connected. since from any node of the graph you can get to any other node of the graph)
         ------b------
        |      |      |
        |      |      |
        a      |      |
               d------c

so far I have only such logic of the program: defining paths
edge(g1,a,b).
edge(g1,b,d).
edge(g1,b,c).
edge(g1,c,d).

path(A,Z,G,P):-
        path1(A,[Z],G,P).

path1(A,[A|Path],Graph,[A|Path]).
path1(A,[Y|Visited],Graph,Path):-
        adjacent(Graph,X,Y),
        not(member(X,Visited)),
        path1(A,[X,Y|Visited],Graph,Path).

adjacent(G,A,B):-
        edge(G,A,B).
adjacent(G,A,B):-
        edge(G,B,A).

and it works as follows, for example:
?-path(a,c,g1,X).
X = [a, b, c]
X = [a, b, d, c]
but I don't understand a little how to finish this program anyway. I want to define a new predicate that only the graph receives as input, like this:
connected(X):-
             . . .

Can you tell me how it can be completed in this way? That is, I have to check that each node has the path of that other node..I probably have to submit nodes somewhere else in a good way..I'm confused, I hope you can help me
