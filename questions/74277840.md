# Delete or get index number of a node in a NodeList based on an attribute value

I have used querySelectorAll to get a NodeList from an XML document which, displayed through console.log, looks something like this:
0: <ThisNode AttributeName="a">​
1: <ThisNode AttributeName="b">​
2: <ThisNode AttributeName="c">​

Now I want to do something that disregards nodes/elements if they have an AttributeName value of "b". I can think of two ways I might do this:
Method 1: Delete nodes from the NodeList that have the AttributeName of "b".
Method 2: Get the index of the node with AttributeName "b" (which in this case would be 1), then do what I want by looping through all the index values other than that one.
However, I don't know how to do either.
