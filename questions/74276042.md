# Failed while importing component with useState inside layout.js

I'm trying to use the new version of NextJS and I'm importing my Header component inside the new layout.js file but i'm getting an error:
You're importing a component that needs useState. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.
I tried adding 'use client' to the header component but it doesn't seem to work
