# How to align text on the right side of an image in the header


So, I am trying to get the body text inside the red box that I added in the image attached. It seems like no matter what I do, it just keeps moving down.
Here is the code:
<div class="catalog-center-width one-col-full">
  <div class="top-row-grey top-row-white-v2 padding-top padding-side row-v2">
    <div class="row dp-row-flex-v2">
      <div class="columns large-6 text-center dp-promo-image-wrapper"><img src="https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F3vkvwjz9hnng2dhlfwzj2a5lt%2Fpublic%2F1666809704%2F6527-q2retarget-hc.1666809704408.png" alt="" width="529" height="360" align="left" /></div>
      <h1 class="break-word">
        <strong>Get started with Ally Lending basics</strong>
      </h1>
      <div class="sj-course-info-wrapper">
        <h2>Find and start conversations, collaborate effectively in channels, find information you need, keep work organized with channels and keep your sidebar organized in Slack.</h2>
        <div id="purchase-button-wrapper-large" class="purchase-button-wrapper">
          <a class="medium button purchase-button login-link free" href="/checkout/1ycnoni7kt1cn">
            <span class="purchase-button-full-text">&nbsp;Get Started </span>
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="purchase-button-wrapper-large" class="purchase-button-wrapper">
  <div id="purchase-button-wrapper-large" class="purchase-button-wrapper">

</div>
