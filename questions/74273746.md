# Facing with Server problem in my own VPN App

I recently created a VPN App and I added some servers from VPN Gate , FreeOpenVPN and some other sites but all the VPN servers goes offline after a few days. I searched google very much but I didn't found any unlimited server .ovpn file for my app. My main question is that, are there some free servers with ovpn config files to put in my app or not? If no, then how to create my own vpn server for free.
