# How to setup a project with React Typescript app and a runnable server side script

I have a project with a React Typescript app (created with Create React App). I would like to have an executable script in this same project that I can run. Both the app and the script will only run on local machines.
The script and React app depend on the same Typescript module which is a single ts file called algorithm.ts. I would like to be able to do something like this in the CLI:

npm start --> runs the React App
npm run myscript --> runs the script

I have tried multiple things, the most recent effort is to have the script be a nodejs script and compile the algorithm from Typescript to JS everytime before running the script with node. However, this ends up in the following error when running the script:
$ npm run myscript

> tsc src/algorithm.ts && node src/myscript.js

file:///<path>/src/algorithm.js:2
exports.__esModule = true;
^

ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at file:///<path>/src/algorithm.js:2:1
    at ModuleJob.run (internal/modules/esm/module_job.js:146:23)
    at async Loader.import (internal/modules/esm/loader.js:165:24)
    at async Object.loadESM (internal/process/esm_loader.js:68:5)

This also forces the script to be JS instead of Typescript, which I wouldn't prefer, but I guess I can live with.
Here are the relevant files:
algorithm.ts:
import { blabla } from "blabla";
...
export const function1 = ...
export const function2 = ...
...

ReactComponent.tsx:
import { function1, function2 } from "./algorithm";
...

myscript.js:
import * as algorithm from "algorithm.js"
...

package.json:
...

  },
...
