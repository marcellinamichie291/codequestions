I am looking for a terminal on Ubuntu that can separete input and output in differnent windows? Like a split window, on the lift side I type all the commonds, the results will be displayed in the window on the right side.
I ven been seaching for this for a long time and so far I have not found anything can do such.
Any good suggestions?
