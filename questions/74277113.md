# React DOM gives .toLowerCase().replaceAll() is not a function error in Safari versions below 13 in production

I have a React App that works fine in all the browser except Safari and in particular with versions below 13.
Below is the screenshot of the error that I got:

Upon expanding the error below is the error stack tree:


I am not quite aware of how to debug with the build files. I clicked on the file link on the right and it shows a huge file highlighting the line for a second. I can see that the line it highlighted was in the react-dom folder.

replaceAll is a javascript function but here the browser somehow is not aware of that. Kindly help me to know why the error occurs and how can I approach these kind of error which occure at the build level in future.
