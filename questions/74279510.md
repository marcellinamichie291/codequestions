# No tests found for given includes - java testng

I have an issue with my very simple test for a function (computating square area)
here is the func:
package en.stqa.pft.sandbox;

public class Square {
  public double l;
  public Square(double l) {
    this.l = l;
  }

  public double area() {
    double area = this.l * this.l;
    return area;
  }
}

and here is the test for it:
package en.stqa.pft.sandbox;


import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class SquareTests {
  @Test
  public void testArea() {
    Square s = new Square(5);
    assert s.area() == 25;
  }
}

pls help me - what could have possibly gone wrong with it?

i've read that question but i didn't get answers
