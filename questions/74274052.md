# SSRS - Align zero on primary and secondary axis

I'm working on an SSRS Chart and I have two Y-axis. The primary is a number which includes negative value. The secondary is a percentage with only positive values. Now, my problem is the zeros on both axis don't align. Is there anyway I can make it possible?
