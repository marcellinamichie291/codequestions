# Nested template argument deduction

I have some function that is templated on output type. This function then accepts an input argument that in its turn is templated on the output type. I do not want to specify the output type twice as that just clutters the api. In my world, I have told the compiler everything it needs to know to deduce this correctly but I cannot get it to work. Suggestions?
template<typename T>
struct TestStruct {};


template<typename T, template<typename> class U>
T testFunc(U<T> arg)
{
  return T{0};   
}

int main()
{
    testFunc<double>(TestStruct<double>{}); // Compiles
    testFunc<double>(TestStruct{});         // Does not compile  
}
