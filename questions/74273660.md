# How to convert a function to a recursive function

Hey guys I don't know if I can ask this but I'm working on the original files in google collab and I wrote a function that  sums all the sizes of the file
import os
def recls_rtsize(argpath):
  sumsize = 0
  for entry in os.scandir(argpath):
    path= argpath+'/'+entry.name
    size= os.path.getsize(path)
    sumsize+=size
  return sumsize
print("total:",recls_rtsize('/var/log'))

But I need a way to make this function a recursive function or if there is some kind of formula or idea to convert no-recursive into recursive
