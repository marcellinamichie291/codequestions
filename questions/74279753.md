# git how to fix directory with two file name identical under windows

We have a project which is used by dev under linux and also by dev under windows.
Now someone under linux created two files: file1.cpp and File1.cpp in the same directory.
they are identical, now when I checkout the branch under windows,  it automatically tells me that File1.cpp and file1.cpp have been modified.
How can I get rid of file1.cpp and keep File1.cpp ?
if it can be done from windows it would be best, because this problems only affect dev working under windows, and they do not have all access to a linux machine.
