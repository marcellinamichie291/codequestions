# NEAR Protocol Total Transaction Fees Calculation

Hi I was wondering how to calculate the total amount of transaction fees paid on NEAR.
According to the Nomicon docs, The total transaction fee is the sum of the following:

A fee for creation of the receipt
A fee for every action

But to determine the actual fee in $NEAR, I need to multiply the above to the gas price which changes every block.
So basically I get the below:
gas_price * (fee_for_creation_of_receipt + fee_for_every_action)

Now, what is confusing to me is that the fact that NEAR distributes 30% of their fees to the smart contract creators. Does this mean I only get 70% of all transaction fees if I follow the above equation?
I tried to explain how NEAR Protocol charges gas fees and wanted to get an answer if I should consider the 30% distribution to smart contract creators.
