Is there a way to zero fresh anonymous mmap()'ed pages in one run ? Usually zeroing the pages from usespace incurs one page-fault per page where the kernel assigns a physical page. It would be nice to advice the kernel that a row of pages will be accessed shortly, thereby enforcing that the pages are allocated phyically and zeroed with one kernel-call.
