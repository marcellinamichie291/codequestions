# awk newline error but only when run inside of bash function

I am trying to run a shell command to get the ip of the computer that I am SSHing into as
/sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $7;exit}'

and this works when I run it in the command line. It would be convenient to write an alias or function of this in order to call it quickly, so I defined one in my .bashrc as
function my_ip(){
        /sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $7;exit}'
}
my_ip

but when I run this, I get an error
awk: cmd. line:1: {print
awk: cmd. line:1:       ^ unexpected newline or end of string

It's not clear to me why this doesn't function since I'm not extremely familiar with how bash functions or how awk works.
Replacing the single quotes around the awk argument, or placing quotes around the variable $7, or putting a semicolon after the entire command dont seem to change the newline error
