# count the arrays in a large array

I wrote the following code but when the rows are large it is slow
    import numpy as np

    array = np.array([
                       [1,2],[1,2],[2,3],
                       [1,2],[2,3],[5,2]])
    d={}
    for l in array:
        t = tuple(l)
        if t in d:
            d[t]+=1
        else:
            d[t]=1
    print(d)


result:
`{(1, 2): 3, (2, 3): 2, (5, 2): 1}`

Is there a faster way to do this?
