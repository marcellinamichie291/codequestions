# malloc():unaligned tcache chunk detected error occurs. error in firebase emulator

I am using the firebase emulator in the docker. + hasura(remote-schema)
When the firebase emulator sends many function requests, the data is not answered after the malloc():unaligned tcache chunk detected error occurs. (If you request a little bit of data, youâ€™ll get a normal response) How do you solve this problem? My environment is as follows.

Docker Desktop: 4.12.0
12 GiB of memory allocated to Docker (average usage 6 to 7 GiB)
CPU assigned to Docker: 8Core
