# How to open terminal, print to it, and close it in .jar application

I have a program where, during a long task, I use System.out to print messages to indicate its progress. However, this can only be seen in the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
When I export the program to a jar file and double-click it, it doesn't print out any System.out messages, although it is still able to do its tasks.
So, how do I make my program open a terminal upon double-clicking its jar file so that it can print messages to it in a similar manner as using System.out?
