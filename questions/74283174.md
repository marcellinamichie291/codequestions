# How to exclude unmatched playbook when filtering by hosts and tags

When I run the following command:
ansible-playbook <mybook.yml> -l <myhost> -t <mytag> -D -C --list-hosts --list-tasks

I received a full list of plays with empty matches (either it does match the host or the task):
  play #N (xxx): Task name TAGS: []
    pattern: ['xxx']
    hosts (0):
    tasks:

Is there a way to tell ansible just to give me the matched play?
