# How to use single loop to obtain the given sequence?

I want to use just 1 loop in python to obtain the sequence like  (likes counter in second  and miliseconds)
0 0.033 0.066 0.1 0.133 0.166 0.2....

Currently, I have to use two loops to obtain it as follows
miliseconds =[0 0.033 0.066 0.1 0.133 0.166 0.2 0.233 0.266 0.3 0.333 0.366 0.4 0.433 0.466 0.5 0.533 0.566 0.6 0.633 0.666 0.7 0.733 0.766 0.8 0.833 0.866 0.9 0.933 0.966 1]
for second in range(100):
   for milisecond_ in miliseconds:
       print (second + milisecond_)
