# Create a somewhat complex kibana date-related query

I am only familiar with Kibana's simple filter related queries, but did not find much structured documentation on creating complex queries as done in sql.
Initially, I have 2 fields: "Pipeline", and "timestamp" that has dates like these "2022-10-06T06:23:49+00:00". Pipeline values can be duplicate but with different timestamps defining when they were actually created. Now, I want to create a table that lists the 5 pipelines having highest duration times. Now these duration times means the most recent "timestamp" - oldest "timestamp" with the same "pipeline" value. How can I construct a query like this?
Also, can someone recommend a good documentation/tutorial to learn how to get familiarized with complex Kibana queries like these instead of simple filter queries?
