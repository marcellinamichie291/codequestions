# Regex to highlight the tags which are not present in the regex

</?(?i:script|embed|object|frame|meta|link|style)(.|\n)*?>

This is the regex i'm currently using to identify the tags which I mentioned in the regex. And working properly and highlight the tags mentioned in the regex.
I'm using this regex on an string  = "<meta> <script> <p>"
But I want that instead of highlighting tags which are present in the regex I want it will highlight which is not present in the regex.
My string is dynamic coming from api response above string is just for example.
Eg: <p>
