# Python Installation Problems

I have installed python on my computer in the AppData\local\programs\python location on my computer. I got the installation file from the python website. I cannot use the installation packages from the Microsoft store due to an authorization error (even though I unchecked the boxes in the App Execution Aliases page in settings). I am on my personal computer on which there are no other users.
When I go into my command prompt, and run the command:
python --versions

I get an error saying:
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or
disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases.

either I do not understand what this error is requiring me to do, or there is something else I am doing wrong.
