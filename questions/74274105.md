# Rabbitmq The message can‘t be delivered from the switch to the queue

Today, I found that the messages of our project could not be pushed normally. After checking the print message log, I learned that the original message was lost when the switch sent it to the queue, and the message could not be sent to the message queue normally.Below is the error message returned by ReturnCallback：
replyCode= 312 ,  replyText= NO_ROUTE
I am sure that the queue exists and is bound to the switch, I'm confused why this happens
