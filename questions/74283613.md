# Rust: I want to get last modified file in a dir

Language: Rust
I have done this already in Python:
file = max([f for f in os.scandir("files")], key=lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime).name

And now i want to get that in rust too.
I want to get the last modified file in a dir.
this is how i read the dir:
let filecheck = fs::read_dir(path)
for path in filecheck {
   
}

but i dont know how to use the metadata::modified function to get the list of modified dates and then get the latest one.
I tried to use metadata::modified function and expected to get the result i want. What i got where errors.
