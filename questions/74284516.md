# Convert binary data type to coordinate point

I have a SQL Server database with a binary column storing a DICOM offset coordinate (which should be a group of three decimal values).
However, the binary data cannot be directly shown on my report using Microsoft Report Builder.
How should I convert the column into readable format? Thank you.
