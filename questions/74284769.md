# SQL QUERY to find the changed records from audit table

I have a table ANC_PER_ABS_ENTRIES that has the following detail -
PER_AB_ENTRY_ID           person_number             action_type             duration        START_dATE           END_DATE           LAST_UPD_DT     
15                                  101                 INSERT                      3         01/10/2022            03/10/2022      2022-11-02T04:59:43
15                                  101                 UPDATE                      1         01/10/2022            01/10/2022      2022-11-02T10:59:43

16                                  102                 INSERT                      4         02/10/2022            05/10/2022      2022-11-01T10:59:43

17                                  103                 INSERT                      4         02/10/2022            05/10/2022     2022-11-02T10:59:43
17                                  103                 delete                      4         02/10/2022            05/10/2022     2022-11-02T22:59:43

This table is a history table and the action like - insert update and delete are tracked in this table. I want to create a query that picks up only the changes in this table by comparing the last_update_date.
Eg- for person_number 101 with per_ab_entry_id -- > 15 , the action_type is insert first, then it is updated and the end_date is changed.
so in the first run, 1st row is picked, in the second run, only the update action_type should be picked.
In case of delete, i.e. for person_number 103, the inserted record that was picked in the first run  was deleted. so it should be picked in the next run.
How can i manipulate the last_upd_dt to retrieve the changes record only in the run ?
