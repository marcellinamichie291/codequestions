# How to scrape a site and get around the 403 problem in python?

I'm trying to parse the site. But when you try to get the page, it displays an error 403. Writes about a problem with ip. Could not find an adequate solution to the problem.
`
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'https://www.avito.ru/kaluga?q=iphone'
header = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:106.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/106.0',
            'Referer': 'https://www.avito.ru/'}

requests=requests.get(url,headers=header)
soup=BeautifulSoup(requests.content,'html.parser')
print(soup) 

all_links = bs.find_all('a', class_='link-link-MbQDP')

for link in all_links:
    print(link)

I read that with such an error it is worth adding a user_agent, but this did not change anything.
