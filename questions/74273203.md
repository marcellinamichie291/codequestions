# With poetry is there a way to quickly check for changes in poetry.lock to run before every command?

I'm new to poetry - not an excuse but rather to set the frame for this question :)
I'd like to have a small wrapper around poetry run which first checks if the associated virtual environment is up to date with poetry.lock and then (conditionally) run poetry install if needed.
For example if Pipfile.lock didn't change, pipenv sync terminates fast enough to just let it run before every invocation of pipenv run, while poetry sync takes more than 6 seconds for me just to realize nothing has to be done at all.
A naive approach demonstrating what I want to achieve would be to write a Makefile target defining a dependency from poetry.lock to .venv/some_random_file and touch this file together with running poetry install every time that file is not up to date with poetry.lock. But I don't want to pollute my project with a dependency to make just for this case of course.
So is there a way to let poetry do this check without additional tools?
