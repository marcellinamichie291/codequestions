# GWT failing with struts2.5.29

We are using struts 2.5.0 version in our product along with GWT(Google Web Toolkit). Later we upgraded to struts 2.5.29 and as a result gwt pages broke and we are getting popup with the error and not getting any logs.
Tried to use log4j2 also for logs but gwt doesn't support so logs.

Not sure how struts upgradation is affecting GWT .
Tried upgrading to struts 2.5.29 and expecting to work with GWT also.
