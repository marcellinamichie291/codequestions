# dayLayoutAlgorithm function parameters in react big calendar

Can anyone explain how can i custom the dayLayoutAlgorithm props in react-big-calendar.
I saw documetation of dayLayoutAlgorithm

A day event layout(arrangement) algorithm.
overlap allows events to be overlapped.
no-overlap resizes events to avoid overlap.
or custom Function(events, minimumStartDifference, slotMetrics, accessors)

but there is no explaination for custom function parameters.
i just find this code from github :
import overlap from 'react-big-calendar/lib/utils/layout-algorithms/overlap'

// rest of code
     <BigCalendar
        dayLayoutAlgorithm={(params) => {
          return overlap({ ...params, minimumStartDifference: 15 })
        }}
        // rest of props
     />

and idk anything about the other params, even from source code.
