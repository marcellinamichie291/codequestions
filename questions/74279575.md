# Add data to pillar from Salt-Runner Module

I have an orchestration file that calls a series of custom salt-runner modules. One of the modules creates a piece of data that the targeted minion needs.
What's the preferred way of providing this to a minion? I am assuming that I should add this to pillar but do not know how to do this from a salt-module
