# How can generics in functions be used to avoid duplicate code?

I have a specific question about the usage of generics in Kotlin.
I want to create a function which takes a generic T as an argument.
It uses that to assign name from one of the classes: Class1 or Class2 to the local variable testString.
Unfortunately this is only possible when I check the type of the argument with the if conditions.
This leads to duplicate code. If I try to avoid that and use Line 12 I get this error during compile time: Unresolved reference: name
Is it possible in Kotlin to avoid the if conditions and use the testString assignment only once when the classes you are going to use have the same property with the same name?
Code:
fun main() {
    val class1 = Class1("Foo1")
    val class2 = Class2("Foo2")
}

class Class1(val name: String)
class Class2(val name: String)

fun <T> doStuff(classOneOrTwo: T) {
    var testString: String

    testString = classOneOrTwo.name //not working: Unresolved reference: name

    if (classOneOrTwo is Class1) {
        testString = classOneOrTwo.name
    }
    if (classOneOrTwo is Class2) {
        testString = classOneOrTwo.name
    }
}
