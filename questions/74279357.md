Hey is there is simple way to show 12 as 12.00, when I convert it to string?
I can't just add zeros, cause it also has inputs with digits, where only one 0 need to be added.
Some inputs and there espected outputs:

12    ->    12.00 
1.3   ->    1.30
0.2   ->    0.2
3.454 ->    3.45


I have tried this:
String.Format("{0:0.00}", Regex.Replace(VerkaufspreisInput.Text, 12);
Output 12
It's the wrong function.
Thanks for help!
