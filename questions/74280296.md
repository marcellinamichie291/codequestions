# How can i replace a type of variable for creating it with a string, eg : (string) (name_of_variable) with char* string = (int or char* or double)

I need a way to create variable with type (my_string) for a va_arg use, i could do thousand of ifs but i need to respect my school's coding style. It would help me a lot the know if this is actually possible, or if there is a way to make that easily, and other way for this would be a type of variable that can store barely all types that printf support.
already made a fonction pointers array if there is only the flag, else haven't tried anything except trying something like
char *string = "int";
string variable = 5;


but didn't work.
