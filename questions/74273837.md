I need convert an svg html element to a ".svg" file
I have tried creating a text file pasting the svg code into the text file then changing the extension on the text file to ".svg".
Opening the svg file in the browser shows the error below.
This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.
<svg class="shape-section__shape" width="1440" height="124" viewBox="0 0 1440 84" fill="#c4e0fd" preserveAspectRatio="none">
<path d="M0 83C454.33-24.774 928.696-27.898 1384.99 71.96L1440 83v2H0Z" fill="#c4e0fd"/>
</svg>
