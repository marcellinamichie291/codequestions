I'm sorry that I have never see or used an actual device with android OS such as Google pixcel, but I found that gray-out area on top of screen like screen shot below.
*This is "Pixcel 4 API 30 mobile emulator" called from vsCode.

And I found this kind of dead area on Pixcel 5 emulator as well, but am not sure that this is somthing in common for all android OS.
Finally, I'd like to ask that if I should avoid something to display here or this is only emulator matters and do not have to care about this ?
In case that  I have to care this area with developing by flutter, should I intentionally separate code or design between these kind of device and the others, as I'm usually using Iphone emulator and actual machine but have never seen this area and beleive I need not to care this kind of area and adopting top-margin for this problem.
Thanks for your helpful comment.
