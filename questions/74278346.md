# How to allow Typescript in the Dev Console to avoid Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'

Testing a block of Typescript code in the Chrome/Edge Dev Console throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':':

I am not expecting it to understand Typescript - ignoring it would be fine.
It would be nice to be able to copy/paste snippits of TS code without having to reformat them as pure JS.
Is there any way to do this?
