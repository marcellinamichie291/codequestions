# Unity editor freezes on play [SOLVED]

The unity editor broke for me recently.
When I try to play my unity project, the entire editor freezes. This is strange because I haven't made any recent changes. All I have done is add a lot of comments. (Some on all my scripts!)
I've tried installing a newer version of the editor, restarting my computer, and testing out different scenes.
Any other projects run just fine. Does anyone know what's happening and how to fix it?
