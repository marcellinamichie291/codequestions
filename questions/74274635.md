# Linear Program in Python with 2-dimensional variable matrix

I'm trying to solve a linear program in python. My (simplified) problem is:
Minimize: ||X*b||
subject to  LB < A*X <UB
X: 165x11, b:11x0, A: 1x165, LB: 1x11, UB: 1x11
X: only variables
b, A, LB, UB : known vectors/matrix
(||..||  representing Euclidean norm)
Does anyone know how to solve such a problem?
I'm currently using Scipy.optimize and scipy.linear.constraints. However, scipy.linear.constraints does not accept linear constraints where 'X' is a matrix (only as a vector).
I'm happy to change package if required.
