# How do you turn off whitelisting in Jenkins?

In this update https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2018/03/15/jep-200-lts/ there was some Security hardening added that has caused problems for my Multibranch pipelines. I would like to turn off the restrictive whitelists that this update added.
I have no security needs in my current Jenkins environment and the environment will be deleted when i am done testing all my configurations.
If it is possible i would like to at least remove whitelisting security in my Jenkins environment, However if it is possible to disable all hardening at once i would be fine with that solution too.
My specific issue is that i get the error "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Refusing to marshal com.google.gerrit.extensions.common.LabelInfo for security reasons; see https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/" when i try to run docker agents in my MultiBranch Pipeline script. I have verified that there is nothing wrong with my JenkinsFile as it worked perfectly fine when i ran it from a regular Pipeline.
The goal of my MultiBranch pipeline is to add a Gerrit repo to a docker, compile it in the docker, And then automaticaly verify the Gerrit commit if the pipeline finished without errors. As it stands, This doesnt work due to the error i described earlier.
