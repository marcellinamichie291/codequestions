# Webpack CSS Loader/ PostCSS Loader Build Error

I have set up webpack myself for my reactjs projects and have run into an issue I can't seem to find an answer to. I'm using bootstrap and wanted to expand their style system with the utilities api, but get an unknown word error when trying to build the project.
Here is the error:
Compiled with problems:X

ERROR in ./src/styles.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js??ruleSet[1].rules[1].use[2]!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/styles.scss)

Module build failed (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js):

My webpack config for css related stuff:
  {
        test: /\.(s(a|c)ss|css)$/,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "postcss-loader",
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                plugins: () => [require("autoprefixer")],
              },
            },
          },
          "sass-loader",
        ],
      },

The changes I made with the utilites api:
@import "bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "bootstrap/scss/maps";
@import "bootstrap/scss/mixins";
@import "bootstrap/scss/utilities";

$utilities: map-merge(
  $utilities,
  (
    "width": (
      values: (
        fit: fit-content,
        max: max-content,
      ),
    ),
  )
);

@import "bootstrap/scss/utilities/api";


How I imported the above changes into my styles.scss:
@import "./scss/utilities/sizing";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";

I already tried to remove the postcss loader, but then the css loader throws the same error. Online I can't seem to find any information relating to my issue.
