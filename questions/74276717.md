# Windows 10 default app by file type .py to anaconda3 pythonw.exe not starting python

I used the instructions in section 3.3.4 Executing Scripts to change the file type .py
assoc .py=Python.File
ftype Python.File=C:\Path\to\pythonw.exe "%1" %*

When I type myscript.py in CMD window, it opens a window to select the default app. The default app icon for .py changed, it used to look like this:  and now looks like this:  The .pyc icon has the rocket ship and the .py does not, but it did before I changed the association.
Before when I type python on the command line, it opened the python console. Now it opens the Microsoft Store asking me to install python.
I want to be able to run the pythonw.exe for my python script using the .py file type in the command window and in the Jupyter Lab Power Shell terminal, I get:
****myscript.py : The term 'myscript.py' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file,

How can I reset the .py file type? How do I change it so that it runs myscript.py from the command line?
