# FTP put file to a new file name Unix script

I have a unix script that put files to a new directory. Is there a command to rename the file while doing the put? I don't want to overwrite the existing files so I was trying to rename it during the ftp put.
I tried doing this.
put ftpFile.txt ftpFileNew.txt
But the ftpfile.txt is still the one being used.
