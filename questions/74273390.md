I downloaded a new version eclipse IDE <2022-09 > version build id is 20220908-1902. and installed some plugins for open the xml and do testNG testing.
but now, I found the the link of javabean in testng xml file cannot work again. any one can help me resolve this issue. it is a little inconvenient.
enter image description here
 <classes>
 <class name="test.java.com.xxxx.automation.testcase.ui.xxx.policy.SearchPolicyFuntionTest"/>
</classes>

detail is that , when I press ctrl + click the searchpolicFuntionOnTest , there are no hyperlink display and it is not clickable again.
can resolve the issue which open the link in testng xml file directly to bean
