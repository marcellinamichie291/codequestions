# Direct Twilio studio flow into zendesk ticket

I am using Twilio studio flow to build out an extensive questionnaire that directs the users to different endpoints based on their response to that flow. However, I want each of this endpoint to be connected to a zendesk as a ticket so that the person in zendesk could act on this customer queries.
However, atm, I cannot connect the two platforms and require some directions to proceed
I tired using HTTP request within Twilio flow and send body of the flow to zendesk url but it failed. I wanted to use the alternative option of sending the body of twilio flow as JSON and see if can work but I am not able to enter the authorisation parameters if choose JSON
