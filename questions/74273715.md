# Why would an SPO webpart on a modern page only be functional for site admins?

I have created a simple (display only) SPFx webpart that makes calls into a list on the same site as it is used. Standard users have read access over this list, site owners have Full Control. When I add the part to a page, even site owners cannot see it. Site Members (& Owners) are able to see the page (published or not), but the content which should be displayed by the webpart is missing. Note that the basic html is visible, but the data which should be retrieved is not. If I elevate a site owner to a site admin permission level, the webpart then works as intended and data is retrieved correctly and displayed. Note also that other webparts on other pages served from the same library work correctly for all groups.
Does anyone have any suggestions to explain this behaviour?
I have tried: Rebuilding and publishing webparts, new test pages created by the same and other user accounts both published and unpublished. I've carefully changed permissions on the "Site pages" library, the "ClientSideAssets" library and the site scoped app library itself.
