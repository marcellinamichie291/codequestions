# js fetch partial content: Range vs slice

Reading only parts of an url file can be done with Range and slice, e.g.
response = await fetch(url, {headers: {Range: `bytes=990-999`}});
buf = await response.text();
// or
response = await fetch(url);
blob = await response.blob();
buf = await blob.slice(990, 1000).text();

What is difference between both method?
In particular is Range faster, when reading small parts of large files?
I noticed that Range allows for multiple ranges. Is there more one should know (advantages)?
