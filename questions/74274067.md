# CSS button icon transparency

I have a button that has a solid white background and I have an "after" selector which is adding an SVG icon as seen below.
Button Image
What you can't see in the background is that I have a HTML canvas that has a moving gradient. So what I am wanting is the dark circle colour within the icon to be transparent somehow and allow you to see the background moving - if that makes sense. The canvas part is kind of irrelevant, as even if I just set a background colour on the body, I would want to see that colour automatically.
I tried "mix-blend-mode: screen" a few weeks back and I am sure that worked, but I returned to this website after making further changes and it no longer works. I am guessing alongside some code, I might need to manipulate the SVG icon too - so would welcome thoughts on that too.
Any ideas on how to achieve this?
Code below - this is done in SASS so will have external variables:
.c-button {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
    border: none;
    color: $color-primary;
    outline: 0;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: calc(.94rem - 2px) calc(2.82rem - 4px) .94rem 1.18rem;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 9999px;
    transition: .2s;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
    position: relative;
    font-family: $graphik-medium;
    font-weight: $font-weight-body;
    line-height: $font-line-height-reset;
    &:after {
        content: '';
        position: absolute;
        top: 16px;
        right: 20px;
        background-image: url('../../svg/arrow-up-cutout.svg');
        background-size: 15px 15px;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: center center;
        height: 15px;
        width: 15px;
        display: block;
        transition: .2s;
    }
}
