# Can't package a Mac OS X Drag and Drop installer

I wrote these lines at the end of my top-level CMakeLists.txt :
include(InstallRequiredSystemLibraries)
set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/License.txt")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "${Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR}")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "${Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR}")
set(CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR "DRAGANDROP")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME "Project")
include(CPack)

but when I execute the Project.sh script I got this error :
Using target directory: path/to/my/Project
Extracting, please wait...

pax: Cannot identify format. Searching...
pax: End of archive volume 1 reached
pax: Sorry, unable to determine archive format.
Problem unpacking the Project

It's supposed to work but it doesn't apparently...
Does anyone knows why ? I really don't understand...
