# Service running in a different timezone than windows (with a specific user)

I have a service running in windows that is running with a particular user, different than the one that I sue to log on to the server. And the service user, is using a different time zone than the windows server.
I need to find out a way to see in which timezone is the user that is running the service configured. How can this be done from the windows server? to check the timezone of a specific user?
Thanks in advance
