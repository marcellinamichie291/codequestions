# How to query numeric values as string with Eloquent?

After switching to Eloquent, when querying our database the values are automatically cast to numeric data types. This results in strange values like 8.0000000000000002E-2 instead of 0.08. This causes all sorts of issues with our reporting system. Is there a flag that can be set to retrieve the values as strings?
We've tried using casts in the Eloquent Model but that seems to happen after the fact. Adding rounding on the web side would be a very significant effort.
Example Query via DB::select($query);
SELECT (CAST(0.08 as float)) as ex1,
(CAST(0.04 as float)) as item2

The casts are to imply the data is stored as float in the database. These are custom queries and therefore are not using querybuilder on them.
Results in:
8.0000000000000002E-2    4.0000000000000001E-2

If you were to run this query directly in MSSQL for example it would show 0.08 and 0.04 which is what our webserver also used to report. I get that floating point numbers have finite precision but we are looking for a solution to mirror the previous behavior.
