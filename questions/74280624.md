# Microsoft Teams: Company wide contacts list

I have 6 users running Microsoft 365 Business Basic incl. Teams Telephony Standard licence. To display customer names during incoming PSTN calls trough Teams I would like to create a company wide contacts list.
How can I create such a shared contacts list that I can populate via the Microsoft Graph API from our CRM system?
