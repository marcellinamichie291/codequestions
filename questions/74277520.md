# How to independently iterate each elements of python list in parralel

circle_elem = ['abcde', 'fghij', 'klmno', 'pqrst', 'uvwxy']

I want to simultaneously cycle/rotate each element of the above list in place
somthing like:
circle_elem = ['bcdea', 'ghijf', 'lmnok', 'qrstp', 'vwxyu']
circle_elem = ['cdeab', 'hijfg', 'mnokl', 'rstpq', 'wxyuv']
#etc...........

The length of each elements will always be the same
#BONUS: It will be excellent to make the loop to move at varying pace (i.e determine the steps or wait/sleep time and so on for each element loop)
I TRIED:
new_cycled_list = circular_shifts(circle_elem)  
print(new_cycled_list)          ##but its rotating the entire list

        # and
for i in cycle(circle_elem):    #but its rotating the entire list
print(i)

for ii in itertools.product(circle_elem):   #this doesnt iterate all elemens separately
print(ii)

Any better ways to achieve the above is highly welcome.
