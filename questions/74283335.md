# How do I predict/output monthly sales prediction values for 12 month with A random forest Regressen tree in rstudio?

I forecasted monthly sales in â‚¬(y) by using unit sales (x).
I do have 60 datapoints and I would like to predict 12 month into the future.
Thank you for your help and explanations in advance!!

I cross-validated the data.
Train =0.8
Test  =0.2
I did train the model
Predicted test.data
Pruned the tree
Calculated MAPE & MSE
Planning to bag the Modell tomorrow

My question is:
Which formula do I use in R Studio to predict the next twelve month?
Datapoint 61-72?
