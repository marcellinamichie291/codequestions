# extracting a string from between to strings in dataframe

im trying to extract a value from my data frame
i have a column ['Desc'] it contains sentences in the folowing format

_000it_ZZZ$$$-


_0780it_ZBZT$$$-


_011it_BB$$$-


_000it_CCCC$$$-

I want to extract the string between 'it_' and '$$$'
I have tried this code but does not seem to work
# initializing substrings
sub1 = "it_"
sub2 = "$$$"
 
# getting index of substrings
idx1 = df['DESC'].find(sub1)
idx2 = df['DESC'].find(sub2)
 
# length of substring 1 is added to
# get string from next character
df['results'] = df['DESC'][idx1 + len(sub1) + 1: idx2]

I would appreciate your help
