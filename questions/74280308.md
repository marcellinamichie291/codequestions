# How to count the number of cells in a row that have a number greater than 7 as part of the text such as "8 days"

I have a spreadsheet that has several columns. I'm only going to show data from 2 of them here, because they're the 2 that I'm dealing with in this problem.
The first column is IP Addresses. The second column is how long ago the last response was or the last response date:




Address
Last Response




10.1.1.109
10/17/2022


10.1.1.113
10/17/2022


10.1.1.137
10/17/2022


10.1.1.188
4 days


10.1.1.199
10/17/2022


10.1.21.5
10/17/2022


10.1.21.50
45 days


10.1.50.41
10/17/2022


10.1.50.71
10/17/2022


10.1.88.10
10/17/2022


10.1.88.249
6 days


10.16.6.190
4 days


10.64.0.76
28 days


10.64.3.48
45 days




What I need to do is to get a few counts worked out. I want to know how many from each IP subnet have

A response older than 1 week
A Response older then 1 month.

In the sample data you can see 3 IP subnets: 10.4, 10.16, and 10.64. I am expecting to get results like:




IP Subnet
> Week
> Month




10.1
8
1


10.16
0
0


10.64
2
1




I have a formula for the "> Week", but I don't like it. I am not able to figure out how to count based on the number at the beginning of the text in that column. I tried a formula like this:
=COUNTIFS(AllIPAddresses,"10.1.*",AllResponses, NUMBERVALUE(LEFT(AllResponses, FIND(" ",AllResponses)))&">7")

Obviously this doesn't work. It gives me a column full of 0's.
What I have working for the "> Week" column:
=COUNTIFS(AllIPAddresses,CONCAT(A2,"*"),AllResponses,"<>7 days",AllResponses,"<>6 days",AllResponses,"<>5 days",AllResponses,"<>4 days",AllResponses,"<>3 days",AllResponses,"<>2 days",AllResponses,"<>Today",AllResponses,"<>Yesterday")

But like I said, I don't like it as it is just looking at the column and not counting 8 of the options. I would prefer if I could have a way to get it to look at the column and count those whose number of days is > 7. Something simple would be great, but something that is shorter and/or simpler than what I have I'll take. And I cannot reuse that effectively for the "> month" result because then I'd have to list some 30 different options that I don't want to count.
It would be better to have it look for the 1 option that I do want.
I'm hoping for something like:

First COUNTIFS counts all the text that have a number > 7
Second COUNTIFS counts all the dates that are more than 7 days before today

=COUNTIFS(AllIPAddresses, CONCAT(A2,"*"),AllResponses, LEFT(AllResponse,2)&">7")+COUNTIFS(AllIPAddresses, CONCAT(A2,"*"),AllResponses,"<"&today()-7)

And then I can reuse this for the "> month" by changing the 7 to a 30.
Though I know this formula doesn't work.
Any assistance with this problem would be appreciated!
Some Notes about my formulas
For ease of use I have named ranges:
AllIPAddresses = A2:A700
AllResponses   = B2:B700
(in my formula for > week) A2 is referring to the "10.1." so that the CONCAT will give the result of "10.1.*" to the COUNTIFS
