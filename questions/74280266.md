# Decoding a string; e.g c1d2 = cdd

I am trying to decode a string that can contain numbers but am not sure in how these characters can be detected apart from pattern matching like this.
This is not meant to be done with any imported library functions I just need to find a way to repeat the character dependent on the number after the initial character.
decode :: String -> String
decode [] = []
decode (x:xs)
    | x == '1' = x : decode xs
    | x == '2' = x : x : decode xs
    | x == '3' = x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '4' = x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '5' = x : x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '6' = x : x : x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '7' = x : x : x : x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '8' = x : x : x : x : x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | x == '9' = x : x : x : x : x : x : x : x : x : decode xs
    | otherwise = (x:xs)

Doing this just returns the following:
ghci> decode "a1b2"
"a1b2"

So am not sure what is currently going wrong
