# [eslint][node.js] eslint-disable not working

I'm trying to disable eslint for a line of code but to no effect.
I tried to tackle the problem as in eslint docs. One approach, used in C:...somepath...\index.js:
/* eslint-disable */
const fetch = (url, init) =>
  import('node-fetch').then(({ default: fetch }) => fetch(url, init));
/* eslint-enable */

And another approach, used in C:\Users...somepath...\shared\index.js:
// eslint-disable-next-line
const fetch = (url, init) => import('node-fetch').then(({ default: fetch }) => fetch(url, init));

None of them seem to work as while running npx eslint "**/*.js" I keep on getting:
C:\...somepath...\index.js
  6:32  error  Parsing error: Unexpected token import

C:\Users\...somepath...\shared\index.js
  11:7  error  Parsing error: Unexpected token import

I'm using commonjs, and yes, I know that import is not designed to be used out of es modules but according to node-fetch documentation I can do so and the solution is working fine. Yet, eslint is still throwing errors. After failing to add some rules ignoring importing, I decided to just disable the problematic pieces of code.
I'm extending airbnb and my .eslintrc is as simple as that:
{
  "extends": "airbnb"
}

Relevant dependencies/devDependencies in package.json:
"dependencies": {
    "node": "^16.17.0",
    "node-fetch": "^3.2.10",
    "npm": "^8.19.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^5.36.2",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^5.36.2",
    "eslint": "^8.2.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb": "^19.0.4",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.26.0",
    "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.5.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.28.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.3.0",
    "prettier": "2.7.1"
}

I've tried applying /* eslint-disable */ to a whole file to check whether it works at all - no it doesn't. This led me to think whether airbnb doesn't have sth like "noInlineConfig": true set but I checked and it seems like not the case.
Can you please help me with the issue?
