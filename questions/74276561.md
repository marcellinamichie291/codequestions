# Force vega-lite to show label when number is 0

I'm still very much a beginner in vega-lite but I'm trying to create a stacked bar chart with different sales channels. Sometimes a sales channel has a 0 and doesn't show up, how can I still show the label?

{
  "layer": [
    {
      "mark": {
        "type": "bar",
        "cornerRadius": 50,
        "color": "#90C290",
        "tooltip": true
      },
      "encoding": {
        "x": {
          "field": "Number of customers"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "mark": {
        "type": "text",
        "tooltip": true,
        "align": "left",
        "baseline": "middle",
        "x": 10,
        "color": "white"
      },
      "encoding": {
        "text": {
          "field": "Number of customers",
          "type": "text"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "encoding": {
    "y": {
      "field": "Sales channel",
      "type": "nominal",
      "sort": "descending",
      "title": null
    },
    "x": {
      "type": "quantitative",
      "title": null,
      "axis": null
    }
  }
}

I tried the code above and looked through documentation but couldn't exactly find what I was looking for
