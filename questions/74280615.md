# Microsoft graph api planner task bulk insertion

We are using microsoft graph api v1.0 in our .Net core application from planner tasks crud operations.
Steps we are performing are:

Create group
Create planner plan
Create multiple tasks under above group and plan.

Sometimes everything works fine but some times some task fails.
We loop our tasks list and do post call through graph api sdk for c#.
We get 400 or 500 randomly while creating plan under group on multiple retries, it creates sucessfully.
Some times on planner task post call we get 400 or 500 response.
Any idea how we can do these batch calls without missing tasks
