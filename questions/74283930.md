# Handling third party libraries that inject into the DOM in React

I have a third party library that injects iframes into the DOM at specified <div>s.
My application is written in React and I'm trying to encapsulate this into a React component, but running into a few issues.
I'm using the useEffect hook to inject the iframes after the component is mounted, and I also cleanup the <div>s after  but the issue is that in StrictMode the cleanup doesn't work properly, and I'm not sure why.
Here's how my code is structured:
function MyComponent() {
    useEffect(() => {
        const initializeFrames = async () => {
            const library = Library.initialize();
            library.createField('input', { selector: '#inject-here' });
            await library.build();
        };

        initializeFrames();

        return function cleanup() {
            document.getElementById('inject-here').replaceChildren();
        }
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
           <div id="inject-here">
           </div>
        </div>
    )
}

On initial render this creates two iframes undernear the inject-here div in StrictMode. How should I go about this so that my code is more idiomatic and I don't need to disable StrictMode?
When I try to debug via console debugging the cleanup gets run first before the frames are finished initializing.
