# Eclipse unable to connect to remote Linux via SSH

I am trying to set-up Eclipse on Windows to build and debug a C application on an i.MX6 eval kit running Yocto Linux. When I try to connect either via the debugger or via the Remote System Explorer I get the following error:
Could not open connection.
Reason: Algorithm Negotiation fail
I can connect to the board via Tera Term using SSH and port 22, so it seems like GDB server is running, but there is some incompatibility between Eclipse SSH and Linux SSH. I've seen several posts about this, but most of them are years old, and no longer apply. I tried changing the connection settings in Eclipse, but nothing I have tried seems to work.
How do I configure Eclipse, or Yocto Linux, to allow them to communicate?
