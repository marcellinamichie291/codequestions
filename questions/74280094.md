# Connect an existing azure Kubernetes cluster to new virtual network for timescale VPC

The overall goal of this question is to find out the proper way to connect a pre-existing azure kubernetes cluster to an azure virtual private network (or redeploy it in the virtual private network) so that it can now access the timescale postgres database (timescale.com) that has been placed in the VPC connected to the virtual network.
What I would like to do is take an existing production Kubernetes cluster and configure it to be able to see the timescaledb in the Virtual Private Cloud.
Is it possible to do this with another peering rule?
What I have done

Created a VPN in azure
Created a timescaledb database at timescaledb.com
Created the appropriate service principals, peering rules, and connected timescaledb to the vnet
Created a NEW kuberneted cluster in the virtual network
Tested the connection to the database (failed via internet, succeeded within vnet)
