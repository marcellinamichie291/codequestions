# error with Breezyslam (Descriptor length mismatch)

so I was working on a slam project and using the Breezyslam repo link, I am always getting this error, I don't know where I am getting it wrong, can someone help?
File "/home/robopi/Slam/py_slam/lib/python3.9/site-packages/rplidar.py", line 214, in _read_descriptor

raise RPLidarException('Descriptor length mismatch')

rplidar.RPLidarException: Descriptor length mismatch



I am running the examples from breezyslam - rpslam.py
I am using raspberry pi 4 and rplidar A1
i have tried another repo which uses breezyslam then i am getting this error
File "/home/robopi/Slam/py_slam/lib/python3.9/site-packages/adafruit_rplidar.py", line 280, in _read_response
    raise RPLidarException("Wrong body size")
adafruit_rplidar.RPLidarException: Wrong body size
