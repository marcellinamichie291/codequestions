# How to Print first level columns of a multiIndex dataframe in pyhon

I have the below multiIndex dataframe, and I just want to print the name of the columns: Start, Intermediary, End. I am using this for loop:
for kpi in df:
    print(kpi[0])

but getting this result:
Start
Start
Intermediary
Intermediary
End
End

But I don't want duplications. So any idea how to solve that. Thanks!
