# Hidden apostrophes when importing text file with formulas to Google Sheets

when importing csv file to Google Sheets, or when exporting a table from BigQuery to Google Sheets it adds hidden apostrophe (â€˜) to all formulas, e.g. =IMAGE() -> '=IMAGE()
it seems to be a new behavior, any ideas how to import text files with formulas to Google Sheets (right now i just run Find/Replace after import but wanted to avoid that manual step if possible)
