I wanted to populate the list element with inputs from the textField by pressing the insert buttton. But when I run the program and press the button, the Handler never executes.


var items = 0;
function clickHandler () {
    var input = doc.getElementById('input').value;

    if (!input) {
      alert("Please provide the valid input");
    }
    else {
       let li = document.createElement("li");
       li.textContent = input.value;         
       document.getElementById("list").appendChild(li); 
    }
  var button = document.getElementById('button');
  button.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
}
<ul id="list"></ul>
<input id="input" type="text"></input>
<button  onclick="clickHandler" type="button" id="button">Insert</button>
