# Algorithm to simplify an SQL query over many combinations of values

Suppose you have a set of data you want to query from a database table based on two or more columns and you have various combinations of values from those columns to query over.
For example, with these combination
A 1
A 2
A 3
A 4
B 2
B 3
B 4
C 2
C 3
C 4
C 5

the simplest automated way to write the query would be
...WHERE column1=A AND column2=1
OR column1=A AND column2=2
OR ...

This is accurate, but verbose.
Another approach would be to choose one list and group by that.
...WHERE column1=A AND column2 IN (1,2,3,4)
OR column1=B AND column2 IN (2,3,4)
OR column1=C AND column2 IN (2,3,4,5)

This can also be pretty verbose if the lists are large.
What I'm looking for is a good, programmatic/algorithmic way to simplify this to something more optimal, like
...WHERE column1 IN (A,B,C) AND column2 IN (2,3,4,5) AND NOT (column1=A AND column2=5)
OR column1=A AND column2=1

Realistically, I guess I'm looking for the shortest string representation, but rather than worry about the lengths of column names or values or the other code in between, I'd be more than satisfied with a way to minimize the number of times that values have to be printed, or something along those lines.
The given example is for two columns, but I would like to find an approach that can generalize to more columns.
It also doesn't have to be perfect. Pretty good is good enough for me.
