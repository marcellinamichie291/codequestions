# Can not access GitHub From Java and Jgit

I want to clone GitHub repository from java using Jgit.
I tried with  username , password also with personal token which is created in GitHub developers settings.
Git.cloneRepository().setURI(gitRepo)
.setDirectory(file)
.setBranch(branch)
.setCredentialsProvider(new UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider(Constants.USER_ID, Constants.TOKEN))
//.setCredentialsProvider(new UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider(Constants.TOKEN, ""))
.call();
But whenever I am trying to clone, I am getting this error
cannot open git-upload-pack
Please help
I have tried searching for any solution in google but nothing is working.
Please help me so that I can clone GitHub repository programmatically
