# Hosted UI for Cognito not matching preview

I am using Amplify for a ReactJS app, and have configured a Cognito User Pool's Client to use Hosted UI. When previewed from within AWS Console ("View Hosted UI"), the UI customizations (banner logo and custom CSS) look exactly as configured. But when used within my React JS app, the UI does not show either logo or other customizations. I am following the steps outlined in using the hosted UI:
import {withAuthenticator} from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';


Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

function App({signOut, user}) {

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Dashboard user={user} signOut={signOut}/>
        </div>
    );
}

export default withAuthenticator(App, {hideSignUp: true});


What could cause the Hosted UI in the app itself to look different from the "View Hosted UI" button from within AWS Console?
All other functionality is working as expected, only the UI customization is not showing up. No errors in console or anywhere, and amplify pull also did not change anything. The issue occurs on both localhost and remote deployments.
