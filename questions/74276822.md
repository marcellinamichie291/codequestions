# Getting password from Access-Request in pyrad (python radius library)

I am writing a radius server using the pyrad library. I was able to authenticate the wireless network, dot1x and dhcp. But I can't get the password from an ssh or telnet request (yes i understand that ssh better using by keys than password and telnet is unsecure protocol but i must do such function ). When I try to authenticate for a wireless network, I see a User-Password in the request attribute list, the role of which is played by the MAC address of the network card.
However, when I try to connect via telnet or ssh, I see the User-Name attribute, but I don't see Cleartext-Password or User-Password or anything like that.
Network Device - Mikrotik.
When I set up freeradius, the above attributes were there.
I tried to examine all the attributes in the incoming packets in the hope of getting a password but did not find any. Also I also tried to do what was discussed in this article but I got the error:
`
Exception has occurred: KeyError       (note: full exception trace is shown but execution is paused at: _run_module_as_main)
