# Integration Ovirt and openstack, But got MTU interface error message

I want  to manage Ovirt VM's network by openstack neutron(OVN).
My setup:
- oVirt v4.4.10 (created one VM names: vm1)
  - Openstack victoria (5.4.0)

My step:
- created network 'vlan-1' at openstack dashboard network page.
  - created provider 'neutron' and select openstack networking type

  - import network 'vlan-1' from 'neutron' provider.

  - create nic1 in vm1 and selected  network 'vlan-1'

  - run vm1.

But vm1 start failed, The engine.log show:
2022-11-02 12:05:17,674+08 WARN  [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.provider.network.openstack.BaseNetworkProviderProxy] (EE-ManagedThreadFactory-engine-Thread-11256) [a0d16d0c-f5df-4992-808f-0095daff628a]
Host binding id for external network vlan-1 on host ovn-comp-nodes is null, using host id 192.168.3.215 to allocate vNIC  nic1 instead. Please provide an after_get_caps hook for the plugin type OPEN_VSWITCH on host ovn-comp-nodes

Cannot get interface MTU on 'vlan-1': No such device.
Please, I'm really stumped with this, and I really do need help.
Cheers.


I am reading Ovirt's source code but still can't found the reason...
