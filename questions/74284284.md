The numbers have both incoming and outgoing calls.

the sum of the duration of outgoing calls is greater than the sum of the duration of incoming calls for a particular call_number.


you must order your output in ascending order based on the phone numbers.

create table bill_calldetails(call_type varchar(3), call_number varchar(12), call_duration int);
