# The audio of the file is distorted but in the clipped video - ffmpeg

Hello I am joining 3 video files. At the end the audio of the file is distorted but in the clipped video it is heard well.
I have tried recoding the audio to the video but I have not been able to find the solution.
Code that generates the video with the audio that sounds good
comand_audio_video = "ffmpeg -y -i " + _path_videos_principal_intro + "finaltext.mp4 -i " + _path_videos_principal_intro + "final.wav -map 0 -map 1:a -c:v copy -shortest " + _path_videos_principal_intro + "finalVideoAudio.mp4"

Code that generates the video concatenated with the audio that is not heard well
comand_all_video = "ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i " + _path_videos_principal_intro + "videos.txt -acodec copy " + _path_videos_principal_intro + "finalVideoAudioConcat.mp4"

.txt File

file 'intro.mp4'
file 'finalVideoAudio.mp4'
file 'intro.mp4'

I will appreciate your help!
