# MAUI ListView gets app to crash/is buggy on Android when scrolling

I am developing the prototype for a mobile application in MAUI, just for Android right now. The ListView is not working as expected for me though. Everything is fine when the number of items fit the screen, but the moment there is scrolling involved, the app crashes. The underlying Android error seems to be:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: The specified child already has a parent.

If I scroll very slowly, the issue does not seem to occur. Here's the ListView:
<ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Devices}"
          Style="{StaticResource ListViewSimpleStyle}">
  <ListView.ItemTemplate>
    <DataTemplate>
      <ViewCell x:DataType="local:DeviceEntryModel">
        <RadioButton IsChecked="{Binding IsChecked, Mode=TwoWay}"
                      GroupName="Devices">
          <RadioButton.Content>
              <Label BindingContext="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type RadioButton}}, Path=BindingContext}"
                      Text="{Binding Name}"
                      IsEnabled="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type RadioButton}}, Path=IsEnabled}" />
          </RadioButton.Content>
        </RadioButton>
      </ViewCell>
    </DataTemplate>
  </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>

The item source is an ObservableCollection<DeviceEntry>:
public partial class DeviceEntryModel : ObservableObject
{
  public DeviceEntry DeviceEntry { get; init; }

  public string Name { get => DeviceEntry.Name; }

  public string Address { get => DeviceEntry.Address; }

  [ObservableProperty]
  bool isChecked;
}

What am I doing wrong?
One thing I have tried that does fix the crashing is to set the ListView CachingStrategy to "RecycleElementAndDataTemplate". The problem with that is, if a radio button is checked and goes out of view while scrolling, it loses its state and becomes unchecked. There are also various other bugs, like the list item text disappearing.
