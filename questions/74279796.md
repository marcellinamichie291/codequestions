# Can I automate updating of gitlab runner docker executor

I am new to docker and bit confused about the approach, please assist.
I have a EC2 instance running a docker with a container having gitlab runner service running under it.
I would like to automate this so that whenever Gitlab releases a new version it should get automated.
Is it possible to schedule a crontab on docker level so that it can do the above?
Thank you
My plan to do this
Create a Crontab job on the docker to do the following:
Stop the container
Delete the container
Pull gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
Spin-up a container based on this image
