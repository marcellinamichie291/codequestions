# Typescript how to inherit another class conditionally inside constructor

I am writing a package and in the base class, I was wondering if there is a way to inherit a class conditionally and provide its members when the parent class's instance is created. For example
class A {
  classAFunction() {
    console.log('Class A')
  }
}

class B {
  classBFunction() {
    console.log('Class B')
  }
}

class C {
  constructor(classToInherit: string) {
    if(classToInherit === 'A') {
      // inherit class A and provide its functions
    } else {
      // inherit class B and provide its functions
    }
  }
}

Inherit in such a way that when class C is instantiated all the inherited members are available. For example
const classC = new C('A')
classC.classAFunction()

I am not sure if it's the right way of doing as I have shown in the examples but the basic idea is to bind other class members in the constructor so they are accessible when creating instance of class C in the example.
Thank you very much
