# I have a list, I want to search all the words online instantaneously and simulataneously

I have a list. e.g.

ride
prediction
pottery
virgin
decisive
legislation
core
past
sympathetic
resolution

I want to do an online search. I do not want to repeat this process multiple times, "the process: copypaste one word into search field and press enter, repeat, repeat again and again and again). I want the process to be less time consuming  e.g. "the hoped for process: copy all the words one time, do instantaneous online multiple/batch search". Is there a way to do that?
I am using Browser+Search Engine (Firefox, Brave and  Duckduckgo, Google).
I have searched online and I could find nothing helpful. There were pages describing how to do database "batch search", and I only assume they are not relevant to online search and those pages are too technical (for me).
Hopefully I will find an answer here.
