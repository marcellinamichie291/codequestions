# Sympy Set Theory - How to reduce mathematical expressions?

Let's say I have n Sympy sets defined. The set sis:
s = FiniteSet('red', 'yellow', 'green')

Then I have three further sets:
a = FiniteSet('red')
b = FiniteSet('yellow')
c = FiniteSet('green')

It is obvious that a, b and c are subsets of s.
When I let sympy calculate the Union of those three subsets, I would obtain the s
But sympy gives as output:
>>>Union(a,b,c)
{'green', 'yellow', 'red'}

I would like to get s as a result.
Is there a way to achieve that with Sympy?
