# Is it possible to create dynamic routes in Next Js that can be embedded in external websites using iframes?

I have a Next JS app, where admin users create and manage schedules for their businesses. I want to create a robust way for users to be able to embed a public url from the next js admin app in any external website for their businesses that they might have(eg a wordpress landing page), which displays their specific schedule( A next page that can have any functionality) in their respective landing pages.
I have tried to just link any of my next routes in an external html page using
<iframe src="next app route"></iframe>

I would expect to see that page displayed within the iframe( as it would have looked if I had accessed the url in the browser, but within the constraints of the iframe), but the page doesn't display within the iframe, and I get a blank space. But the same iframe works with a simple ".html" page url that I found randomly.
This related thread suggests that CRA is more suited for this. But I don't really understand how. Especially because each user in my next app, will have a different page that needs to be embedded!
