# Kotlin - Filter list with values from another list

This is probably super simple but I just cannot figure out how to google for that.
What I have is:
data class Post(val id: String)

val ids = listOf("1", "5", "19")
val posts = listOf<Post>(post1, post2, post3 etc)

now I want to filter posts list with the ids list.
This is how I filter one id:
val output = posts.filter{ it.id == ids[0]}

but how do I filter for all the items in "ids" list?
