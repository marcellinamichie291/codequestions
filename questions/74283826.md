# Using Visual Studio, A Windows Forms(. Net Framework) template how to change this POST Description software to make what i will say there?

The Template is Using Windows C# and Dekstop the software i did is in this code; that is located at github in this repository. https://github.com/afjkrtrtr/ReturnValuesFromUserControl.git;
the code that makes the actions in the software is:
var username = textboxUsername.Text.Trim();
            var password = textboxPassword.Text.Trim(); 
            if(username.Equals("abc") && password.Equals("def"))
            {
                MessageBox.Show("Success");
            } 
            else
            {
                MessageBox.Show("Failed");
            }
        }
    }
}


what i wan is that the software instead of making that if the user is:"abc " and password: "def" when you fill the login interface and hit login button there appears a pop up windows saying:"sucess" ; instead it says: "failed"; how can i change this application to make that if you reproduce an audio that reproduce the work interviews for the different project of a company called: new Horizonts; the interview audio file is downloadable in this link: https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=545A361126072FD2&resid=545A361126072FD2%218411&authkey=AA_412lehx8TTMc there appear the next information:RInterview Summary (maximum 100 characters minimum 25), interview date, place, interviewee, interviewer.?
