i am making a movie recommendation GUI with the help of a dataset. For that, i need the value selected from the list by clickng on the recommedation button but i am not able to figure out to do so.
from tkinter import *
import pandas as pd

window = Tk()
window.config(background = 'white')
window.geometry('700x500')

title = Label(text = 'Movie Recommendation', font = ('times new roman',20),background = 'white')
title.pack()

label = Label(text = '**********************', font = ('times new roman',17),background = 'white' )
label.pack()

label = Label(text = 'Movie List :', font = ('times new roman',17),background = 'white' )
label.place(x = 5, y =66)



scroll_bar = Scrollbar(window)
scroll_bar.pack(side = RIGHT, fill = Y)

list = Listbox(window, yscrollcommand = scroll_bar.set, height = 21, width = 40, background = 'white', foreground = 'black' )
for i in df['title']:
    list.insert(END,i)
list.place(x=5,y=105)

rec =  Label(text = 'Recommended Movies :', font = ('times new roman',17),background = 'white')
rec.place(x = 300, y = 66)

def selected_item(): 
    print(list.get(ANCHOR))

# selected = Label(text = selected_item(),font = ('times new roman',15))
# selected.place(x=300,y = 96)

def movie():
    button = Button(text = "Recommendation",foreground='black', command = selected_item,background = 'white')
    button.place(x=5,y=460)


    

movie()

window.mainloop()
