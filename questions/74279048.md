# Calculate win percentage of giveaway based on parameter to compare candidates

Given an array of watching hours of a stream, a streamer wants to host a giveaway. The chances are directly proportional to how many hours someone has watched. If someone watched double the time, he/she should have double the chances.
If someone has 1 hour watched and another has 1, the percentage of success should be 50 to 50.
If someone has 1 hour watched and another has 2, the percentage of success should be 66 to 33.
My problem is how to determine the percentage based on the relation of hours watched. In the previous case, a function to determine it should return [66,33]. But how do I get to these numbers? .
For example:
watchedArray = [100, 200, 30, 20, 6];

Based on that array, what should be the odds(in percentage) of each of them winning?
