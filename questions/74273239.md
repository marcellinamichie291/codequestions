# Swift Combine - Observe change of object's property publisher inside an array of objects

I have a following structure:
class FileUploadCellViewModel {
    @Published var isUploaded: Bool = false
}

class FileUploadScreenViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var viewModels: [FileUploadCellViewModel] = []
    @Published var isSendButtonEnabled: Bool = false
    private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []

    init() {
        let publisher = $viewModels
            // ?? return a single publisher with `true` if all `isUploaded` are `true`
        }
        let isDateCorrectPublisher = ...

        publisher
            .combineLatest(isDateCorrectPublisher)
            .sink {
                isSendButtonEnabled = $0 && $1
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}

let screen = FileUploadScreenViewModel()
let viewModel1 = FileUploadCellViewModel()
let viewModel2 = FileUploadCellViewModel()

screen.viewModels.append(viewModel1) // expected: isSendButtonEnabled: false
screen.viewModels.append(viewModel2) // expected: isSendButtonEnabled: false

viewModel1.isUploaded = false // expected: isSendButtonEnabled: false
viewModel2.isUploaded = true // expected: isSendButtonEnabled: false
viewModel1.isUploaded = true // expected: isSendButtonEnabled: true

How do I observe each insertion into the viewModels array and after an element is inserted, observe its isUploaded property?
I have found a convenience tool to collect an array of publishers, maybe it would be helpful here.
