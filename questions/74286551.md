When I should map Vuex states, getters, mutations and actions to local state, methods and computed? And when I should use them directly in template using store.state.count or store.getters.something or store.dispatch('something')? I am using Composition API with . In vuex documentation they are imported (mapped) to local state, methods and computed. Why not always use them directly?
I tried both of the variants and they work the same
