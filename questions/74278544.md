# Why customer.save() returns None? Isn't it supposed to return objects?

I want to get id of the model that is just created after saving so that I can pass to another view but it returns None even after model being created in database while printing.
view
    def ShippingAddress(request):
        user=request.user
        cart=Cart.objects.filter(user=user)
        # print(cart)
        amount=0.0
        shipping=100.0
        tempamnt=0.0
        totalamnt=0.0
        cart_prod=[p for p in Cart.objects.all() if p.user==user]
        if cart_prod :
            for prod in cart_prod:
                tempamnt=prod.quantity*prod.product.discounted_price
                amount+=tempamnt
            totalamnt=shipping+amount
        
       if request.method=="POST":
        
            name=request.POST.get('name')
            locality=request.POST.get('locality')
            city=request.POST.get('city')
            state=request.POST.get('state')
            zipcode=request.POST.get('zipcode')
            customer= Customer.objects.create(user=user,
             name=name,locality=locality,city=city,state=state,zipcode=zipcode)
            temp=customer.save()
            print(temp)
        
        context={'carts':cart,'totalamnt':totalamnt,'amount':amount}

        return render(request,'store/shipping_detail.html',context)

Also how do I send that id using redirect to next view.
another view
`
     def checkout(request,):
        return render(request,'store/checkout.html')

Is there any way or should i use intermediate page for that.
