I'm developing a small .NET 6.0 application that needs to read basic hardware information like CPU usage or disk size and send it to a web service.
The application should work cross-platform on Windows, Linux and if possibile macOS.
After some research I only found the following GitHub issue, so I currently assume that there is no native way to do this in .NET 6.0: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/22948
Nevertheless, does anyone know a way to read out at least basic hardware information across these platforms?
