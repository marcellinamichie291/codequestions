# Dependencies in an AIDE Libgdx project

I've been using AIDE with Libgdx to make a game. The problem is that when you create a Libgdx project in AIDE the project structure is different, for instance there are no build.gradle files, only .classpath and .project files, which look different. I've managed so far by luckily finding instructions for adding the specific libraries I've needed using the .classpath files. Can anybody explain to me how one would go about translating how a dependancy should look in a build.gradle file to how it should look in a .classpath file. For instance I'm trying to add the Google Play Billing library to my project which is said should look like this in my build.gradle file:
dependencies {
    def billing_version = "5.0.0"

    implementation "com.android.billingclient:billing:$billing_version"
}

How should that look in a .classpath file, or how would I go about adding that to my .classpath file, or my project in general. So far I think I've had to always copy the libraries to my project manually, I'm thinking for some reason I can't access remote repositories, only local ones. Am I wrong about that, is there a way to access them without copying them to the project manually.
