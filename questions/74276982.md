# Mean statistics about agents in Anylogic

I'm working on a family practitioner model, my goal is to model the population of a city and all of the family practitioners in that given city by taking into account the distribution of the treatment time and the arrival schedule of patients etc... So far i've managed to create an agent that contains a bloc diagram to model the whole process

With a source and a delay bloc to generate patients according to a fixed schedule, a service bloc and two sinks.
Now i've put a population of this agent "process" in the main and i've simulated the model for 3 months.

Lets say i've started with a population of 10 process which represents the number of practitioners. My goal now to to collect some Mean statistics, like the Mean number of treated patients (treated patients goes to the sink "Served") of the 10 practitioners, the Mean waiting time of patients at the service bloc, the mean utilization ratio of the resource of the service bloc...
I want to also know if is it possible to limit the total number of Patients (or to at least count them), for exemple, instead of simulating the model for 3 months, i wanna limit the total number of patients that goes to the 10 process to 10k and i want to know how much time does it take to serve all of them. (is it possible with this architecture of the model or do i have to make major changes)
Thank you
