# SQL TO linq in c#

This code is from my sql query
SELECT Branchname
FROM Branch
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT Branchname FROM vBranching 
WHERE Branch.Branchname = vBranching.Branchname AND UserName = 'xCuttiepies');

iwant to execute it into linq c# web api
Its look like this
var Branch = _dbcontext.Branches.Select(c => c.Branchname).ToList();
var vBranching = _dbcontext.VBranchings.Select(a => a.BranchName).ToList();
var ass = Branch.Where(!Branch.Exists(Branch == vBranching));
return Ok(vBranching);

In Branch == vBranching it says cannot convert from bool to System.Predicate<string>
I want to fetch the data that not exists on that different tables.
