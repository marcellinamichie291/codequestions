# Error Code: 2014 Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now

While I was testing a trigger that I wrote , I got this error
"Error Code: 2014 Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now"
create trigger training_session_is_full 
    before insert on acq_training_enrolment
    for each row
begin

    DECLARE max_number_of_enrolment INT;
    DECLARE current_number_of_enrolment INT;    
    DECLARE temp_staff_id INT;
    DECLARE temp_course_id INT;
    DECLARE msg VARCHAR(255);
    
    SELECT acq_person_id INTO temp_staff_id FROM acq_staff WHERE acq_person_id = NEW.staff_id;
    SELECT training_course_session_id INTO temp_course_id FROM acq_training_coruse_session WHERE training_course_session_id = NEW.course_id;
    SELECT max_number_of_attendees INTO max_number_of_enrolment FROM acq_training_course_session;
    SELECT count(training_enrolment_id) INTO current_number_of_enrolment FROM acq_training_enrolment;

    IF(max_number_of_enrolment == current_number_of_enrolment) OR 
    temp_staff_id != NEW.staff_id OR
    temp_course_id != NEW.course_id OR
    temp_staff_id IN (SELECT * FROM acq_training_enrolment WHERE acq_staff_acq_person_id = NEW.staffID)
    THEN 
    SET msg = '-1';
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = msg;
    END IF;
    
end

But I can't find what is incorrect or wrong.
Any advice please ?
Thanks
