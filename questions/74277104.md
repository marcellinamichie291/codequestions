# Pydantic: How to tell if field is declared multiple times?

I have a pydantic schema which parses a yaml file and creates the model from it, this works well. However, we have seen some users declaring the same field multiple times which causes the second one to overwrite the first and we would like to catch this error.
An example would be
car:
  parts:
    - engine
    - transmission
  parts:
    - brakes
    - tires

I'd like to catch that parts has been declared twice in the same car and error out on this.
