# Efficient way to compare large,uneven 2d lists [Python]

I have two lists that I created by parsing two huge(4GB+) files. What I was looking for in the files was ID and sequence pairs. The following is a simple version of how the files were created:


tmplst=[]
lst=[]
for record in file_parse:
    ID, sequence = record
    tmplst=[ID,sequence]
    lst.append(tmplst)
    

The *lst *structure looks like this: (all elements in the list are in string format)

[['ID1','sequence1'],
['ID2', 'sequence2'],
['ID3', 'sequence3']]

What I want to do is compare the two lists by ID by ID. If there is a ID match between two lists, I want to append the sequence for that ID to a new list, else I want to append -1 to the new list
The following is a basic code representation:

list1_2_comparison = []
for i in range(0,len(list1)):
    if list1[i][0]==list2[i][0]:
        list1_2_comparison.append(list2[i][1])
    else:
        list1_2_comparison.append(-1)


Let's suppose list1 is bigger than list2, which means that all of the IDs in list2 are in list1 but not all IDs in list1 are in list2 (at least, in my files that is the case). I have encountered two issues experimenting with the code above:
1.IndexError: Index out of range 
and, when I replace the len(list1) to len(list2) in for loop, it gives no error but:
2.The code keeps running forever and is **never** executed (I am guessing thats due to the large file size but I'm no expert so I don't know if there is a more efficient way to do it)
I hope I have provided enough info for the problem. If there are any issues with my question, please let me know.
