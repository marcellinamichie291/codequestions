# Composer manually dumpautoload

the error come out when I am trying to update or dumpautoload
Class "Package\PackageName\Providers\PackageNameProvider" not found
I tried to dumpautoload but it can not be happened because of my composer does not work correctly so i had copied my project from dev to production manually but still have a problem with some files fetched using old autoload process.
i need to manually dumpautoload those files could you guide me.
thanks in advanced
