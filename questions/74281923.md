# How to provide a visual breakdown of the liquor category (by Category Name)

I did use the code below to upload data on r
if (!file.exists("ames-liquor.rds")) {
  url <- "https://github.com/ds202-at-ISU/materials/blob/master/03_tidyverse/data/ames-liquor.rds?raw=TRUE"
  download.file(url, "ames-liquor.rds", mode="wb")
}
data <- readRDS("ames-liquor.rds")

*Plot a scatterplot of lat and long of store locations.
*Provide a visual breakdown of the liquor category (by Category Name). Include volume sold in the breakdown. Make sure that all labels are readable.
I have written this code so far:
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = Longitude))+
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)

however Im really confused
