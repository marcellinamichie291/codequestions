# DBus Secret Service prompting

Hi I'm attempting to utilize the Secret Service to access secrets in Gnome Keyring.
Everything works ok if the collection I'm trying to access is already unlocked. The problem I'm running into is when the collection/secrets are locked and it needs to prompt for the user to input their password to unlock it.
According to the docs

Operations that require a prompt to complete will return a prompt object. The client application must then call the Prompt() method of the prompt object to display the prompt. Client applications can use the window-id argument to display the prompt attached to their application window.

The Prompt() method is supposed to exist within org.freedesktop.Secret.Prompt per the docs.
I'm using D-Feet to try to find that, but nothing matching that name shows up in either the Session or System bus.


Any idea if this has moved? Or if I should be doing something else to display the prompt?
Thanks!
