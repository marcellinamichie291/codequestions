# C# network scanner unable to detect other devices, think due to firewalls

I am currently creating a C# network scanner, but I have run into an issue where I am not able to detect devices other than the one running the code. I have been following a couple guides as to how to go about it, but even if I just copy and paste their code it runs into the same issue. I have a feeling it might be due to firewalls because of this but if that is the case how would I do that?
This is my boiled down code using just console. It runs through all the IPs, while rather slow, and picks up this device but not the others I have connected. It uses the prebuilt ping class and sends it to every possible device on the subnet.
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Ping myPing;
            PingReply reply;
            IPAddress address;
            IPHostEntry host;

            string iP = "172.20.10.";
            Console.WriteLine("start loop");
            for (int i = 2; i < 240; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello");
                string deviceIP = iP + i.ToString();
                Console.WriteLine("selected " + deviceIP);
                myPing = new Ping();
                reply = myPing.Send(deviceIP);
                Console.WriteLine("contacting " + deviceIP);

                if (reply.Status == IPStatus.Success)
                {
                    host = Dns.GetHostEntry(deviceIP);
                    Console.WriteLine(host.HostName.ToString() + " is connected");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("^non existant^");
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine("end loop");
        }
