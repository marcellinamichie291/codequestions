student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])

total_height = 0
for height in total_height:
    total_height += height
print(total_height)

number_of_students = 0
for student in number_of_students:
    number_of_students += student
print(number_of_students)

avg_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(avg_height)

i tried to make an avg height calculator but something isnt working
