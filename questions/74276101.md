# Walker context could not be deleted because the yield is not being picked up from test in jaseci

It listed all the walkers however the yield walkers was empty.
import {*} with './tesla_ai.jac';
import {*} with './graph.jac';
import {*} with './nodes.jac';

walker nothing {}

test "Testing Flow"
with graph::tesla_ai by walker::nothing{
    flows = file.load_json("master_test.json");
    
    for flow in flows {
        std.log("\n==== Testing flow: " + flow["test_name"] + " ====");

        for step in flow['flow'] {
            spawn here walker::talk(question = step["query"]);

            res = std.get_report();

            std.log("HERE >>> ", step["query"] , " ==== ", res[-1]);

            assert(res[-1] == step['response']);  

        }

        // std.out("#0", jaseci.walker_list());
        // std.out('#1', jaseci.walker_yield_list());
        // std.out('#2', jaseci.walker_yield_delete("talk"));
        // std.out("#3", jaseci.walker_yield_clear());
    }
}

I was expecting to see that it shows all the yield in the list and delete it but because of this problem everytime it goes to a next flow it won't be able to clear context to another conversation. Seems very weird.
