# export multiple files in nrwl nx library projects into apps

New at using nx for front end development. I have the following project / lib structure
apps
 - single-spa
 - standalone

lib
 - business
   - index.tsx

The app single-spa references business. There are multiple sub folders in business at the moment. I have to manually add an entry into index.tsx for each of the component that single-spa directly OR indirectly uses
sample entry in index.txs
export * from pages/page01.js
export * from pages/page02.js


Is there an easier way to export components from lib/business ?
