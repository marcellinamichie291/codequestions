I have a .tsv file from which I've created a pyhton dictionary where the keys are all the movie_id and the values are the features (every movie has a different number of features).
Here's an example of my dictionary:

Goal to achieve:
From this dictionary I want to create an item-features sparse matrix to use for a recommender system project.
At the end I would like to have a binary sparse matrix with 1 when a movie has a certain feature.
Something like this:

My code:
To create the dictionary:
def Dictionary():
    d={}
    l=[]
    with open(filepath_mapping) as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            line = line.split()
            key = int(line[0])
            value = [int(el) for el in line[1:]]
            d[key] = value
    return(d)

movie_features_dict = Dictionary()

To create the item-features matrix from the dictionary:
n = len(movie_features_dict)
value_lengths = [len(v) for v in movie_features_dict.values()]
d = max(value_lengths)
print(f"ITEM*FEATURES matrix shape: {n,d}\n")

item_feature_matrix = sp.dok_matrix((n,d), dtype=np.int8)

for movie_ids, features in movie_features_dict.items():
    item_feature_matrix[movie_ids, features] = 1

item_feature_matrix = item_feature_matrix.tocsr()
print(item_feature_matrix.shape)

Issues:
I have 22069 movies and the movie with the maximum number of features should have 885 features, so theoretically I should have a 22069*885 matrix, but with the code I've written I continue having this error:
raise IndexError('index (%d) out of range' % max_indx)
IndexError: index (614734) out of range
