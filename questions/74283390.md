I am debugging a C program inside of GDB on linux. The C program prompts the user and then calls read(0,&user_buffer,24) where user_buffer is a 24-byte char buffer on the stack. I know that I can send binary data to the program from outside of gdb by e.g. echo -e "\x41\x42\x43\x44" | <executable>, but is it possible for me to directly write raw bytes to the prompt from within gdb? I've only ever seen this done externally as shown, or using python like python -c 'print("\x00\xFF\xAB")'  When I try to type in something like \x41\x42\x43\x44 to the prompt within GDB, it interprets them as ascii chars. This is important for my security testing.
