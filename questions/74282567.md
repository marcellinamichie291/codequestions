# What happens when a variable is read and AT THE SAME TIME another thread MODIFIES IT?

If the reading happens BEFORE or AFTER the update the behavior is obvious, it is not difficult to see, but what if it happens at the same time? Assuming there is nothing else (no synchronization, just a simple variable read and assignment).
from threading import Thread
import threading

value = 0


def thread1():
    global value
    value = 5


def thread2():
    global value
    # What if I want to read this variable and AT THE SAME TIME another
    # thread wants to update it?
    print(value)

    # What if I want to update this variable and AT THE SAME TIME another
    # thread wants to update it too?
    # value = 10

    thread1 = Thread(target=thread1)
    thread2 = Thread(target=thread2)
    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
