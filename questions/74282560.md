# PowerShell not excluding folder

I have a very simple script(or I thought) where I'm trying to use recurse to go through each folder and subfolder and check if that folder has "backup.log" in it, while excluding the OneDrive folder. I tried everything I can think of, searched online and tried the solutions provided but PowerShell just keeps going in to the OneDrive folder. Some of the common scripts I tried are below. Any help is much appreciated.
$exclude = @("$env:OneDrive")
get-childitem -Path $env:USERPROFILE -Filter 'backup.log' -Recurse  -Exclude $exclude

get-childitem -Path $env:USERPROFILE -Filter 'backup.log' -Recurse  | Where {$_.FullName -notmatch "$env:onedrive"}

get-childitem -Path $env:USERPROFILE -Filter 'backup.log' -Recurse  | Where-Object { !($_.FullName).StartsWith($env:OneDrive) }

get-childitem -Path $env:USERPROFILE -Filter 'backup.log' -Recurse  | Where {$_.FullName -notmatch "$env:onedrive\*"}

I tried some more things but it's pretty much along the same logic. I also tried changing the environmental variable with writing the path manually but had the same result. Also tried the DirectoryName instead of FullName.
