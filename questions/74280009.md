# JS code in an href doesn't work with full code

I was trying to make a website showcasing bookmarklets, but one of them doesn't use the full code. I know this is because there's both '' and "" in the code, but I don't know how to fix it.
<a href="javascript:function gcloak() { var link = document.querySelector("link[rel*='icon']") || document.createElement('link');link.type = 'image/x-icon';link.rel = 'shortcut icon';link.href = 'https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/infinite_arrow_favicon_5.ico';document.title = 'My Drive - Google Drive';console.log(document.title);document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(link) };gcloak();setInterval(gcloak, 1000);">
