# Inner join duplicating data when fetched

I only want to get the post data once, but I have 4 images in the other table.
SELECT posts.id as post_id, posts.unique_id as post_unique_id, post_images.image_name as image_name FROM posts
JOIN post_images ON post_images.post_unique_id = posts.unique_id
WHERE post_images.post_unique_id = posts.unique_id

Output:
#post_id, #post_unique_id,   #image_name
'1',      'YBNkqOOn7',       '1667211631_controller.png'
'1',      'YBNkqOOn7',       '1667211631_response.png'
'1',      'YBNkqOOn7',       '1667211631_aaaaaaaa.png'
'1',      'YBNkqOOn7',       '1667211631_ajax_request.png'

Unfortunately I get repetitive data of post id and unique id. How do I get all 4 images but only once in the same value columns (post_id, unique_id)?
Maybe I have to make 2 queries (1 for post data and 1 for post_images).
