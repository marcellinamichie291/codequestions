# why css bottom is not working in carousel?

I am using this plugin to create carousel
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel
but my pills show over the image .see current output (background red). pills are over the image
here is my code
https://codesandbox.io/s/react-responsive-carousel-forked-8c3x7s?file=/src/index.js
Expected output

I tried like this
.control-dots {
  background-color: red;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
}

still not working. Expected to move pills bottom of image not over the image.
