# Array object assertion without knowing it's position in Karate Framework

I am adding user into array using post call and I want to make assertion but I don't know the position of the object I added into the Array and also there is duplicate entry of the user so how can I assert the user which I recently added into array.
{
    "message": {
        "users": [
            {
                "name": "Ashish Patil",
                "weight": "65"
            },
            {
                "name": "Ashish Patil",
                "weight": "65"
            }
        ]
    }
}

this is the example so how I get to know which user added recently.
