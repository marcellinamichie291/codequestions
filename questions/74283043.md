# Calculate Bollinger Band using Pandas

Given a series, I want to calculate its Bollinger Band using Pandas. There exists a prior question, an answer to which discusses only the std aspect of the calculation, but not the entire calculation.
Given a variable series of type pandas.Series with dtype float64, to compute a band having a length of 20 and a standard deviation of 2, I tried:
2 * (series.rolling(20).mean() + series.rolling(20).std(ddof=0))

The above formula however produces a grossly incorrect result.
