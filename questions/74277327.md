# How do I know if I in the middle of key series in vim?

Perhaps I wasn't very clear in the title.
What I'm searching for is a way to map the f key to execute some command, but only if I'm not in the middle of another series of a key strokes like cf<char> or df<char>.
Is there a way to know that?
Thanks a lot!
(I've searched this site and didn't find similar question).
