# refactor methods which use reflection

Suppose I have two struct which are
type A struct {
}

func (a *A) SomeFunc (s string) {
    // some codes
}

func (a *A) ProcessRequest(funcName string, parameters map[string]*structpb.Value) error {
    ...
    if method := reflect.ValueOf(a).MethodByName(funcName); method.IsValid()
    ...
        values := make([]reflect.Value, 0)
        ...
        rv := method.Call(values)
        ...
}

type B struct {
}

func (b *B) AnotherFunc (i int) {
    //somecode
}

and I am using reflection to call methods in A which is SomeFunc and it is working well.
Now I need to write a struct B which also has ProcessRequest which has exacly same code with the one in A.
Is there anyway I can refactor this?
I have tried to create
type ProcessProvider struct{
}

and let A and B embed it but when the method is called, *ProcessProvider is passed as the receiver and it cannot find SomeFunc and AnotherFunc.
An interface
type ProcessProvider interface {
    ProcessRequest(serviceName string, parameters map[string]*structpb.Value) error
}

is helpful but I still have to copy paste the code.
