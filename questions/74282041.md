# How to add a string to a paragraph after a particular word Python

I am trying to insert a string after a specific word in a paragraph.
For example:
If the word I am looking at is King in the paragraph, I want to add Arthur right after it so it will be like:
King Arthur went on a mission

for all the lines that has King instead of
King went on a mission
