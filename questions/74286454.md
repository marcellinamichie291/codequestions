# How to install seamsh in python

I tried to install seamsh 0.4.4(https://pypi.org/project/seamsh/) but counld not.
I spent a lot of time on it.
I needed gdal library to use seamsh.
So I installded it by conda because it was too complex to install it without conda.
But conda was not supported seamsh, so I don't know what to do.
Could you tell me how to install seamsh?
I use windows and vscode.
Thank you.
