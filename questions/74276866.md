# Is it possible to find whether the monitor supports HDR content from it's EDID information

I have the EDID hex string of Display (or Monitor) I want to check whether the monitor supports HDR, HLG or SDR content. Is it possible to find out this information from EDID string ?
I have gone through the EDID 1.3 format and could not find any specific block which provides info about HDR parameter.
