# Get faces of each uv shell on the python maya api

I'm trying to query the faces of each uv shell on a geometry, I'm using maya.cmds but since this needs to run on a callback, I need faster results. I thought about using the api but can't get the same results.
On maya.cmds I use polyEvaluate with the uvShellIds argument. Ex:
print maya.cmds.polyEvaluate('pCube1.f[*]', uvShellIds=True)

Outputs:
[0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L]

Only downside is if I query specific faces it will be slow. I thought about using MFnMesh on the api but can't get the same result.
Ex:
import maya.api.OpenMaya

mSel = maya.api.OpenMaya.MSelectionList()
mSel.add('pCube1')

num, shellIds = maya.api.OpenMaya.MFnMesh(mSel.getDagPath(0)).getUvShellsIds()
print shellIds

Outputs:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I read the docs but can't figure out what the result it.
Thanks!
