# Check if const is valid date

Hey i have a scrip that takes data for sheest and populates a gdoc file
one of the lines is a date
const friendlyDate = new Date(row[2]).toLocaleDateString();

but if there is not entered a date in the cell it returns "Invbalid Date" to the Gdoc file how whould i go about adding a if satement to check if there is a valid date in the cell and if not make the output text "Not registered on date"
I did try different if combinations but i am not that skilled in appscript
