# How can I create a dual axis chart with ggplot2

I try creating a dual chart of column and line chart from a table, but the second chart which is the line graph failed to work as I wanted, I can hardly see it on its own trend.
Below is the code sample and the plotted chart
ggplot(month_group) + 
  geom_col(aes(x = order_month, y = Total_sales), size = 1, color = "darkblue", fill = "white") +
  geom_line(aes(x = order_month, y = order_per_month), size = 1.5, color="red", group = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis=sec_axis(~.* 0.008,name="order_per_month"))
