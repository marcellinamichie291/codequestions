# Firefox backdrop-filter: blur() not working with Sticky positioning

I am using react with styled components and tailwind. For some reason, when using Firefox. The backdrop-filter: blur() will not work. This however is not an issue when using chrome. Not completely sure why this is happening. I remember reading that Firefox was weird with blur, but I don't understand why it will work, just not with sticky positioning, and the problem is only on Firefox. Suggestions gladly accepted
I added backdrop-filter: blur() to the container that I need to blur, I load it up in Google Chrome, its fine. When I goto load the page on Firefox, the blur does not exist. If I remove the sticky positioning from the element, the blur will work as expected on Firefox
Also, I made sure that the blur is enabled in my settings
