# How do I ensure same proportions in any type of screen size for imagebutton in android studio?

I have an imagebutton which I want to have it the same proportion for any type of screen size, so I want to do adjust in size according to the screen size so the all the ratios are the same. I tried to find an answer to how to do this but I can't find anything that explains how to do it clearly. This is my current image view code in my xml file.
    <ImageButton
                android:id="@+id/torchbtn"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
                app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
                app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"

                android:background="@color/black"
                android:src="@drawable/torch_off">
            </ImageButton>
