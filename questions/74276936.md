I'm Working on SQL Database (SQL Server) his main transactions tables divided to four tables every table has it's detail table my task is return all table transactions in one query upon interval value without any affection on system performance (Production Database) returned result may be reach to 10 million
record (report may be run from more than one user , may be at same time)
my question what's the best solution for this task and data warehouse will be Suitable solution for this task or not ?
my current solution for this task is

make another database for reporting and sync it with live database via transactional   replication
create indexed view to query on it
call indexed view via stored procedure
call stored procedure from my reporting app using ADO.NET
