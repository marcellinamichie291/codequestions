# commandButton/commandLink/ajax action/listener method not invoked or input value not set/updated

Sometimes, when using <h:commandLink>, <h:commandButton> or <f:ajax>, the action, actionListener or listener method associated with the tag are simply not being invoked. Or, the bean properties are not updated with submitted UIInput values.
What are the possible causes and solutions for this?
