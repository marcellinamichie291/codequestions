# How do I check if an audio file contains a part that was cut from it?

Let's say there's 2 audio files:
1 - Source audio file 15 seconds long
2 - Part of the source audio file that's been cut out and written to another audio file
Or - Imagine you cut out 5 seconds of a song, now you have 2 files (song + a part of it) & you wanna check if that part exists in the original song file
Is there any way to do this? Can be any programming language or even a CLI software
I tried loading both files to an array of bytes, then comparing it like that, but that returned no match
