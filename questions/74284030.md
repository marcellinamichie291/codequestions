# How to open make hyperlink for txt files


I created 3 text files and I want to create a bullet form list with hyperlinks that will direct the user to each file created. Is anyone able to help me out on how to code this or even suggest better methods?

echo "<ul>";
echo "<li>" . <a fopen("test.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");>Test 1</a>  "</li>";
echo "<li>"  . $filename = 'test2.txt' . "</li>";
echo "/<ul>";
