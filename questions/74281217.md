# How to re-intitialize reactive render values Shiny?

I work on a Shiny app with multiple reactive variables as well as output objects scattered in numerous tabItems.
The idea behind this app is that on the first page you download a selected dataset, through an action button, that will be used by the entire app. After having created multiple reactive values and output objects when the user will explore the app, I would like to know if there is a simple way to re-initialize the application (reactive variables, output objects) as soon as we download another dataset thanks to the previous action button I have mentionned earlier.
In fact, I want to delete the value of reactive variables and output objects from the memory every time I click on this specific button and DL a new dataset.
I want this app to be the same as it is when I launch my code for the first time.

I tried to use reactive values a lot but it has to be done for every variables.
Perhaps, there is a simpler way.
