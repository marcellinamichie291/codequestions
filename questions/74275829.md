# How to bulk download images from a list and give them the same name as in the hyperlink

I'm using this code to download images in bulk, but the downloaded images' names are completely different from the original image name in the hyperlink
from imgdl import download

urls = [
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Moh_%283%29.jpg',
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Moh_%284%29.jpg',
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Rostige_T%C3%BCr_P4RM1492.jpg'
]

paths = download(urls, store_path='~/.datasets/images', n_workers=50)

Currently an example of a name given to the image is "0c807b79bebcf6815816e4cccb6c9bd9c88e77ee.jpg" and I need the image name to be same as in the hyperlink e.g. "Moh_%283%29.jpg"
