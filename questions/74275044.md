# Type of `@cached_property` is not correctly recognised by pylint

For me, pylint is giving back an error E1133 (not-an-iterable) for a @cached_property that actually is an iterable. Wondering if this is a bug in pylint or something can be done from my side to prevent this error from popping up.
Functionally the code runs without a problem. Meaning I'm able to iterate over this identified non-iterable.
# doodle.py
from typing import List

from cached_property import cached_property


class Bike:

    @cached_property
    def tires(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["front", "back"]


front_tire = [tire for tire in Bike().tires if tire == "front"]


When using @property to make a non-cached property pylint works as expected. Raising no errors on the code block below.
class Bike:

    @property
    def tires(self):
        return ["front", "back"]


front_tire = [tire for tire in Bike().tires if tire == "front"]


This is the pylint error that is raised on the @cached_property code block:
doodle.py:11:31: E1133: Non-iterable value Bike().tires is used in an iterating context (not-an-iterable)
Just to be I want to mention that I'm not looking to suppress the error with pylint: disable=not-an-iterable
