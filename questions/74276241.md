# Could not run "bash build/build.sh" command in Windows PowerShell

Currently I'm working on testing a github repository and I'm following the github's README.md that requires me to run "bash build/build.sh" command line to build environment. But I somehow could not make the command run in my PowerShell. Windows PowerShell keeps showing "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Use 'wsl.exe --list --online' to list available distributions
and 'wsl.exe --install ' to install.
Distributions can also be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
Error code: Bash/Service/CreateInstance/GetDefaultDistro/WSL_E_DEFAULT_DISTRO_NOT_FOUND"
I have installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux Preview from Microsoft Store but I still could not run the "bash build/build.sh" command.
