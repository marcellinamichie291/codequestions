# Data Studio - sort by change metric

Probably something simple I am overlooking, but when creating a table and setting a time period, the previous time period value is calculated and displayed as either a % change or absolute value change.
I'm wanting to create like a "top winners and losers" table, where report viewers can quickly see values that increased and decreased the most, by simply clicking the delta column. Visitors can currently see and sort which had the most or least sessions, but sorting the change would be incredibly helpful

How can I do this?
I looked for sorting options to change in the Sort setup section, and also looked in the sort options from the 3 dots when hovering over the table
