# Changes to .env file not detected when running application locally

I have an ASP.NET Core 3.1 application and I changed the database in the SQL Server connection string in my .env file. I then restarted Visual Studio, cleaned and rebuilt the solution. When I run my application locally, it still uses the old connection string database.

How do I get my ASP.NET Core 3.1 application to read the updated connection string values?
