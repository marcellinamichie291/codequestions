Here is my code to create a dictionary with no duplicates. I am getting error AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'. Thank you for your help.
       mydict = {"c" : "2", 
                "b" : "3", 
                "a" : "4", 
                "d" : "1",
                "e" : "1",
                "f"  :"1"
              
                }

dup_free= {}
for key, val in mydict.items():
    if (key, val not in dup_free.items()):
        dup_free.append(key, val)
