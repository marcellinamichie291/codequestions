I'm trying to extract the boundary facets of a periodic c3t3, i.e. all boundary facets including those at the periodic boundaries. My current approach is to try to iterate trough all the tetrahedra and test one by one its facets with "is_infinite" (see the code snipped bellow), but  "is_infinite" is always returning false.
for(Cell_iterator cit = c3t3P.cells_begin(); cit !=c3t3P.cells_end(); ++cit) {
    for(int l=0; l<4; ++l) {
        const int id = V[cit->vertex(l)];
        CGAL_assertion(1 <= id && id <= medit_number_of_vertices);

        t[l] = id - 1;
        if( tr.is_infinite(cit, l) )
            std::cout << "is true!" << std::endl ;//Facet_boundary.push_back(points[t[l]]);
    }
}
