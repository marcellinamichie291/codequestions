# Android serial port API - I'm stuck totally

I am working with tablet which has internal RS232 ports and try to implement api to my app for data exchange via serial ports.
The Internet everywhere said about android_serialport_api.
My app has minSDK26, tagetSDK29.
What I am doing is:

Extract serialport folder from zip
In Android Studio click Import module and choose folder. Now I got serialPort in project tree
Then I add to app gradle implementation project(path:'serialPort')
Now I can use SerialPort class in my app
After intall on device and start opening serial port i got this:



The solution from the internet is to add in gradle

defaultConfig {
    ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "x86"
    }

Now I got another error:

And for now I am stuck at all.
Please give my any advice how to fix it.
