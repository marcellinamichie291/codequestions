# Automatically show selected value

There are two separate tables for users and roles. So for the roles would have a number between 1~7 and would have different roles depending on each users. We are trying to create a dropdown for when the selected role when registering would be updated to the users table. My problem is, we are currently showing the lists of role but we are not being able to show the current role updated to the current user. There are no forms involved. We are just fetching data from the database.
<?php
    $admin_id = $_SESSION['user_id'];
    $roles = mysqli_query($con, " SELECT * FROM roles ");
    $selected_role = mysqli_query($con, " SELECT * FROM users u LEFT JOIN roles r ON u.role=r.role_id WHERE id=$admin_id ");
?>
<?php
    while($total_roles = mysqli_fetch_array($roles)){

?>
        <option selected="" value="<?php echo $total_roles['role_id']?>" ><?php echo $total_roles['role'] ?></option>

<?php
    }
?>

I tried adding in,
<option selected="<?php $selected_role['role'] ?>" value="<?php echo $total_roles['role_id']?>" ><?php echo $total_roles['role'] ?></option>


It doesn't seem to work :(
