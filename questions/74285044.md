# Why Am I not able to run my program in Code::Blocks?

When I build and run the program, it shows that "It seems the project has not been built yet.Do you want to build it now?". If I click yes, it shows the same thing.If I click no, I shows a black dialogue box"Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 0.000 s
Press any key to continue." When I click a key, It just closes and does not run the program.
I checked if the compiler was there and it is. Though, it does not show any warnings or errors, It does not run the program.Whats the solution for this issue?
