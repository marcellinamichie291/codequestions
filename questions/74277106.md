# Does Thinfinity Virtual UI work with embedded browsers (Cefsharp)?

My company wants to try out the library "Thinfinity Virtual UI", to run a Windows Forms application in a browser.
It seems to more or less work, though the application crashes everytime an embedded browser is attached to the form (Cefsharp), see attached image.
I am not able to catch the error in the try/catch.
Any ideas how to remedy/debug this issue?
I tried searching the web for a solution/alternative to CefSharp, looking at error logs, inserting the try/catch. I also wrote to the company, but so far I get no reply.
