# OpenCV VideoWriter rached "No source in GStreamer pipeline" problem

I'm processing some videos using OpenCV library, basicly reading video frames (As cv::Mat), process them, then output them using cv::VideoWriter. At first, I'm using OpenCV compiled with FFmpeg to write video files (mp4 files)
cv::VideoWriter writer;
bool bwriter = writer.open("G:\\Path_to_video\\video.mp4", cv::VideoWriter::fourcc('a', 'v', 'c', '1'), 25, cv::Size(480 * 2, 288 * 2));

It works fine but the output file is too large due to high bitrate. Which is 6921kbps but my source file is only 1006kbps. After checking This issue, I changed my OpenCV library complied with GStreamer and using this code:
cv::VideoWriter vwriter;
bool bwriter = vwriter.open("appsrc ! videoconvert ! avenc_mpeg4 bitrate=1000000 ! mp4mux ! filesink location=video.mp4", cv::CAP_GSTREAMER, 0, (double)25, cv::Size(480 * 2, 288 * 2), true);

But it doesn't work. Here's the output:
[ WARN:0@0.008] global F:\vcpkg\buildtrees\opencv4\src\4.6.0-9a95a1b699.clean\modules\videoio\src\cap_gstreamer.cpp (1813) cv::CvVideoWriter_GStreamer::close_ OpenCV | GStreamer warning: No source in GStreamer pipeline. Ignore

I want to know what causing this problem and how to solve it please.
