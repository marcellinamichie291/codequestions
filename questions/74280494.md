# How to fix FileNotFound error while running pytest

I am trying to write tests for my project but i get back the FileNotFound Error when running the test.
test is in the folder test. file and code it is testing is in project folder. i cant reference the file as project/file because then my code breaks. anyone any ideas how to fix this?
filename = ('postcode_File.xlsx') is how it is referenced now in the code
so i tried to reference it as project/file
i als tried to copy the file into the test folder
neither worked
