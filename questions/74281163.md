# How to distribute an array accoding to specific conditions in Google Apps Script?

I'm an absolute beginner so please bear with me if my explanations or understanding of things isn't the best. I'm trying to organize an array I have according to certain conditions that must be met.
I have 3 kinds of arrays:

array1: Of people
array2: Of dates
array3 (various): Of groups of people from array1

To each date corresponds n amount of arrays of groups (It can vary). What I need to do is take array1 and distribute people on proportionate numbers to each of the dates available on on array2. To do that, I need to check that people asigned to a date, are not repeated in any of the arrays of groups.
For example, let's say I have 20 people in array1.
var array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

And lets say I have 4 dates available.
var array2 = ["date1","date2","date3","date4"]

For date 1 for example, I have lets say 3 groups:
var group1 = [1,6,7,8]
var group2 = [4,5,9]
var group3 = [6,17,15,3,11]

So I need to split array1 proportionately with the number of dates available in array2 (in this case 20 people in 4 dates so 5 people per date), but making sure that the people in the resulting split arrays are not in any of the same groups I mentioned before.
For example I can´t have 6 and 7 in the same resulting array for date1, because 6 and 7 are in group1. But I could have 17 and 9 because even although they are in the arrays for date1, they're in group3 and group2 respectively (different groups, not a problem).
What I've done is I tried to use a for loop to check for each value in array1, but couldn't find the proper way to do it since I also need to check each of the groups (1,2, and 3) and also check for the people that have already been asigned to that specific date.
I also tried first splitting array1 between array2.length, and I was planning to compare the result with each of the groups using:
function missed(invited,attended){
  return invited.filter(function(e){return attended.indexOf(e) === -1});
}

But then I realized that I don't know how to replace a value of the split result If It doesn´t meet my criteria.
I hope I made myself clear. Please excuse me if any of this is too complicated but I'm having a hard time understanding how to do it myself. Thank all of you in advance for any help you can provide.
