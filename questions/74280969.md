# Add new line to a file (txt) after cin in c++

I am trying to insert some characters as input from the user and save that input to a text file. The input data is correctly added to the text file, but the problem is that I cannot add a new line.
for example:
my input is
a

s


d

f

g

When I open the file, the data is displayed as follows
asdfg

How can I fix this problem?
