# Pandas: efficient way to replace entire string with a substring

I have a dataframe that looks like this:
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['John','William', 'Nancy', 'Susan', 'Robert', 'Lucy', 'Blake', 'Sally', 'Bruce'],
    'injury': ['right hand broken', 'lacerated left foot', 'foot broken', 'right foot fractured', '', 'sprained finger', 'chest pain', 'swelling in arm', 'laceration to arms, hands, and foot']
    })


    name      injury
0   John      right hand broken
1   William   lacerated left foot
2   Nancy     foot broken
3   Susan     right foot fractured
4   Robert  
5   Lucy      sprained finger
6   Blake     chest pain
7   Sally     swelling in arm
8   Bruce     lacerations to arm, hands, and foot      <-- this is a weird case, since there are multiple body parts

Notably, some of the values in the injury column are blank.
I want to replace the values in the injury column with only the affected body part.  In my case, that would be hand, foot, finger, and chest, arm.  There are dozens more... this is a small example.
The desired dataframe would look like this:
    name      injury
0   John      hand
1   William   foot
2   Nancy     foot
3   Susan     foot
4   Robert  
5   Lucy      finger
6   Blake     chest
7   Sally     arm
8   Bruce     arm, hand, foot

I could do something like this:
df.loc[df['injury'].str.contains('hand'), 'injury'] = 'hand'
df.loc[df['injury'].str.contains('foot'), 'injury'] = 'foot'
df.loc[df['injury'].str.contains('finger'), 'injury'] = 'finger'
df.loc[df['injury'].str.contains('chest'), 'injury'] = 'chest'
df.loc[df['injury'].str.contains('arm'), 'injury'] = 'arm'

But, this might not be the most elegant way.
Is there a more elegant way to do this?  (e.g. using a dictionary)
(any advice on that last case with multiple body parts would be appreciated)
Thank you!
