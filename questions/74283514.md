# Python: How to compare time in 24 Hrs format

I am stuck with this tricky part with time manipulation:-
start_time = 22.00.00  -------------[10pm]
end_time = 05.00.00 ---------[5.0am]
current_time = 01.00.00 -----------[1am]
Here, I want to verify my current time is between start and end time.
This line of condition does not work here:-
if start_time < current_time < end_time:    
     DO THIS

How am I suppose to handle this ?
