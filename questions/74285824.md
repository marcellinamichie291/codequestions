# Error message Stock analysis not working for (stock)


Hey I have been coding a trading bot in Phython and this pops up for all stocks (Stock analysis not working for (stock)) has anyone seen this before? I am using the modules NewsApi.org and yfinance but I dont know wich of these creates this message. Its not like an error the message just prints itself for every  Stock.
I cant Find a Solution
