# How to turn off only X-axis and Y-axis on 3D plot

I am trying to code a physics engine and have created a falling cube. I am plotting it with matplotlib and I would like to only show the "floor", which is at Z=0, when the cube begins bouncing upwards.
I have only found solutions that turn off all axes but no solution where the Z-axis is the only one shown. I have also tried to add a Z=0 plane subplot, but that seems to both make the plotting much slower as well as the perspective making it look like the cube is falling through the floor.
I tried ax.set_xticks([]) and ax.axis('off') but this hasn't helped.
This is what it looks like now:

I would in a perfect world only have the 'floor' (as well as have it expand over the entire floor, but that's another problem).
