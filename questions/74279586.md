I tried a system where the email is checked on the text file its registered on with the register function:
def register(email, password):
    file = open("user_details.txt" , "a")
    file.write("\n"+email+","+password)
    file.close()

Then this should be the read function where the code checks if the email is on the text file
    else:
        print("Enter your email and password to register")
        email = input("Enter your email: ")
        file = open("user_details.txt", "r")
        already_registered = False
        for i in file:
            a = i.split(",")
            if a == email:
                already_registered = True
                break
    if already_registered == False:
#email sending proccess






    if already_registered == True:
        begin()

I dont understand the problem with this code? Like what do I have to add?
