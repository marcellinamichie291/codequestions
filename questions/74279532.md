# limit the number of repetitive consecutive characters in a string

I'm preprocessing tweets, I need to set the limit of the consecutive occurrences of "@USER" to maximum 3 times. For example a tweet like this :
"this tweet contains hate speech @USER@USER@USER@USER@USER about a target group @USER@USER"
after processing, it should be like :
"this tweet contains hate speech @USER@USER@USER about a target group @USER@USER".
This worked with a while loop, I'm wondering if someone knows how to do it with a simpler way. Thanks!
tweets = ["this tweet contains hate speech @USER@USER@USER@USER@USER about a target group @USER@USER"]

K = "@USER"
limit = 3
i = 0
for tweet in tweets: 
    tweet = tweet.split(' ')

    while i < len(tweet):
        if tweet[i].count(K) > limit:
            tweet[i] = K*int(limit)
            tweet = " ".join(str(item) for item in tweet)
        i +=1

print(tweet)



this tweet contains hate speech @USER@USER@USER about a target group @USER@USER
