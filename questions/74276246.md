# Using the grep function in R despite different upper and lower cases

I'm currently trying to check whether the text elements:
brands <- c("Nike", "Adidas, "D&G")
are to be found in the vector:
text <- c("I love Nike", "I love Adidas")
For this I use the code:
brands_subset <- unique (grep(paste(text,collapse="|"),
brands, value=TRUE))
However, this only works if the upper and lower case of the brands and text elements match. Is there any way to find a match between the brands and text elements even if I had text elements like:
text <- c("I love nike", "I love Adidas").
