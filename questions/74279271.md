# Adding columns to a Spark dataframe conditionally

I have a Spark dataframe like the one below:

Also, another dataframe:

The output that I expect is below. I need two columns to be added conditionally to the original data dataframe where:
"offeramount1" = 75% of (amount)
"offeramount2" = 65% of (amount)
This offer is only to be given when the code is not in the "exclusioncode"

I am able to add the columns without any issues using withColumn, but I'm unable to compare the data frames properly.
