# Nginx allows for url that start with /# even though I allow access only to 1 path

I'm trying to restrict access to all url paths except for one. Here's how my nginx.conf (split into 2 files) looks:
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    upstream promo {
        server localhost:82;
    }
        
    server {
        listen 82;
        location / {
            add_header Content-Type text/plain;
            return 200 "gangam style";
        }
    }
    # nginx is running on Windows machine
    include .\conf\promo.conf;
}

events {}

The file .\conf\promo.conf contains additional configs where I have my server running on port 81 and restrict access to any request with request path other than /gateway*. So both /gatewayABC gateway/abc /gateway would be considered valid:
server {
    listen 81;
                    
    if ($request_uri !~ ^/$|^/gateway) {
        return 403;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://promo;
    }
}

So here's the catch:

Whenever I send get request to http://localhost:81/gateway or http://localhost:81/gateway/abc I do get 200 status (AS EXPECTED)

When I send get request to http://localhost:81/hello I get 403 (AS EXPECTED)

However, when I alter a little bit my last request to http://localhost:81/#/hello I do get 200 for some reason (NOT AS EXPECTED)


So what is the problem with my config unable to recognize # as invalid pattern?
