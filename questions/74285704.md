# Client Connect sequence not working in Paho MQTT

I have a pseudo-sensor from which I have to get data and use the Paho MQTT library to prepare to send MQTT messages to AWS.
I implemented the following code for sending the data:

import paho.mqtt.client as paho
import os
import socket
import ssl
from time import sleep
from random import uniform
from psuedoSensor import PseudoSensor

connflag = False

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    global connflag
    connflag = True
    print("Connection returned result: " + str(rc) )

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print("Connected with status: {0}".format(response_code))


mqttc = paho.Client()
mqttc.on_connect = on_connect
mqttc.on_message = on_message


awshost = "XXXXXXXXXXX.iot.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com"
awsport = 8883
clientId = "Project_1"
thingName = "Project_1"
caPath = "C:/Project 1/aws-iot-rootCA.crt"
certPath = "C:Project 1/cert.pem.crt"
keyPath = "C:Project 1/privkey.pem"

mqttc.tls_set(caPath, certPath, keyPath, cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED, tls_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2, ciphers=None)

mqttc.connect(awshost, awsport, keepalive=60)

mqttc.loop_start()

while 1==1:
    sleep(0.5)
    if connflag == True:
        for i in range(30):
            ps = PseudoSensor()
            h,t = ps.generate_values()
            mqttc.publish("temperature", t, qos=1)
            print("msg sent: temperature " + "%.2f" % t )
            mqttc.publish("humidity", h, qos=1)
            print("msg sent: humidity " + "%.2f" % h )

    else:
        print("waiting for connection...")



I understand that mqttc.on_connect = on_connect isn't working, i.e., not setting the connflag as "True" because I am getting an output as "waiting for connection", but I don't know why.
Can anyone help me with this?
