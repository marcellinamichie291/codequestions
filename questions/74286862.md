# logrotate using lastaction with long running jobs

I'm using logrotate with lastaction in order to do stuff with the last rotated file.
The job is very long and I don't know if this is the reason but since I added this script the logs are no longer rotated and I have to kill the cron.daily process.
Is it a good idea to run it in the background ? And if yes, how to do that ? What are good practices with long running jobs ?
