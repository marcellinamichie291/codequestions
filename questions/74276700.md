# Can't mint with ethers.js using Polygon/Matic

I'm trying to mint using ethers.js API, but when ethers.estimateGas function provides unpredictable gas (which seems to be frequent).
I can't manage to manually set the gas limit:

When I set it as the output of provider.getGasPrice, I receive a "tx fee (X.X ether) exceeds the configured cap (1.00 ether). I tried changing the value of gasPrice for the network in the hardhat config file, as it was stated in this question, but that didn't work either, and I can't find where to configure the cap.
When I use a lower value (I slowly approached the 1.00 tx fee value to see what happened below that value), I get an "exceed block gas limit" error.

Any help will do! Thanks in advance.
