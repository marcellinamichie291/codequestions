# Can we use pypy for opencv projects in windows?

I tried installing pypy 3.7/ 3.8/ 3.9 and failed when tried to install numpy/matplotlib/scikit-learn/opencv libraries with pip on windows.
then tried to install it on anaconda and when I install pypy when I try to activate venv it shows these errors:


when I ignored it and tried to run my code with this installation it took 5x more time to run it, in cpython it took 4s and in pypy it took 24s
i'm using numpy and opencv in this test code but main code has all libraries that I tried to install did I do something wrong or need to change something?
tried pypy3.7/3.8/3.9 standalone and on anaconda3
test program on cpython took 4s and with pypy it took 24s
