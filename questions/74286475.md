# Errors with ns-3.31 python bindings

I am using the contributed module of tsn. The git repository is below.
https://github.com/DenKrysos/Time-Aware-Shaper-TAS-in-ns-3
And when I am trying to active the python binding for this, and use the "./waf --apiscan=tsn" command, it terminates with the error of the picture.
Can somebody please help me with this?
