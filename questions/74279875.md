# Merge join in PostgreSQL performs sort on indexed column

I am trying to optimize the following query in postgresql
    SELECT ci.country_id, ci.ci_id,ci.name
    FROM customer c
        INNER JOIN address a ON c.a_id = a.a_id
        INNER JOIN city ci ON ci.ci_id = a.ci_id

The columns customer.a_id, address.a_id, city.ci_id and adress.ci_id all have an btree index.
I wanted to use a merge join instead of a hash join as I read that a hash join not really uses indexes so I turned of the hash joins with Set enable_hashjoin=off.
My query is now according to the query plan using a merge join but it is performing always a quick sort before the merge join. I know that for merge join the columns need to be sorted but they should already be sorted through the index. Is there a way to force Postgres to use the index and not to perform the sort?
