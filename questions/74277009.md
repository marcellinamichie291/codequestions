# I need to validate data is in JSON format in python

I'm making a program that needs to validate that certain data is in json format. What's in the json does not mater and will change each time a user runs the program. Could anyone provide examples of ways to validate that data is in a json format?
Currently attempting to use the jsonschema library.
