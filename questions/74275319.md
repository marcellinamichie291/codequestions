# Remove sub directory from URL in PHP

I have this format in localhost 
http://localhost/Smiles/admin/pages/treatment/index.php
What I want is to remove the folder pages
http://localhost/Smiles/admin/treatment/index.php
It's also not limited to admin because I have staff, user, and dentist
http://localhost/Smiles/staff/treatment/index.php
And incase I upload this to cpanel I want to achieve this
https://example.com/admin/treatment
