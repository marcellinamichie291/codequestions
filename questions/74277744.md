# React Native - "The security strength of SHA-1 digest algorithm is not sufficient for this key size" - Build APK

I have this problem while building the apk of a React Native application:
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Failed to generate v1 signature
Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Failed to sign using signer "CERT"
Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Failed to sign using SHA1withDSA
Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: The security strength of SHA-1 digest algorithm is not sufficient for this key size

Knowing that the keystore was generated using Java 8. And now, I'm using Java 11 in another computer.
Is there a way to solde this problem without generating new keystore, because the app is already store ?
Rolling back to Java 8 not working because it's not compatible with thew new Version of React Native 0.70.
