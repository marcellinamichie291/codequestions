# webgl application reloading after network reach 100mb

i have a webgl application wich download multiple 3d files and render it to the scene on each click by user, all work fine here but later when we ran perfomance test we could notice few perfomance related issues.

the ios safari browser is getting crashed and reloading once the network reach 100mb of file download.

since the 3d files are on an avarage 10mb its not getting cached in the browser but still reaching the network traffic i dont have an option to reduce the files further.


is there any way stop safari from refreshing after it reach 100mb or why its happening ?
any help is highly appriacted.
