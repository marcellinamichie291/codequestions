# MySQL Rollup format

How do I format the "total" row of a rollup?
Backgroup
I have a MySQL select statement that is using group by with rollup it works however, for formatting reasons I need to identify what row is a "detail" and what row is a "total."  Doing this by a simple RowType column that is a 1 or a zero. I figured this would work:
select
   if (MyId is null, 1,0) as RowType,
   MyId,        
   sum(Quantity) as Quantity
from MyTable
group by MyId with rollup

This does not work.  However, If I create a view of that select statement then select that view and do this it does:
Create view MyView as 
select
    MyId,   
    Sum(Quantity) as Quantity     
from MyTable
group by MyId with rollup;

select
    if (MyId is null, 1,0) as RowType,
    MyId,
    Quantity
from MyView;


Is there a better way?  I am going to have to do this for a fair amount of queries and maintaining two sets is good way to have errors.
edit: screwed up my second select code and fixed it
