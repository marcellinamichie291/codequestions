# ios- keyboard hiding / overlapping the text fields in ionic

when user click on bottom text fields then text fields not shifted to the top so that keyboard overlap on the text field. so user can not see what he typed until he hide the keyboard. The issue I'm facing in IOS device using IOS 12 version. Please give me some perfect solution because I tried lots of solutions but nothing is worked.
Thanks in advance.
keyboard should be shift to the top when user click on text fields. but It's not shifting it's overlap the text fields.
