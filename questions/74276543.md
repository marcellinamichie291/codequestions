# Write DataFrame to Excel Template and Save as new file

I have a dataframe and an Excel template file, which has a worksheet that contains column headers, some formula, and pivot tables on another sheets.
I want to paste the data onto it then save the template as a new Excel file.
First thing I notice is that I cannot save the template as a new excel file.
Second is I cannot write the Dataframe to existing worksheet, it will create a new sheet for the data.
Then I found an option on pd.ExcelWriter, if_sheet_exists='overlay' on the internet. But it gives me Error
'overlay' is not valid for if_sheet_exists. Valid options are 'error', 'new' and 'replace'.
I'm using pandas version 1.5.1. Is it still possible to achieve this, or is there any better solution?
def write_report(df):

    template_filename = f'Daily Quality Report Template.xlsx'

    today_str = datetime.strftime(datetime.now(), '%Y%m%d')

    result_filename = f'Report\\Daily Quality Report {today_str}.xlsx'
    result_sheetname = today_str    
    
    # create new file
    xlresult = Workbook()
    xlresult.save(result_file_name)

    # write
    writer = pd.ExcelWriter(result_filename, engine='openpyxl', mode='a', if_sheet_exists='overlay')

    writer.book = load_workbook(template_filename)

    writer.sheets = {ws.title: ws for ws in writer.book.worksheets}

    df.to_excel(writer, result_sheetname, startrow=1, header=False, index=False)

    writer.save()
