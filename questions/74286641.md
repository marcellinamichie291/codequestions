# What is the mechanics behind this below update contract balance

In below function, how the contract balance is updated by just assigning the msg.value into deposit parameterized variable?
function transferToContract(uint256 deposit) public payable {  require(msg.value == deposit); deposit = msg.value; //how it works? }
I'm trying to find answer about behind the mechanics of the above code.And I'm expecting the precise and to the point answer of this.
