# TeamCity: Number of tests 0 is less then the provided threshold

I have a TeamCity build configuration
And one build step.
Runner type -- Command Line
Step name -- test
Run -- Custom Script
Script:
conda create -n my_env python=3.8 pytest
source activate my_env
pytest my_file.py

The script is working (I can see results in log PASSED [100%])
But in the "Status" I see
TeamCity: Number of tests 0 is less then the provided threshold

How can I say TeamCity to count my tests?
