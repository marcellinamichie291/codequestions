# Why does v1SigningEnabled not working for AGP 7.1.3

My project's minSdk is 26, AGP is 7.1.3, and when I enable v1 + v2 signature in gradle signing config like this:
v1SigningEnabled true
v2SigningEnabled true

The final apk contains v2 + v3 signature:
Verifies
Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): false
Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true
Verified using v3 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v3): true
Verified using v4 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v4): false

Is this an AGP bug?
I searched the google issue tracker and seems it was an old version's bug and was announced to be fixed in AGP 4.0.0, seems it come out again.
