# Trying to locate intersection points in pgfplot

I am trying to plot the following figure (see the imgur link) using Pgfplots. I can do it the hard way by placing the nodes manually, but I would like to do it in a smarter way. More specifically I would like the location of the nodes corresponding to the intersection points between the blue curve and the blue line to be automatically defined. Is it possible?
