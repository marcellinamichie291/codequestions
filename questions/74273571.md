what are best practices for using /usr/local/etc or /etc folder for user config files in user scripts/programs? Can this folder be accessed system wide similiar to the folders in $PATH?
Thank you!
I'm expecting to find systemwide config files in /usr/local/etc or /etc inside my app (located in /usr/local/bin), "installed" to the system by me.
