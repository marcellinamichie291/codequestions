# Separating overlaying colors in opencv

Let's say I have a picture with two colors, but both their colors are overlapping.
Object A is a star, and object B is a rectangle with a star-like hole. They overlap each other.

Is there a way of separating the objects? Kinda like finding the intersection and summing up to their "pure" standards?


I see two ways of doing this: via shape recognition or via color. Don't know which way would be smarter.
First I tried to separate the colors via histogram in grayscale, such as in BATspock's question
import cv2 
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

img = cv2.imread("origin.jpg")
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
hist = cv2.calcHist([gray],[0],None,[256],[0,256])
colors = np.where(hist>25000)

img_number = 0

for color in colors[0]:
    print(color)
    split_image = img.copy()
    split_image[np.where(gray != color)] = 0
    cv2.imwrite(str(img_number)+".jpg",split_image)
    img_number+=1

plt.hist(gray.ravel(),256,[0,256])
plt.savefig('plt')
plt.show()

But no success in getting the color of that intersection due to very low Histogram values.
I tried using the example present here, although it renders the same effect I desire, the example just refers to color splitting in RGB. Is there anything similar to this output but choosing the colors instead? Maybe feature recognition? Watershed? I'm lost.
