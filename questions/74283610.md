# Click on input image with vba webscraping

I am trying to do web scraping with vba. The problem is that I can't 'click' on the consult button, it gives an error, apparently I can access the input that contains the 'consult' image. What I am trying to do is recursive processes that select each element of the select and then click on consult to end up extracting the customs rates for each position of each chapter of the ncm, but to simplify the code it would be enough for me for now to be able to click for at least one element of the first page. Thank you very much
vba code:
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Scraping
End Sub


Sub Scraping()
    Dim IE As Object
    dim URL = "https://www.afip.gob.ar/aduana/arancelintegrado/default.asp"
    dim txtN1, txtN2
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False 
    
txtN1 = "SELECCIONE CAPITULO"
txtN2 = "SECCION"

 Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
 
    With IE
        .Visible = True
        .Navigate URL
        While .Busy Or .readyState < 4: DoEvents: Wend

        Dim a As Object, currentOption As Object

        Set a = .document.getElementsByName("consultar")
            
        For Each currentOption In .document.getElementsByTagName("Option")
            If (InStr(currentOption.innerText, txtN1) + InStr(currentOption.innerText, txtN2)) = 0 Then
                currentOption.Selected = True
                
                a.Click
                Exit For
                
             End If
        Next currentOption

        '.Quit
    End With
End Sub

I attach the code with my attempt.
