# WooCommerce email templates - Remove {site_title} from email body

Hello – recently my email template sent to customers once they place an order are including the site title outside the main email body.

this is a WooCommerce store.

I haven’t made any changes recently that I can recall, and tried deleting the copied email template from my server and just use the original but the issue persists.
Any Advise on how to remove it?
