# Why does a parallel thread started in Flask (Python) project execute everything two times?

I'm writing a Flask project and I need to implement an automatic compilation system for typescript files (for debug purposes of course) so I created a Thread that does this operation, constantly checking whether files have been edited or no, but it's not working properly since it does everything 2 times (prints 2 times, compiles 2 times).
#Thread class
class TSCCThread(Thread):
    def __init__(self, debug: bool):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.debug = debug

    def run(self):
        while True:
            for file in listdir(TS_PATH):
                if file.find(".") == 0:
                    continue
                elif file.split(".")[-1] != "ts":
                    remove(TS_PATH+file)
                    continue
                js = JS_PATH + file.replace("ts", "js")
                if not exists(js) or getctime(js) < getmtime(TS_PATH+file):
                    print(f" * Detected change in '{getcwd()}/{TS_PATH+file}', recompiling.")
                    run(["tsc", TS_PATH+file, "--outDir", JS_PATH])
            if not self.debug:
                break

#Start point in app.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if active_count() == 1:
        ts_check = TSCCThread(DEBUG_MODE)
        ts_check.start()
        if not DEBUG_MODE:
            ts_check.join()

I tried changing the class to extend Process (from multiprocessing) instead of Thread and also to use Popen (from subprocess) and put it in a separate tscc.py file but nothing could fix that. Also tried checking for active threads count before starting it but doesn't seem to fix the issue. The issue seems to be pretty "random" since I thought it was fixxed at some point but then started showing again. I also tried running everything after a reboot to make sure it wasn't something like threads left in background and doing stuff with the running one but the result was the same. Finally, added a sleep at the end of every for-loop execution but still executing two times everytime I edit a file.
