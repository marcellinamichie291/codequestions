# Item filtering but keeping track of filtered out items

Let's say I have a list of items like below and I would like to apply a list of filters onto it with ramda.
const data = [
  {id: 1, name: "Andreas"},
  {id: 2, name: "Antonio"},
  {id: 3, name: "Bernhard"},
  {id: 4, name: "Carlos"}
]

No biggie: pipe(filter(predA), filter(predB), ...)(data)
The tricky part is I would like to define my filters with a key for tracking what items have been filtered out by which filter.
const filterBy = (key, pred) => subs => {
  const [res, rej] = partition(pred, subs)
  return [{[key]: rej.map(prop('id'))}, res]
}

This all screams monad chaining or a transducer, but I can't get my head around it how to put it all together.
Let's say I have a 2 predicates:
const isEven = filterBy('id', i => i % 2 === 0)
const startsWithA = filterBy('name', startsWith('A'))

I would like to get a result that looks like this tuple with a rejection map and a list of "accepted" items (isEven threw out 1 and 3 and startsWithA rejected 3 and 4):
[
  {
    id: [1, 3],
    name: [3, 4]
  },
  [{id: 2, name: "Antonio"}]
]
