# ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR using a reserved IP address on Digital Ocean

So I have a digital ocean droplet running apache with an SSL certificate provided by LetsEncrpt. When I use the Inet address of the server everything works as expected. I have now added a reserved IP address to the droplet however when trying to access that via HTTPS is get the Generic ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR running through a tester it appears to indicate no SSL protocols are support.
The reversed IP address does indeed route to the server, I can SSH over it for example.
Im using UFW which is configure to allow any on 443.
Any insight/advice would be greatly received.
