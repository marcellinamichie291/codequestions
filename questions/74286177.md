# How to initialize Repository in Testing-Environment?

I want to test one of my Controllers, which originally accesses to my Service. My Service then initializes the Repository to store data.
In my ControllerTest.java I am annotating the Repository and Service I need with @Mockbean, but I am getting the Error that for example the Repository-Attribute isn't initialized and is null.
This is how the beginning looks like:
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
//In this test, we want to launch only StudentController. All other controllers and mappings will not be launched when this unit test is executed.
@WebMvcTest(value = TodoController.class)
@WithMockUser
public class TodoControllerTest {

    // To launch only TodoController
        @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

        @MockBean
    private TodoService todoService;

    @MockBean
    private ToDoRepository todoRepository;

    @Test
    public void retrieveDetailsForEintrag() throws Exception {
        Todo mockTodo = new Todo("Drink", "01.11.2022");
        todoRepository.save(mockTodo); //FIRST ERROR HERE

How can i initialize them in the Testingclass?
Thanks!
Even though this is a Unit Test and I didn't want to import dependencies or other classes, I was thinking to import the Repository.
