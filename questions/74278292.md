# Graphql dynamic variables

I have a graphql query and the variables that needs to be passed with the query like this :
    {      
{
 "input": [      
      {           
       "ConnectionString": "${connectionString}", 
       "data": {      
       "pointId":”${deviceIds}”,     
       "commandMetaData": "{\"AccessControl\":\"Readonly\"}"     
      }       
     },      
     {           
       "ConnectionString": "${connectionString}", 
       "data": {      
       "pointId":”${deviceIds}”,     
       "commandData": "{\"AccessControl\":\"Readonly\"}"     
      }       
     },      
   ]     }  

I need to create a  request where the input section of the graphql variables to be based on number of devices in the csv file. it can have 1 device or 2 or n devices.So it needs to have 'ConnectionString','data','pointId','commandData' as many times as the number of devices in csv file.
How can i do this in jmeter if it is possible?
