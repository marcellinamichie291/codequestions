# MongoDB crazy slow when there is an $or inside of a query using an $and, How to get it to hit the index

I have a MongoDB collection with geocoded information in it.   In some cases I want to allow promoted items to be included that are not within the geographic area defined.  Below is an example of the query.
Takes about ~8500ms
{
    "$and": [{
            "After.Start": {
                "$gte": ISODate("2022-10-28T00:00:00Z")
            }
        },{
            "$or": [{
                    "LongLat": {
                        "$geoWithin": {
                            "$centerSphere": [[-111.888221740722, 40.760311126708999], 0.012616093290458801]
                        }
                    }
                }, {
                    "ByPass": {
                        "$in": ["5162e"]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

If I run this as two separate queries I can't add additional criteria or sort or page it correctly but it runs MUCH faster.

    "$and": [{
            "After.Start": {
                "$gte": ISODate("2022-10-28T00:00:00Z")
            }
        },{
            "LongLat": {
                "$geoWithin": {
                    "$centerSphere": [[-111.888221740722, 40.760311126708999], 0.012616093290458801]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

{
    "$and": [{
            "After.Start": {
                "$gte": ISODate("2022-10-28T00:00:00Z")
            }
        },{
            "ByPass": {
                "$in": ["5162e"]
            }
        }
    ]
}

I have non compound Indexes on all three fields with the Index on LongLat being a 2dsphere.
I also have a compound index on LongLat and "After.Start".  Is there a different way that I can index this or perhaps store the data to add a ByPass.
