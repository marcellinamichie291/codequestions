# Train a model with one solution for multiple feature groups

When gathering real world data, many times it doesn't come as detailed as we want it. This is a simple example to illustrate the problem I'm facing.
We need to train a model to predict the weight of a person, given it's diet, workouts per week, age, height, and sex. To do so, we gather a group of volunteers to get some data, which we'll use to feed the model. We also hire a team, leaded by person_a, to make the proper interviews and measurements to the volunteers. Once the data is taken, person_a explains to us that they were running out of time, so they had to weight two volunteers at the same time. We're left with a table like this:




id
diet
workout per week
age
height
sex




1
carrots
2
35
1.55
female


2
chocolate
8
50
1.80
male


3
milk
0
25
1.7
male


4
cookies
3
60
1.72
female




And we also know that:

weight of id1 + id2 = 140 kg

weight of id3 + id4 = 145 kg


Is there something that we can do to work with this type of data?
