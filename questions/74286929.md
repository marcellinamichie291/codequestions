# How can I get details about a SimpleBlobDetector_Params file?

When I am trying to understand how to adjust parameters of SimpleBlobDetector and I saw that default parameters works just fine for me. I want to read the default values. As I saw in the tutorial, there is a read funtion that takes a FileNode as an input.
void cv::SimpleBlobDetector::Params::read(const FileNode &fn)

Instead of C++, I am not very experienced in python and having rather hard time to figure out how to call constructors etc. If it would be cpp, I presume I would construct a FileNode and feed to the read function. But this method doesn't work with python. I tried different ways but couldn't manage to make it work. I was expecting to be something like this..?
pp = cv2.SimpleBlobDetector_Params()
fn = cv2.FileNode()
pp.read(fn)

I also saw that FileStorage should be involved somehow..?
fs = cv2.FileStorage('test.xml', cv2.FILE_STORAGE_READ)
fn = cv2.FileNode(fs)
pp.read(fn)

I couldn't find any usefull resources about this FileNode thing in Python. Examples about SimpleBLobDetector itself are also quite dry and similar to each other. So an example containing FileNode and SimpleBlobDetector is not very possible to find, which I find quite suprising. So any help will be appreciated.
