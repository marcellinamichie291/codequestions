# How to use AWS Lambda synchronously with AWS Glue

I have a lambda function that executes a crawler, SNS job and ETL. Is there any way to make the lambda function wait for the crawler to finish first before the SNS and ETL?
Thanks
I currently don't have the IAM access for step functions yet but still require this to be done. Currently it just all executes in one go therefore the SNS and ETL aren't working as intended.
