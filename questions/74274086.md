# Not able to create prod build on ionic with API Level 31 in ionic 3

I have changed targetSdk to 31 which giving error with cordova-android 10.1.1 Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for android:exported when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined
AndroidManifest.xml
When I'm adding android:exported=true/false in <service>, <activity> and <receiver>  its giving error duplicated with element declared with android:exported in <service> or <receiver>
