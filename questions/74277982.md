# Postman use Response of an Request for another Rwquest

So I have created an Collection with 2 Requests and many more can follow.
The first Request is an "Get Token" and I want to use the response access_token as my access token for my second Request.
The "Get Token" Request will be implemented in other Requests aswell.
Sadly I can't seem to find a ways implementing it.
This is my "Get Token" Request:
POST {{domain}}/oauth/token

Basic Auth

{
    "client_id": "administration",
    "grant_type": "password",
    "scopes": "write",
    "username": "{{user}}",
    "password": "{{password}}"
}

And my second Request is an simple "Get Products" using this:
GET {{domain}}/product
