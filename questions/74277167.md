# Why django filter is not working for not case sensitive search

I am trying to fetch the data from django models,
where as
TaskBlockers.objects.filter(task__project=1,task__team='Backend')

gives queryset with 3 objects
TaskBlockers.objects.filter(task__project=1,task__team='backend')

gives empty queryset.
it was supposed to return same for both the queries isn't it? if now why is this happening and how  can I rectify it for both type of input.
here are my models.
class TaskBlockers(models.Model):
    task = models.ForeignKey(ProjectTask,on_delete=models.SET_NULL,null=True,related_name='task_id_related')
    blocker = models.CharField(max_length=100,null=False)

class ProjectTask(models.Model):
    project = models.ForeignKey(Projects,on_delete=models.SET_NULL,null=True)
    team = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    task_title = models.CharField(max_length=200,null=False)
    task_desc = models.TextField(blank=True)
