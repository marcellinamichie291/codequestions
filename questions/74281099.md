# Should I be storing poke-api data locally?

I'm building a complete pokedex app using react-native/expo with all 900+ PokÃ©mon.
I've tried what seems like countless ways of fetching the data from the API, but it's really slow.
Not sure if it's my code or the sheer amount of data:
export const getAllPokemon = async (offset: number) => {

  const data = await fetch(
    `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=10&offset=${offset}`
  );
  const json = await data.json();

  const pokemonURLS: PokemonURLS[] = json.results;

  const monData: PokemonType[] = await Promise.all(
    pokemonURLS.map(async (p, index: number) => {
      const response = await fetch(p.url);
      const data: PokemonDetails = await response.json();
      const speciesResponse = await fetch(data.species.url);
      const speciesData: SpeciesInfo = await speciesResponse.json();

      return {
        name: data.name,
        id: data.id,
        image: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/${data.id}.png`,
        description: speciesData.flavor_text_entries,
        varieties: speciesData.varieties,
        color: speciesData.color.name,
        types: data.types,
        abilities: data.abilities,
      };
    })
  );


Then I'm using it with a useEffect that increases offset by 10 each time and concats the arrays, until offset > 900.
However like I said, it's really slow.
Should I be saving this data locally to speed things up a little?
And how would I go about it? Should I use local storage or save an actual file somewhere in my project folder with the data?
