# Angular input change event if we use iOS "From Messages" on an input after SMS arrives

I have 6 inputs for a code, which arrives via SMS.
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[1]" #char_one (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_one)">
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[2]" #char_two (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_two)">
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[3]" #char_three (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_three)">
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[4]" #char_four (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_four)">
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[5]" #char_five (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_five)">
<input type="tel" maxlength="1" max="1" name="chars[6]" #char_six (paste)="OnPaste($event)" (input)="SplitCodeIntoInputs(char_six)">

On an iOS phone after the SMS arrives you can click into an input and use their feature to copy the code "from messages" into the input, but it seems there is no event for this? I am completely lost, as I need to split the code into the 6 inputs.
What happens right now: The whole code is pasted into the input, (paste) and (input) are ignored.
The only idea I have right now is to create a loop, which observes the inputs and executes the code if length is > 1, but this feels more like a workarround, is there really no event for this?
