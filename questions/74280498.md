# Slice or substring on search query mongoose so it fits the given parameter it is returning empty

I am trying to use query search in mongoose when user hast array of objects with different postalCodes.
And I have an object which is called Job.
At job I have postalCode as String.
What I want to achieve it is for each postalCode from users to slice the postalCode on jobs and if possible to match them.
Problem it is that always it is returning empty but in case it should match with the job and return it.
User it is always the logged in user.
Here is my Code of 1 user.
"searchFilter" : {
    "remote" : 0,
    "data" : [
        {
            
            "country" : "DEU",
            "searchActive" : false,
            "postalCode" : "123456",
            "available" : {
                "$date" : 1664955924380
            }
        },
        {
            
            "country" : "DEU",
            "searchActive" : false,
            "postalCode" : "850",
            "available" : {
                "$date" : 1667165151744
            }
        }
    ]
},

And this is the job.
"postalCode" : "12345",
"country" : "DEU",
    
    

And this is my actual query search.
 let job = await Job.find({
  
                $or: user.searchFilter.data.map((user) => user.postalCode)
                .map((postalCode) => ( {
                      yearSubstring: { $substr: [ "$postalCode", 0, postalCode.length ] },                
              }))

            
});

if (!job) {
   res.status(204).json({ error: "No Data" });
   return;
 }
return res.status(200).send(job);
