# How to allow ESLint work with multiple <script> tags in Vue3?

Imagine this simplified code snippet:
<template>
    <div>Your number is {{number}}</div>
</template>

// since script setup tag doesn't allow for exports this is allowed. 
// I use it to create a pinja store that can be exported.
<script lang="ts">
    export const x = 10;
</script>

<script setup lang="ts">
    const props = defineProps({
        nr: Number
    })

    const number = props.nr * x;
</script>

This is a valid syntax, except ESLint seems to automatically move the exported value into the  ` tag:
<script lang="ts"> 
    // This stays empty
</script>

<script setup lang="ts">
    export const x = 10; //this gives an error
    const props = defineProps({
        nr: Number
    })

    const number = props.nr * x;
</script>

which gives an error as in Vue3 you cannot export from <script setup>.
How can I disable eslint for automatically moving this code around, and how can I disable for export errors in vuefiles?!
