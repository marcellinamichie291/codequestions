# Slots Availability for a project

I am working on a project that deals with bookings.
I currently hit a wall on how to get my booking system done. Basically, my idea is to allow a shop to register their services with us and a customer can book that service. For example, a barber shop might have different haircuts and services and each of them has a duration. for example, he might list, three services.
Service 1 duration: 30 mins
service 2 duration: 15 mins
service 3 duration: 60 mins/1hr
Now, the problem with this I need a way to create an availability slot for each shop, and each shop they have its own opening hours and closing hours. Available slots need to be shown at the time when the customer selects the date on which he/she wants to book their appointment. So customer selects a 02-10-2022 date API will be called that shows the available slots on this date.
So that when the customer wants to book a service, first he has to check availability by showing him the calendar.
How should I go about implementing this?
I know this is a very complicated process so if someone can give me the starting point or an idea that would be perfect.
Thanks
