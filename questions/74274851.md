# Rogue 'PowerShell' entry in Win 11 Start Menu, doesn't exist in filesystem. How to remove?

During an update I believe the latest version of PowerShell was installed separately and after the system update, but before a required reboot. This is Windows 11 and updates and rollbacks are fast and loose and all up in your business, so that is my assumption on how this happened in the first place.
I took a screen cap to show precisely what I mean, but note the missing icon on the menu entry. If you open the .lnk or File Location right a right-click you are taken to the normally appropriate Start Menu folder under Local User, where the other non-global links are. It isn't there. It also isn't under Public or Default users and I cannot locate it in the registry.
How can I remove this pimple on the ass of Windows 11? It's not critical but it really chaps my ass.

Have tried:
Manual deletion through appropriate right-click context menus.
Registry grep for file location under each main hive.
Uninstalled pwsh entirely, reinstalled.
Asking my mom.
