# Why PUT is no side effect?

The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), whereas successive identical POST requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.                  (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT)
I understand the no side effect is there is no impact on server resources. so why PUT is no side effect?
I googled but didn't get an answer
