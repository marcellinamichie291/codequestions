# How to alias c# class member with 'using static'

I like C# 6's using static feature:
using static System.Math;

// ...

var result = Abs(-100);     // instead of Math.Abs(-100);

But that clutters IntelliSense with everything else in the Math type. Most of the time I just need a few members from that type.
Is it possible to alias a specific member, rather than the whole class? Something like:
using static Abs = System.Math.Abs;
