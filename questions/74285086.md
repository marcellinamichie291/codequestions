# Why is OnTriggerEnter not working in Unity3D?

I am very new to unity, and this is probably going to seem like a dumb question to all the people who are good at C#, but I don't know why OnTriggerEnter is not working in this program. I have typed it as it said in the tutorial I'm following but it has no effect in the game. Help?
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class DetectCollisions : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            Destroy(other.gameObject);
        }
    }
}


I haven't tried anything yet, I don't know what to try.
