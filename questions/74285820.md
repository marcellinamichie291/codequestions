# How to run python's time.sleep() function in browser?

I am trying to write a python code compiler. I am able to run most of the python code snippets using brython. But I am not able to run the time.sleep() function. When I do, I get the below error traceback though time module is successfully imported.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "VFS.browser.timer.py", line 8, in f
    return func(*args)
  File "http://127.0.0.1:5500/brython-editor/index.html#python_script", line 32, in exec_code
    exec(_code)
  File "", line 3, in 
  File "VFS.time.py", line 237, in sleep
    raise NotImplementedError("Blocking functions like time.sleep() are not "
NotImplementedError: Blocking functions like time.sleep() are not supported in the browser. Use functions in module browser.timer instead.

Error asks me to use javscript implemented browser.timer function in python, which is basically similar to javascript's setTimeout.
Is there any way I can run exactly below code
import time
print("pause")
time.sleep(5)
print("resume")

And it gets executed with no errors?
pause
### Waits 5 secs ...
resume

Note: I want to execute this in browser itself.
