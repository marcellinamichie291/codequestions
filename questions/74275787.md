# How to remove Extra line at the end of my output

 void SongNode::PrintSongInfo()
 {
 cout<<"Title: "<<songTitle<<endl;
 cout<<"Length: "<<songLength<<endl;
 cout<<"Artist: "<<songArtist<<endl<<endl;

 }

//The problem I think is in the above code because I need to output the new line after Artist but not on the last set.
Output is nearly correct, but whitespace differs. See highlights below.
