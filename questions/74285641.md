# Are MongoDB Change Streams tolerant to an unreachable Listener

Let's say a particular micro-service listens to document deleted events from a particular database using the following code:
const collection = db.collection('inventory');
const changeStream = collection.watch();
changeStream.on('change', next => {
  // process next document
});

and for some reason the service went down for a while and documents were deleted while the service was down.
When next the service comes up will MongoDB still be able to send the events of the deleted documents while the service was down?
