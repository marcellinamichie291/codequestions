# Why does a seemingly useless query condition affect mysql execution so much

version: mysql 5.7.28-log
The sql statement is as follows：
EXPLAIN 
  select * from t_bill b
    inner join t_user u on b.uid = u.uid 
    where b.id > 0
    and b.repayment_date = '2022-10-25'
    and b.status = 0    
    and u.country_id = 1
    and b.b_type = '10001'
   **and b.c_status = 1
    and b.create_time < 1667318400000**
  order by b.id 
  LIMIT 1000;

The data volume of the t_bill table is 100 million
The data volume of the t_user table is 30 million
t_bill table index：
repayment_date normal index
uid normal index
t_user table index：
uid unique index
This sql takes about a few seconds
The above sql execution plan：

Note the bold part of the above sql, my data all meet these two conditions, that is to say, all data c_status is equal to 1, all data create_time is less than 1667318400000
The problem is, when I comment out any one of the conditions c_status=1 or create_time < 1667318400000, the execution plan immediately becomes very poor, and the sql execution takes a long time
Execution plan after removing c_status=1 or create_time < 1667318400000

Why? These two conditions are always equal. In fact, I can't think of adding these two conditions at all. Why is there such a big difference when adding this seemingly useless condition?
I don't understand why removing a seemingly useless condition, why the difference is so big, I wouldn't even think of adding those two conditions in reality
