# How can I ensure that a certain string (or data) is not in my file? PYTHON

I'm trying to ask for students' IDs and save it to a file, and if a student inputs an ID number that already exists in the file, it will print an invalid message.
I tried doing this by reading the file first and used if-else statement to check if the student ID is in the file or not. If it is, it will print the message; if not, it will add the student ID to the file. But for some reason, even when I input the same ID, it never shows the message and adds it to the file even though it already exists in the file. Where did I go wrong?
Here is my code:
file = open('testfile.txt', 'r')
if student_id in file:
    print("There is already a student with the same ID")
else:
    names_file = open('testfile.txt', 'a')
    names_file.write(str(student_id) + ',' + name + ',' + str(mobile) + ',' + '0.0\n') 
    names_file.close()
