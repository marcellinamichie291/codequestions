# My for loop keyword "item" is greyed out, out of no where

I have been trying to make a for loop assign values to 8 variables in a list but the for loop "item" keyword is greyed out, and I am 99.999% sure that I did it right please help.
G1l1x = 0
    G2l1x = 0
    G3l1x = 0
    G4l1x = 0
    G5l1x = 0
    G6l1x = 0
    G7l1x = 0
    G8l1x = 0
    Cx = [G1l1x,G2l1x,G3l1x,G4l1x,G5l1x,G6l1x,G7l1x,G8l1x]
       for item in Cx :
           item = 1000


thanks!
