# Prevent the user from clicking before an animation is completed

$(myEl).on('click', function() {
     // animations and other stuff
});

How can I prevent the user from clicking on myEl before the handler has completed animations?
let click = false;

$(myEl).on('click', function() {
    if (click) return false;
    click = true;

    // animations and other stuff

    click = false;
});

The method I proposed assumes the creation of a new bool variable for every other 'click' element such as myEl. Is there a way I can do this without relying on that assumption?
