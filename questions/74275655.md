# AWS Lake Formation: How to view which principals are associated with an LF Tag

I can see both from the console and the command line, which resources (e.g. Database, Tables etc) that an LF Tag is associated with.
However I cannot see which principals have been granted permissions on these resources via an LF Tag.
I am expecting to be able to view the principals with which an LF Tag has been used to Grant Permissions on Lake Formation Resources.
