I am working on small Java Spring Boot application for airlines but I have trouble access airlineList from another class, see screenshot.


I searched something on the internet but unsuccessfully, tried creating method for that list but it doesnÂ´t help, so I suppose someone had similar problem before, thanks for any suggestions!
