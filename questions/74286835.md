# Prettier format stopped working in VSCode (prettier/prettier error)

Good morning, how to fix my Prettier extension doesn't format correctly my React codes. It was working perfectly onSave and at alt+shift. Now not anymore.
I followed and checked theses steps but still can't manage to make VSCode format my code like before.
