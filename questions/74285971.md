# Trigger deployment of Docker container on demand

I have a web application that helps my client launch an API with a button "Launch my API".
Under the hood, I have a Docker image that is ran on two Google Cloud Run services (one for debug environment and one for production).
My challenge is the following: How can I trigger the deployment of new Docker containers on-demand ?
Naively, I would like that this button call an API that trigger the launch of these services based on my Docker image (that is already in Google Cloud or available to download at a certain URL).
Ultimately, I'll need to use Kubernetes to manage all of my container's clients. Maybe I should look into that for triggering new container deployments ?
I tried to glue together (I'm very new to the cloud) a Google Cloud function that trigger a new service on Google Cloud Run based on my docker image but with no success.
