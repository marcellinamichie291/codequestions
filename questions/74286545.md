commands like p4 cstat or p4 changes work only for files how can I get latest synced cl for a directory. when I use these command s for directories I get this.
commands I tried
p4 cstat "path"
p4 changes -m1 "path#have"
p4 changes -m1 "path"#have
p4 changes -m1 "path"
I did add '...' with the path
result cl of the first file in the directory
I expect last synced cl of directory
