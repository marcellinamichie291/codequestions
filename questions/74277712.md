# Does `UserManager<TUser, TKey>` exist in .NET core?

I used to develop ASP.NET sites using ASP NET Identity. Using it, I had this UserManager: UserManager<TUser, TKey>. That way, I could use TKey as int because my database tables used int identity fields. So, I could do things like this: _userManager.FindByIdAsync(1);. That instruction returned the user whose identity was 1.
With .NET Core, I could create my own ApplicationUser this way:
public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser<int>
{
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }
    public string? LastName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? FirstLoggedOn { get; set; }
    public DateTime? LastLoggedOn { get; set; }
}

So I am telling the system that the key field is an integer.
How can I do the same for UserManager so that I don't need to convert the identity to string in calls such this one: _userManager.FindByIdAsync?
The only UserManager I could find in .NET Core was: UserManager<TUser> : IDisposable where TUser : class
