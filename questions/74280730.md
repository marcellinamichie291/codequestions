# 2 dataframes with 2 column , replace information of the second column in the first with info from the second column if match exactly the first column

I have two CSV with two column.
First CSV with 24K item
ProductId Value
XXX       5
XYZ       3
ZXX       7
KWQ       5.37
i have a second csv on the same way but with less product and not in order and some not include in the first one.
Second CSV 13K Item
ProductId Value
YYY       3
XXX       9
XYZ       0.01
I want to replace all value of the first list if Productid match between the list with the value column of the second one
i try with panda (something im not familiar at all) since im pretty noob in python...
i could get a match with .isin but my brain couldn't figure out the way to take the value of the second column of the 2.csv to replace the second value of the match in the 1.csv...
