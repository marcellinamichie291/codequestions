# Can URL API endpoint self-correct?

I am using fetch API inside a React application to retrieve and display some quiz questions.
This is my url endpoint: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=${amount}&difficulty=${difficulty}&type=multiple
I have noticed that:
-when I misspell part of the URL before "?" then the response doesn't get back.
example:https://opentdb.com/api.ph?amount=${amount}&difficulty=${difficulty}& (missing "p" of php)
-when I misspell part of the url after "?" then, sometimes I get an empty array back, sometimes I get the data back. How can I get data back with a wrong URL?
example: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amoun=${amount}&difficulty=${difficulty}&type=multiple (missing "t" in amount)
I haven't deployed the application yet, I am using vsc and run npm start to develop the application.
Is it possible that the URL auto-corrects? or maybe it gets cached?
my code:
    export const fetchQuizQuestions = async (
  amount: number,
  difficulty: Difficulty
) => {
  const endPoint = `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=${amount}&difficulty=${difficulty}&type=multiple`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(endPoint);
    console.log(response);

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    if (data.results.length === 0) {
      throw new Error("The part after ? contains some mistake");
    }
    //below I create the new property "all_answers" and make sure the answers order is never the same
    return data.results.map((question: Question) => ({
      ...question,
      all_answers: shuffleArray([
        ...question.incorrect_answers,
        question.correct_answer,
      ]),
    }));
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.log(error.name);
    console.log(error.message);
  }
};
