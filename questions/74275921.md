# Line Segments Intersect with shared starting and ending points

I'm trying to test if lines can be placed by seeing if they would intersect with any existing lines in a list.
public static bool onLine(Line l1, Vector2 p)
    {   //check whether p is on the line or not
        if (p.x <= Mathf.Max(l1.startingPoint.x, l1.endingPoint.x) && p.x <= Mathf.Min(l1.startingPoint.x, l1.endingPoint.x) &&
           (p.y <= Mathf.Max(l1.startingPoint.y, l1.endingPoint.y) && p.y <= Mathf.Min(l1.startingPoint.y, l1.endingPoint.y)))
            return true;

        return false;
    }

    public static int directionV2(Vector2 a, Vector2 b, Vector2 c)
    {
        float val = (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - b.x) - (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - b.y);
        if (val == 0)
            return 0;     //colinear
        else if (val < 0)
            return 2;    //anti-clockwise direction
        return 1;    //clockwise direction
    }

    public static bool isIntersect(Line l1, Line l2)
    {
        //four direction for two lines and points of other line
        int dir1 = directionV2(l1.startingPoint, l1.endingPoint, l2.startingPoint);
        int dir2 = directionV2(l1.startingPoint, l1.endingPoint, l2.endingPoint);
        int dir3 = directionV2(l2.startingPoint, l2.endingPoint, l1.startingPoint);
        int dir4 = directionV2(l2.startingPoint, l2.endingPoint, l1.endingPoint);

        if (dir1 != dir2 && dir3 != dir4)
            return true; //they are intersecting

        if (dir1 == 0 && onLine(l1, l2.startingPoint)) //when p2 of line2 are on the line1
            return true;

        if (dir2 == 0 && onLine(l1, l2.endingPoint)) //when p1 of line2 are on the line1
            return true;

        if (dir3 == 0 && onLine(l2, l1.startingPoint)) //when p2 of line1 are on the line2
            return true;

        if (dir4 == 0 && onLine(l2, l1.endingPoint)) //when p1 of line1 are on the line2
            return true;

        return false;
    }

This is what I've managed to gather so far through other posts but I'm struggling adjusting it to include that two lines can share the same starting position without it being intersecting.
Update: I figured that adding the conditions l1.startingPoint != p && l1.endingPoint != p would be the solution. The code however seems to still be producing intersecting lines. I'm uncertain if my solution is wrong or if I'm creating the issue in a different part of code.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
