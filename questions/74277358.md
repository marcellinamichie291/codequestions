Does anyone know of a simple way to extract the textures from a texture array? I have a .asset file which is the texture array but am unsure how to get the images off of it.
The only way ive thought of would be to use the GetPixelData or GetPixels methods to have it recreate the images, im wondering if anyone has done this before as im unsure where to start with this or if that would even work.
Does anyone know of a more simple way to do this rather then having to make a script to do it for me?
