# Postgresql: remove ability to query every row in a table

I have the following table called "profile":
id, name, created_at
Every user ( with SupaBase ) has his own row in the "profile" table with his user_id as the key ( id )
I added RLS so that only the user can update/delete his own row but everyone else can only select the row ( anyone can see his profile )
This works great but the issue is that someone could query every single user in the table using SELECT * FROM profile or something similar. I only want people to be able to view a row if they already have their "id" or their "name" with a WHERE statement.
The only solution I see is to remove the ability to SELECT the table ( basically make it private ) and make an API that will query with the admin key ( bypasses the RLS ). That way, no one could query the whole table and the client would just call the API which would then query the data.
However, I would like to query directly from the client so I want to know if there is a different solution that doesn't require an API in between. Currently learning Postgresql so I'm probably missing something really simple.
