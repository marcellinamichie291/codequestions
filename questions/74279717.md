# Changing font style in doxygen document

I am creating a programming project for my college and I wanted to change the font of the project name, the project brief and the project number.
I am using doxygen version: 1.8.17
I am a novice in these wanderings so I would kindly ask you if you could not omit any step on your explanation on how to change the font of those three texts I already mentioned.
I tried modifying the doxygen.css file only in the “projectname”, “projectnumber” and “projectbrief” areas where it says << font: … ; >>.
Later I realized that for the change to not be overwrote by a new doxygen.css (which doxygen generates automatically if the HTML_STYLESHEET tag is left blank) I had to add the path to that file. Did that and no more overwriting.
Still no appearing changes in the index.html file.
