# kibana dashboards, control and index variation in arrays

I have elastic documents that are created by an ingestion pipeline, notably containing a JSON processor. this JSON processor produces some fields which are arrays, like my_kpi1: [1,2,3] , my_kpi2[4,5,6] , and i'm fine with it ... Now my question is: Is it possible to create a control on a dashboard which would make the array indice vary and modulate the kql of my lenses ? For instance if selected index on control is 2, then some chart would use for instance sum(my_kpi1.2) ... is it possible to do that ?
I tried to flatten the JSON structure of ingested JSON, so instead of having arrays each json element becomes a field of the elastic document.. it works but it's not very practical, because it makes quite a lot of extra fields then.
