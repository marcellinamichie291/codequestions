# How do I remove whitespaces and punctuation from my existing python code?

I tried splitting a text file into strings in a list. In a second step I tried to remove any whitespaces and punctuation from the items within the list.
Somehow I don't get the desired output. Is anyone able to help a newbie like me?
# necessary module for command line arguments
import sys

# printing the command line arguments
print(sys.argv)

# getting the file name from the command line arguments
file_name = sys.argv[1]

# opening file to read it and returning the file file_name
in_file = open(file_name, 'r')

splitted = []

# for each line in this file do...
for line in in_file:
    # tokenizing each line 
    splitted = line.split()
    print(splitted)

# removing punctuation and whitespaces
new_file = splitted.lstrip('.,?!;:-"(){}[] ')

This is my code.
