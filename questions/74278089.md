Hi i wanna draw a pyramid that look like this
                                          /\ 
                                         /  \
                                        /    \
                                       /______\

in Microsoft visual studio c# language but it's not working
i used this code in Microsoft visual studio
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("   /\ ");
            Console.WriteLine("  /  \ ");
            Console.WriteLine(" /    \ ");
            Console.WriteLine("/______\ ");

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

but it's not working
please explain to me if possible why not working why your code is working in other words (what i need to know )
