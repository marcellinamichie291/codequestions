# How to get the number of times a key is pressed in python?

For Ex: If a user presses '1' for two times , and press 'q' to quit, I need to get '1' is pressed two times.
import keyboard

c1=0
c2=0
while True:
    if keyboard.is_pressed("1"):
        c1+=1
    elif keyboard.is_pressed("q"):
        break
print(c1)       


It will print 5688 if I press '1' two times
