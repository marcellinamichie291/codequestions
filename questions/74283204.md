hi im applying The excel function
=IF(COUNTIF($A$2:$A$10,B2)>0, "Match Found","Not Found") 
for finding matches of Emails ID's from list in another list
the data looks like this
Column A                Column B                   output          function applied

XXXX.SSSS@gmail.com   XXXX.SSSS@gmail.com      Match Found     =IF(COUNTIF($A$2:$A$10,B2)\>0

where A$2:$A$10 --> the list of the email ID's
B2 is the email Id that i want to search in the list of emails in column All
this method sometimes catches emails and label it as not found but i can found it, and Vice versa
Required :-
i want to apply this excel function
IF(COUNTIF($A$2:$A$10,B2)>0
using python
Failed Trials
1-tried to catch it with Regular expressions but seems that there is no specific patterns to follow
2-Tried using the normal method concert the first column into list and second column into list and
list_1=list(column_A)
list_2-list(column_B)
for i in range (0,len(list_1):
             if list_2[i] in list_2:
                    print(match_found)
             else:
                print(match_not_found)
