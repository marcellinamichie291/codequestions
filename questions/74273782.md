# Float lose precision in javascript

i have an amount of tokens i want to burn i a web3 project , this amount is 0.29806008728157019 i want to pass this amount to web3.utils.toBN(Math.trunc(amount * 1000000000000000000)); as it is without changing it . the problem that i can't pass it as String and when i parse it using ParsFloat it becomes 0.2980600872815702 and this is a problem because i want exactly the same float. I tried to use toFixed(17) and toPrecision(17) but they change the float to string and the same problem occurs.
So how i can pass it as a float without changing it ?
