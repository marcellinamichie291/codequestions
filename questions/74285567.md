# No such file or directory in Google Cloud Bucket Problem

I am trying to implement my socket server and my model in Google Cloud, however when I try to run the python script. It gives me an error of "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'trained_model.p'".
The trained model is in the bucket and I changed the code of the python script to match it with the Google Cloud.
Here's the portion of the python script:
def Main():
    model = pickle.load(open('gs://liwanag_model/trained_model.p','rb'))
    ...

How can I successfully access the trained_model file inside the bucket?
