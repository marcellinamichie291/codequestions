# overlap event in react big calendar

I have some parallel events in a row in react-big-calendar. when the dayLayoutAlgorith param in calendar is no-overlap the view of calendar is like this:
(e.g. i have two events from 10:00 to 10:15 and in next row i have two events from 10:15 to 10:30 and the view ruined as you see)

and when i use overlap for ayLayoutAlgorith param, calendar is like this:

i want to have events that be next to each other without overlap and any empty space.
