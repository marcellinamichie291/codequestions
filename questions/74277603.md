# Step for adding PATH variables in a Gitlab pipeline

I am trying to create a stage in a Gitlab pipeline which will add PATH folders. Stuff from these folders should then be used in other stages.
For example:
stages:
  - prepare
  - build_npm

prepare_job:
  stage: prepare
  script:
    - '$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\nodejs"'

build_npm_job:
  variables:
    GIT_CLEAN_FLAGS: none
  stage: build_npm
  script:
    - cd "$env:SCRIPT_FOLDER"
    - npm install <----- THIS FAILS WITH "The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet..." 
    - npm run build
  dependencies:
    - prepare_job

However, when I do it like this, my build_npm stage cannot find npm. It seems that the PATH I set in the prepare stage isn't carried over into the build_npm stage.
Is something like this even possible?
I tried setting the PATH for the npm executable inside the build_npm stage. This seems to work.
