# How to repeat an Axios GET if the response is empty

I'm working with an endpoint that works most of the time but occasionally returns an empty string.  I want to repeat my request X number of times until I get a response that is valid or hits an attempt limit.
I'm pretty new to TypeScript - I'm still thinking in Java.  I've gotten this to work but am curious if there is a better way.
async getRandomVin(): Promise<AxiosResponse<IRandomVinResponse>> {
    let attemptCounter = 0;
    let response;

    do{
        response = await axios.get<IRandomVinResponse>(
            `${this.baseUrl}/${this.basePath}`,
            {
                headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
                validateStatus: (status: number) => status >=  200 && status < 400
            }
        );
        attemptCounter++;
    } while (response.data === '' || attemptCounter < 30);

    return response;
}
