# React | How to change the style of an element using useRef?

I want to change an element position base on the mouse position.
I have a list of images displayed in a line using flex and I want to move the container (track) to the right when the mouse is moved to the left.
For this, I want to change the track style but I find it difficult.
I tried using
navTrack.current.transform = `translateY(${-x})`;

but it throws an error.
This is the function:
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  const x = e.clientX;
  console.log(x);
  navTrack.current.transform = `translateY(${-x})`;
};

The function is called on onMouseMove.
