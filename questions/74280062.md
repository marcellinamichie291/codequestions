# Pionion Docker is not working on background

I am working on pionion for streaming.(https://pionion.github.io/docs/deploy/docker) I follwed their documentation and it worked fine for me. The command I used to run is "docker-compose up".
As I can't run this docker containers everytime so I run this docker containers on background using "docker-compose up -d" command. But it doesn't worked for me.
How can I run it on background and make it work as previous?
I want to up this streaming server for all time on background. So that I can use this without logging on the server.
