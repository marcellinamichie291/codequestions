# Newb Question - Why does cs50's "Volume" lab use a single variable "buffer" in fread() instead of using malloc or an array?

I am a beginner and I'm currently on cs50's lab #4 - "Volume". I believe I understand the solution other than the use of the buffer variable here-
    // TODO: Read samples from input file and write updated data to output file
    int16_t buffer;
    while (fread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input))
    {
        buffer *= factor;
        fwrite(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, output);
    }

From what I think I understand from the lecture, I thought that initializing a variable this way would assign a memory location on the stack, which is a static address and is not able to be indexed into like an array or a pointer on the heap.
Why is fwrite able to keep writing to the address of the same variable which is declared outside of the scope of the while loop?
The way the solution is written looks like the loop is just updating and multiplying the value of the same memory address over and over until the EOF. I could understand if it was int16_t buffer[]; instead because you can index into an array, but how does this solution work without using malloc? How is this not causing a segmentation fault?
I have watched through the lecture and shorts a few different times now to try to make sense of this but I am not getting it. I would really appreciate any help
