# git replace --graft loses files when merging unrelated histories

I have two distinct branches b1 and b2, no common ancestor. One adds f1, the other one adds f2.
When I run git replace --graft <> <> on them, I can see them sequenced properly using git log --graph '--pretty=tformat: %H %d %s %n' --all.
However, if I checkout the resulting branch, at the end of b2, I see a commit that adds f2, as it should, but also removes f1, which was added by the parent. Which kinda defeats the purpose since the whole point of this was to have that file along the whole history in all commits (hooks need that).
I tried all variations I could find of rebase, merge, filter-branch, filter-repo. The branch "hierarchy" looks right, but that change removing the file is really getting in the way.
