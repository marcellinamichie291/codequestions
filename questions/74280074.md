# Create TS interface with a dynamic number of dynamic keys

I need to create an interface that has a dynamic number of keys, with dynamic key values.
eg:
the object could look like
{
  email: string
  password: string
}

or
{
  age: string
  occupation: string
  height: string
}

and so on...
These object keys will be generated dynamically from a list of objects fields where fields: Field[] and
interface Field {
  name: string
  label: string
  type: string
  styles?: FieldStyles
}

basically using the name key/value from the list of Field's to set the keys on this new interface. (In this example case, the values of these dynamically set keys will always be of type string because they represent form inputs of type text, email, & password. All of which correspond to string types in JS)
I am trying to create an object like this
const defaultFormState: any = {}
  props.fields.forEach((field) => {
    defaultFormState[field.name] = ''
  })

but right now I have to use the any on defaultFormState to satisfy TypeScript and obviously, I want to avoid this.
How do I accomplish this?
