# How to extract bearer token from curl json response and pass it as authorization header a different api call?

I am making a call to OAuth API using curl command by passing username,password and getting the bearer token response as JSON  which is in the below format.
curl -X POST https://api.mysite.com/oauth/token -u "login:password" 

Response
{
   "token_type:"Bearer",
   "access_token:" "cfdadfa3234sfsdfxx......",
   "issued_at":15234234234,
   "expires_in":953343434,
   "scope": "asdfasd234234234asfasdfasdfaflalsdfkasjfa;sdfassdflj"
}

I need to get only the access_token value which is the bearer token from this curl JSON response and I need to pass as Authorization header  to a different  apigee gateway hosted api call.
curl -X GET https://apigee.mysite.com/getorderstatus -H "Authroization Bearer ???need to pass bearer token here ???"

How do I parse the JSON and get the bearer token as variable and pass it to the next API call?
I need to do this on the windows server. My environment is only limited to Windows. I can't install packages like jq due to security reason.
