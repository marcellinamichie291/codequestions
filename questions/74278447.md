# Notification popups in Excel when a certain value is reached

Reference image I currently have an excel sheet that tracks the number of books read by someone and I want to have a popup notification when they have read more than 10 books. I've attached a picture of what I currently have but it is not working. I have multiple sheets in this excel file, and so I think the problem might be I am not properly referencing the correct sheet and only the cell. Any help is appreciated thanks!
