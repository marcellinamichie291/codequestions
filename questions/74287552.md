# Count number of row from subquerry which have data with groupby clause

Below is my subquery:
Q1:
select count(a.ProcessDate),
        b.Market
from [dbo].[FileProcessLog] a
     LEFT JOIN [dbo].[FileMaster] b ON a.FileID = b.FileID
where Convert(date, a.ProcessDate) = Convert(date, getdate()-2)
GROUP BY b.Market

Now I want number of rows of the result table but when I use below query I got error:
select count(*)
from (select count(a.ProcessDate),
             b.Market
      from [dbo].[FileProcessLog] a
      LEFT JOIN  [dbo].[FileMaster] b ON a.FileID = b.FileID
      where Convert(date, a.ProcessDate) = Convert(date, getdate()-2) 
      GROUP BY b.Market)

I have tried with alisa name as well but it didn't worked at all. Please help in finding the solution.
