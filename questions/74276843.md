# Configure iOS App for Apple Sign in with MongoDB Realm Sync

I am trying to implement Sign in with Apple for my IOS app using realm sync. I am using the sign in to authenticate the user into realm. The thing I do not understand is that I am following these steps from the mongodb setup Apple ID signin:

In Step 2 on creating a services ID for the app in dev portal of apple. We must activate the Sign in with Apple service within the service identifier:

In order to do this we have to provide domains and return URLs? This is all done to create a JWT to put into realm for when activating the apple signing method on realm's side. I am confused by this - isn’t this only for web apps? Do I have to setup a web service on a cloud for this part? I see numerous tutorials on implementing Apple Sign In with Firebase and that's not required.
I genuinely don’t understand what I am supposed to do here. After reading Apple's docs, it shows that you have to do these steps if you are signing in through Apple on a different platform (we are signing in from iOS).
I tried finding tutorials or video examples of people implementing this on their realm database with iOS and I could not find any. I also tried to skip the step of creating a service ID and use the app ID in the script to create the JWT but it ends up being invalid.
