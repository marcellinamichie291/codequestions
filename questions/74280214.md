Below are the important details:
Dockerfile for nginx build
FROM nginx:latest
EXPOSE 443
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Nginx.conf
events {}
http {
  client_max_body_size 1000M;
  server {
    server_name _;
    location / {
      proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
      proxy_set_header        Host $host;
    }

    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate cert/name.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key cert/name.key;
  }
}

Nginx docker command
docker run -dit -p 0.0.0.0:443:443 -v /etc/cert/:/etc/nginx/cert <MY NGINX CONTAINER> nginx -g 'daemon off;'

Docker command to start gunicorn server
docker run -dit -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 <My FASTAPI CONTAINER> gunicorn -w 3 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 127.0.0.1:8000 server:app

Other details:

I expose port 8000 in my Fastapi container docker build
I run nginx docker command right before the gunicorn docker command
I am currently testing with python requests library and have turned verify=False for the SSL configuration
