# Socket IO Rooms: Get All the list of rooms

I am trying to get list of rooms, to show them in all clients so they can join any room the client want.
Server:



socket.on("ShowAllRooms",function(){

        var counter = true;
        for(var g=1;g<=500&&counter;g++)
        {
            
            var allRooms = io.sockets.adapter.rooms[g+""];
            if(allRooms== undefined)
            {
                counter=false;
            }
            else
            {               
                socket.join(g+"");
                socket.emit("ShowRoomData",{rooms: parseInt(g+"")});
            }

            
        }

    });


Client:

  private void OnShowAllRooms(string jStr)
    {
        
        var jsonData = JSON.Parse(jStr);
        TestObject data = new TestObject();
        data.room = jsonData["room"].ToString();        
        
        roomNumbers = data.room;

}




This is my code , i am making a poker game , currently i am able to create random room with limited clients and after complete each limit new room is created but unable to get all rooms list ,
the reason i am doing this is to show these rooms and lobby list so any client can join any room.
