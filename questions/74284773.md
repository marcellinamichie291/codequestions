# Returning UI field attributes in server JSON response

Let's say I have multiple form fields to be rendered on the UI. Also, as a standard Modify flow, assume that the fields rendered would have some attributes like value, mandatory, editable, disabled, label, regex (to validate against), etc
While "value" would have to be returned from the service (since it is persisted db value), is it a good practice to also return the other attributes/flags like mandatory, editable, etc from the service which might have some business logic (e.g. the field editable state being true or false is based on some specific workflow status value)
Is it better to avoid anything related to business logic to maintain on the UI V/s the argument that since mandatory, editable, etc are UI specific, they should be maintained on the UI.
Any reference would be helpful.
