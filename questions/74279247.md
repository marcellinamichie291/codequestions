I need a regex that has

One Upper Case letter
One Lower case letter
One Number
One Special Character
Minimum of 8 Characters long
No 3 sequential (or) repeating alphabets/numbers


My Regex works for 1-5 :
(?=^.{8,}$)(?=.*\d)(?=.*\W)(?![.\n])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z]).*$

Need to accommodate 6.
