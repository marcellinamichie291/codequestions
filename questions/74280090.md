I expect from you to give me a list of all the libraries that can help me and to explain what forms can i find in every library.
example:
from turtle import *
bgcolor('black')
speed(1000000)
hideturtle()
for i in range(320):
    color('pink')
    circle(i*0.8)
    color('orange')
    circle(i*0.4)
    right(3)
    forward(3)
done()
