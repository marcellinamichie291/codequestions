# How can i use django_channels and django_hosts libraries together?

I have added the django_channels library for realtime logic on my site. I have included the following websockets URL patterns (file my_project/asgi.py):
application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
    'http': get_asgi_application(),
    'websocket': AllowedHostsOriginValidator(
        AuthMiddlewareStack(
            URLRouter(
                news.routing.websocket_urlpatterns
            )
        )
    ),
})

Everything worked fine until I decided to configure wildcard subdomains using the library django_hosts(file my_project/hosts.py):
host_patterns = patterns('',
    host(settings.DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN, settings.ROOT_URLCONF, name='www'),
    host(r'(?P<p_category>\w+)', 'my_site.hostsconf.urls', name='category'),
)

And after that I can't connect to the websocket using javascript:

Is there a way to configure these two libraries so I can connect? I can't find the way to configure django_hosts to connect using the ws:// scheme.
