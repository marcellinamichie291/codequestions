I am include an App.php (rounting) page but my front.php do not get the type RouteCollection object (Argument #1 ($routes) must be of type Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection)
I am doing the excercise on the page:
https://symfony.com/doc/6.2/create_framework/routing.html
My front.php must get from the App.php (routing and routingcollection) the object of type RouteCollection
Argument #1 ($routes) must be of type Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection
