how to merge two dictonaries in python with union of values if the keys do exist in both. Each dictionary has values as list.
I have three dictionaries:
   d1 = {"KEY1": [1, 2, 3]}
   d2 = {"KEY1": [2, 3, 4]}
   d3 = {"KEY2": [1, 2, 3]}

how could I merge then so if:
   merge(d1,d2) --> {"KEY1": [1, 2, 3, 4]}
   merge(d1,d3) --> {"KEY1": [1, 2, 3],"KEY2": [1, 2, 3]}
