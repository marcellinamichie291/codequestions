# How can I change the max value in a Pandas Series based on a where condition?

I've built a random sampling tool that selects a proportionate number of samples from each team.
unique_counts = df.groupby(team)['id'].agg('nunique')

My tool then calculates a proportion for each team using the following code:
number_selected = pd.Series.round((unique_counts / unique_counts.sum() * 16)).astype(int)

This results in the following proportions:
proportions = pd.Series({'a':1.438433,'b':5.903743,'c':5.013904,'d':1.112299,'e':2070588,'f':0.462032})

|Team|          |
| a  | 1.438433 |
| b  | 5.903743 |
| c  | 5.013904 |
| d  | 1.112299 |
| e  | 2.070588 |
| f  | 0.462032 |

Resulting in:
> number_selected = pd.Series({'a':1,'b':2,'c':8,'d':6,'e':5})

|   a   |     1    |
|   b   |     6    |
|   c   |     5    |
|   d   |     1    |
|   e   |     2    |
|   f   |     0    |

However, I ran into the issue that the corresponding value could be less than one, so I put a check in the function to correct this as I need every team to have at least one selection
number_selected = number_selected.where(number_selected > 1, 1) #Keeps values > 1, changes <1 to 1

Now the problem that I am running into is that I do not want the sum of number_selected to be < 16 or > 16. Is there a way that I can check if the number_selected.sum() is not equal to 16 and modify accordingly?
Ideally I would like the number_selected's proportions to round the next nearest value up or down until number_selected.sum() == 16. I'm not sure if something like that is really possible. If it is not than, I could settle with the following:
If number_selected.sum() > 16, I would like to subtract 1 from the max value until number_selected.sum() == 16
If number_selected.sum() < 16, I would like to add 1 to the min value until number_selected.sum() == 16
