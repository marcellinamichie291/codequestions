# Stripe Subscription URL With Custom Pricing

I want to create a custom stripe subscription with dynamic pricing that can change depending on the user. But I'm struggling find any decent information about from the docs.
I mean I can generate stripe url with premade subscription product like the following,
  const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
    line_items: [{price: "XXXX", quantity: 1}],
    metadata: {
        author_id: message.author.id,
    },
    
  });

But to create subscription link with custom pricing,
Do I have to create whole new subscription product through api and then generate a link?
Or is there a better way to generate links with dynamic pricing?
