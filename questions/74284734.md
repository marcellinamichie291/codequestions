# Labview corrupt the .xlsx file when crash

I meet a problem in my workplace, with one of the older codes (written in 2015 Labview). The problematic part of the program was writing test data into an xlsx file and usually, once or twice a week labview crashed and corrupted the xlxs file. That means a serious data loss and I would like to fix it. We use LabVIEW Viewpoint Xlsx Toolkit to edit the excel files. I made a few screenshots where I think the problem happening.


Things what i tried:
-Breakpoint the code and kill Labview from the task manager when a file was open.
-Write data continuously into the xlsx file and kill the program at random moments.
-Write that much data that cause memory issue and break the code
None of my tries ended up with a corrupted xlsx file, the document always was openable and contained the older data!
Any tips are welcome because I'm pretty much out of ideas!
Thanks in advance, Peter
