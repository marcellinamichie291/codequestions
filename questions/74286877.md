# Electron: node-fetch sometimes doesn't call/return data

Recently I have been messing with node-fetch to get important data for my application, however it seems to only call/return data on certain occasions.
Rundown: Electron app, this code is in my pre-loader. I'm not sure if this is a CORS issue, or something else. Whenever setting up an error handler, I receive no response.
Here's a quick preview of what I have currently.
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

...

async function injectClans() { // Randomly works, othertimes it doesn't and I don't receive a response. Errors don't print either.

  let clans = {};

  await fetch('https://masond3v.github.io/serpent/clans.json').then(async res => await res.json()).catch(err => {log.info(err)}).then(async json => {

    clans = await json;
    log.info(json); // sometimes doesn't return anything, other times returns undefined. finally it can return a response.

  }).catch(err => {log.info(err)});
}

...

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  log.info('Do these call?'); // In fact, it does call this.
  injectClans();
}

Edit 1: Added something to make sure the event listener worked in the first place. The function just seems to act up.
