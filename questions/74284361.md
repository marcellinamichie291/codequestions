# Reasonable way to weight variable for ranking with R

I have the following 3 variables, x, y, z.
Each of them has value ranging from 1 to 50.
They are rank score.
What I want to do is to create a new rank where the weight of x, y are the same and z less than those two.
I can simply do this arbitrarily:
new_rank <- x * 0.5 + y * 0.5 + z

or
new_rank <- x * 0.1 + y * 0.1 + z

I'm not sure if this is a right approach. Is there a canonical way to go about it?
