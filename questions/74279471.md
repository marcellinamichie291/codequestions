# R Studio: Mutating a column variable based on two selection conditions


The dataframe above represents a repeated-measures design, each participant took part in both task A and B. The condition determines which order the tasks occurred - if in condition 1, then Task A came first followed by task B, and vice-versa for condition 2.
I would like to mutate a new column in my dataframe called 'First Task'. This column must represent the scores from the task that always occurred first. For example, participant 1001 was in condition 1, so their score from task A should go into this first task column. For participant 1002, in condition 2, their score from task B should go into the first task column, and so on.
After scouring possible threads (which have always solved every need I have!) I considered using the mutate function, combined with cases_when (group == 1), and thereafter I am not sure how to properly pipe something along the lines of select score from TASK A. Alternatively, I considered how I may go about using if or ifelse, probably the likely piece of code to execute something like this?
It would be an elegant piece of coding like this I am after, as opposed to re-creating a new dataframe . I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or ideas on this. Let me know if this is clear (note I have simplified this image as a example to make the question clearer).
Many Thanks community
