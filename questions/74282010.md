# Overlapping Pixels with matplotlib?

I want to take an image array, but overlap every point in the array by a certain amount.
In other words, I want to make an image arranged so that the pixels are size axa, but the pixel centers are spaced some distance <a.
Is there a simple existing tool to do this?
I have searched through documentation for matplotlib, but haven't found any function like this.
