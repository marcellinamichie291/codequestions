# Problem with overriding compareTo method in subclass

I am creating subclass and have some class elements inside it. Now I want to override compareTo method from super class and use variables from subclass as argument in new compareTo method but I get error saying that the argument for compareTo method must be the same as in the superclass.
Is there any solution to this problem?
Thanks in advance!
Solutions that I tried are:
1)just simply to write new method in subclass (not to override method from super class)
2) create new compareTo method in superclass with arguments I want
this way program is working but I feel like that is not the correct way to fix this problem
Anyone can suggest something or give advice about this?
