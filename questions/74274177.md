# Powershell 7 - Get-AzureADUser, AssignedLicenses, Convert Class to Object

When I retieve an AzureADUser while using the AzureAD module (imported with -UseWindowsPowershell), and trying to retrieve the property for AssignedLicenses, they return as a Class instead of an obect (e.g. just a string?)
class AssignedLicense {
  DisabledPlans: System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String]
  SkuId: zzzzzzzz-2c81-4ef7-yyyy-5b5392b571df}


class AssignedLicense {
  DisabledPlans: System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String]
  SkuId: zzzzzzz-fae0-4ca2-xxxx-7a907fd6c235
}

How would I convert such a thing to something I can actually use (e.g. an object?)
At first I thought it was JSON, but the ConvertFrom-JSON cmdlet gave errors on the notation, as far as I am aware there is no ConvertFrom-Class included in normal powershell :)
Did also try to just remove all the text and keep anything after SkuID, but that proves a challenge when the DisabledPlans is bigger/smaller than I expect.
