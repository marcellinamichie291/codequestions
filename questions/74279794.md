# Test Data Filter Name is inactive for "Add Comparison" in the reports to apply Data Filter for internal traffic in Google-Analytics-4 (GA4)

I have set up the Data Filter in GA4 property and have selected "Testing" Filter State. When I go to the realtime report to compare the all-traffic with excluded filter traffic, I see the "Test data filter name" inactive for me to select the internal traffic filter. I don't know why this filter is deactivated for me to select the filter name and compare the filtered traffic with all traffic. I tried looking up other resources but couldn't find anything even remotely close to discussing the problem and potential troubleshoot alternatives.
