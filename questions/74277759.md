I am looking for a way to force WooCommerce to calculate tax with 2 decimals only.
For now it calculates with more than 2 decimals and this produces confusing sub-totals and totals upon checkout.
Example
If I order one sweatshirt:

1x Sweatshirt £12.92 ex-VAT
Apply VAT 20%
12.92*1.2 = 15.504
So the product rounds up below to £15.50

However if I order two sweatshirts:

2x Sweatshirts £25.84 ex-VAT
Apply VAT 20%
25.84*1.2 = 31.008
So the product rounds up above to £31.017

My Problem
The problem I have is that for a £12.92 ex-VAT product, the client sees the price as being £15.50 which is correct. But of course with the way WooCommerce calculates it rounds up the total of £15.50*2 to £31.01.
My Findings So Far
I understand that the problem here is that WooCommerce calculates with more than 2 decimals and that the display prices show 2 decimals only. However I would like to force a way to calculate tax with 2 decimals only.
I also understand that entering prices inclusive of VAT and changing that setting would fix the issue. However I have many many products with many variations, some that are VAT-free and some that aren't so it would take considerable time to fix all the prices to be inclusive of VAT. Hence why I am looking for an answer here, any help is appreciated, thank you!
