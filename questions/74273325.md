# Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>

I am trying to run the following code:
#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include <Python.h>

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Py_Initialize();

    std::wcout << std::endl;
    std::wstring pyPath = Py_GetPath();
    std::wcout << L"Paths: " << pyPath << std::endl;

    std::wcout << std::endl;

    std::wstring pyPref = Py_GetExecPrefix();
    std::wcout << L"Exec Prefix: " << pyPref << std::endl;

    PyRun_SimpleString( "print('Hello World from Embedded Python!!!')" );

    Py_Finalize();

    return 0;

}

And get the following output in my console:
Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>

Paths: C:\Program Files\Python311;C:\Program Files\Python311\python311_d.zip;C:\Program Files\Python311\Lib;C:\Program Files\Python311\DLLs

Exec Prefix: C:\Program Files\Python311
Hello World from Embedded Python!!!

The question is what should I do to eliminate the "Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>" error? By eliminate I mean to make python to load its libraries correctly.
This is my CMakeLists.txt file:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

set(PROJ_NAME "Test")

project(${PROJ_NAME})

include_directories( $ENV{PYTHONPATH}/include )
link_directories( $ENV{PYTHONPATH}/libs )

list(APPEND SRC_LIST src/main.cpp)

add_executable(${PROJ_NAME} ${SRC_LIST})

And these are the values of the system variables:
PYTHONPATH - C:\Programm Files\Python311
PYTHONHOME - C:\Programm Files\Python311
The C:\Programm Files\Python311 path is also present in the PATH system variable
C:\Programm Files\Python311 is the folder where the python 3.11 is installed
When I run python from CMD, it does not show any errors:
>python --version
Python 3.11.0

>python
Python 3.11.0 (main, Oct 24 2022, 18:26:48) [MSC v.1933 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
