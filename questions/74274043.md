# Is it possible to schedule Autovacuum for PostgreSql RDS instances for a particular time?

I have an application running on PostgreSQL which have high frequence of data migration (from backend) and record creation (and updation) due to which the resource are getting occupied in Autovaccuming.
I know I can increase the threshold or factor parameter value to reduce it's triggering time but I just want the AutoVaccum to trigger at midnight allocated time, so that it don't hinder the application performance.
Is there any way by which it can be achieved?
I checked all the available parameters in the cluster-parameter-group but none of them seems to be solving the problem, also couldn't find anything on the web as well.
