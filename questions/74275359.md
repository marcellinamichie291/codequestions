# Laravel - How to cancel redirecting to login when unauthorized

In my project, I using laravel as api

UserController > profile() need token to run

For example when I call it without token, laravel display error which "Route [login] not defined" and it's right because we don't have any template in laravel.
How can I return json response instead redirect to login page as html?
public function profile(): JsonResponse
{
    //using protected method
    return response()->json($this->guard()->user());
}
