I’m looking at openjson solution 
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.DoSomethingWithEmployees
  @List varchar(max)
AS
BEGIN
  SET NOCOUNT ON;

  SELECT value FROM OPENJSON(CONCAT('["',
    REPLACE(STRING_ESCAPE(@List, 'JSON'), 
    ',', '","'), '"]')) AS j;
END
GO
EXEC dbo.DoSomethingWithEmployees @List = '1,2,3';

I just can’t warp my head around string_escape. What happened after this
STRING_ESCAPE('1,2,3', 'JSON')

looking at the document just don’t help
