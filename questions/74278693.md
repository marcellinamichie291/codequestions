# TypeError: Cannot read property 'SurfaceView' of undefined, js engine: hermes

After using the upgraded version of react native this error comes when I install & use some packages not all e.g: agora-rn-uikit. Hermes also enabled. I don't know from where this error comes; in my code there is no SurfaceView.

    A frequent cause of the error is that the application entry file path is incorrect. This can also happen when the JS bundle is corrupt or there is an early initialization error when loading React Native., js engine: hermes
