# Maven Probleme with compile: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile

i set up maven today and tried to compile an easy java programm. However i get this Error message and i have no clue what it means or how i can fix it.

pom.xml file

(i am also confused, because the command mvn -version is not showing java_home =  even though i set the system variable)
Thanks in advance for your help :)
My guess is that something is not quite rigth with the path of the JAVA_HOME variable because before that Error there was the problem that the path was showing to an jdr and not an jdk. But i changed the path (see picture 2) to and jdk so that should't be the problem anymore i hope.
