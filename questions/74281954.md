# Use of Deleted Function 'std::basic_ifstream

I am trying to make a program that opens a file and hunts for some values in the file. I'm doing this by making a function that is given a reference keyword and the file as inputs, and calling it within the main function and I'm finding errors saying that some functions have been deleted.
My Code
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;

string findLine( ifstream openFile, string reference){
    string line;
    getline(openFile,line);
    while(line.find(reference) == std::string::npos){

            getline(openFile,line);

        }
    return line;    

}

int main()
{
ifstream file;
    string name;
    cin >> name;
    file.open(name); //opens file
    if(!file.is_open()){"error while opening the file";
    
    }else{
        string ref;
        ref = "TOGW";
        string TOGW;
        TOGW = findLine(file, ref);
    }
}

The errors:
[{

    "owner": "cpptools",
    "severity": 8,

    "source": "gcc",
    "startLineNumber": 29,
    "startColumn": 24,
    "endLineNumber": 29,
    "endColumn": 24

and

I was able to get the same code working in a main function but I am trying to call a helper function for readability purposes.
