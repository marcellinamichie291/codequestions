# Writing a query to pull only newly added data from Postgresql database on a daily basis in python

I am pulling data from a Postgresql database on a daily basis. I want to change the query that only pulls the newly added data. The database has two columns of "id" and "date" and I want to pull only the ids and dates that are added today for a daily base. If no new date added (compared to yesterday) then it should stop the code and exit, otherwise, just pull the id and dates that are added today. Thanks.
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

connection = psycopg2.connect(user = "user1",
                             password = "123",
                             host = "admin",
                             port = "5423",
                             database = "dataset")

cursor = connection.cursor()
query = "SELECT id, date FROM table1 WHERE date >= date_sub(now(), interval 24 hours)"

cursor.execute(query)

data_tuples = cursor.fetchall()
cursor.close()
connection.close()

df = pd.Dataframe(data_tuples)
df.columns = ['id', 'date']

if df.shape == 0:
    exit()
    
    else:
        return False
