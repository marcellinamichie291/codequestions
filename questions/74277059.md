# How can I rcreate and read an Enviroment Variable so I can acces it from gradle

I have a very particular case where I want to save an api key into an enviroment variable and been able to read it from a gradle file to run a script (this file has .kts so i´m using kotlin).
In my file, i´m able to read the current enviroment variables using
// new_tag_version.gradle.kts
System.getenv()

After reading lots of answers and posts, i think the best way to do this is to create a variable in the sdk, but i don´t know how.
Could you please help me ?
Thanks.
