# Get Wordpress comments content WITH all html tags

Is there a Wordpress function that I can use to get the comment content including all HTML tags (for example the classic <p></p> wraps by wordpress)?
Something like the_excerpt() (no html tags) and the_content() (including html tags) for posts do?
With the following ways I only get back the "pure" comment content, no structure.
<div class="content">'. $comment->comment_content . '</div>
<div class="content">'. get_comment_text($comment_id) . '</div>
