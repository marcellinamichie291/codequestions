# Connecting Windows App (WPF) to SQL Database

I'm sure this is a very basic question to many but i'm struggling to establish what is considered best practice in terms of connecting an simple windows desktop app designed and built using WPF in MVVM, to a SQL database without asking the user to input a connection sql password, and without hardcoding a password in the application?
Whilst the application is used by many, I dont want to be creating multiple accounts within Management Studio to allow access so i'm guessing some sort of single 'system' account is considered the best way?
What i'm struggling to get my head round, is the system account password? How does the application know which account is used to connect to the database if I can't hardcode the password within the app, and not wanting to ask the user to input a password when 'logging in'?
Can someone just explain a little more about this system account (or point me in the right direction)? Is it an account I create in SSMS, under Security > Logins? Again, if I assign a password here, then my application needs to know about it? ...or should i be utilising some sort of AD group? Again, unsure how to link this altogether.
Any advice would be amazing, thank you in advance.
