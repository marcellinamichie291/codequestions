# XSSF worksheet cells having random styles

Is there any way to set style for all next cells in excel worksheet? Like for the rest of the document after certain cell?
I am using Apache POI 3.9 for exporting data to excel worksheet. Client wants colored font for invalid data. Everything is running fine, but sometimes, when I put text in empty cells in "INFORMATION" column, it makes font colored red, even after reseting cell style or explicitly asking for condition and then setting default cell style. Youre more likely to get my idea from pic of code. 
Ive uploaded some pic of excel too. Hope it helps. It starts on row 37, text somehow changes color even after not running through setting conditions. I havent recognized any pattern in there. 
I tried to change conditions, change cell style setting location in code... Had no effect.
