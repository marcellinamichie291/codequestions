# Everything is black and pink. How to fix it?


I tried to load the Terrain Sample Editor, after that several components in the Package Manager gave errors and needed to be updated, I updated and everything turned pink, I tried in
Render Pipeline Converter to press something, but it only got worse and now everything is black and there is not even a Skybox
How can i fix it?
