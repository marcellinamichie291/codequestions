# VBA - PivotFilters.Add - problem with Run-time error 1004 (Application-defined or object-defined)

I have a problem I am not able to crack my head around and I am just newbie with VBA (and prefer M code whenever possible).
I have a excel sheet with a lot of pivot tables, which are all using data in one of the sheets (so without more complex PowerPivot tables), which is being updated (or replaced) on monthly basis.
I am trying to create a VBA script, which will update filter to the most recent month, but that month field is in general (not specifically text/string) format (e.g. 2021-12, 2022-10...).
For the beginning, I am trying to utilize the script to take the value out of the specific cell, and later will try to utilize some dynamic way similar to MAX(Month).
This is the code I am trying to run, currently with only one PivotTable and only for the table where only one (the most recent) Month value is needed:
Sub UpdateMonths()
    If Range("A2").Value = "" Then
        MsgBox ("Missing month value in A2.")
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable3").PivotFields("Month")
        .ClearAllFilters
        .PivotFilters.Add Type:=xlCaptionEquals, Value1:=ActiveSheet.Range("A2").Value
    End With
    
End Sub

Based on the other topics and tutorials I browsed, this syntax should be correct, but I am still getting this 1004 error highlighting the row where is PivotFilters.Add.
Different macro, for e.g. with
ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable2").ChangePivotCache ("PivotTable1")
is working very well without any issues.
Any idea what could causing this Run-time error '1004': Application-defined or object-defined ?
Tried to amend the code or its values, or to use even more complex code which I pick up in the other forums questions, e.g.
Sub Filter()
    Dim MonthToFilter As String
    MonthToFilter = ActiveSheet.Range("A2").Text
    
    If Range("A2").Value = "" Then
        MsgBox ("Missing month value in A2.")
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    Dim Tables As PivotTable, ar, tbl
    ar = Array("PivotTable3", "PivotTable4")
    For Each tbl In ar
        Set Tables = ActiveSheet.PivotTables(tbl)
        With Tables
            .PivotFields ("Month")
            .ClearAllFilters
            .PivotFilters.Add Type:=xlCaptionEquals, Value1:=MonthToFilter
        End With
    Next
        MsgBox "Refilter successful."
End Sub

But it was throwing the same error in the same location.
Many thanks!
