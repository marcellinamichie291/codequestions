# filezilla crash my package manager on ubuntu

I'm trying to update, remove, or reinstall filezilla server on ubuntu 18.04. I'm not sure how it got to this state but I read along somewhere ssh manager screwed up the dependencies for a version of libcrypt.so.1
It thought libcrypt.so.1 was in the /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu folder but its actually in the usr/local/sisis-pap/libxcrypt/lib folder too. It's in both folders. I changed the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory to point toward the second one and the first one and both roots. It still wanted to point to the /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu folder.
Well after trying to remove the library. I got to the point where it only says
sudo apt-get --reinstall install filezilla-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: The package filezilla-server needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.

It'll actually say this for any combination i try for sudo apt-get. I tried a lot of things none of which seems to fix this problem. Any idea how to remove this program of fix this error?
