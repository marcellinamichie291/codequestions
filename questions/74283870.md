I am looking sitemaps for Google Play Store (apps) for scrapring.
I tried looking it up at https://play.google.com/robots.txt. And there are 10 sitemaps listed there. I fetched around 4 million urls from those sitemaps. But all are similar to this url: https://play.google.com/store/books/container/books_clusters_mrl_rt_rb_mt_hn_tcPsAgAAQBAJ.
I couldn't find a single relevant app URL like https://play.google.com/store/apps .
