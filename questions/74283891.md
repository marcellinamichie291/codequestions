# Find min max value of a dataframe within x rows without a loop

I have this dataframe that looks like that:
df = pd.DataFrame([[5, 8],
                   [8, 10],
                   [3, 15],
                   [16, 20],
                   [12, 21],
                   [5, 9],
                   [10, 12],
                   [20, 22],
                   [4, 10],
                   [7, 13],
                   [9, 15],
                   [6, 9]],
                  columns=list("lh"))

I would like to know the min and max within x previous and forward rows for each row but without using a loop, as the df is quite large and it takes a long time.
I have this function that works:
def pivotid(df1, l, n1, n2): #n1 n2 before and after candle L
    if l-n1 < 0 or l+n2 >= len(df1):
        return 0

    pividlow=1
    pividhigh=1
    for i in range(l-n1, l+n2+1):
        if(df1.l[l]>df1.l[i]):
            pividlow=0
        if(df1.h[l]<df1.h[i]):
            pividhigh=0

    if pividlow and pividhigh:
        return 3
    elif pividlow:
        return 1
    elif pividhigh:
        return 2
    else:
        return 0

Here's how I call it:
df['pivot'] = df.apply(lambda x: pivotid(df, x.name, 2, 2), axis=1)

Here's the expected result:
     l   h  pivot
0    5   8      0
1    8  10      0
2    3  15      1
3   16  20      0
4   12  21      2
5    5   9      1
6   10  12      0
7   20  22      2
8    4  10      1
9    7  13      0
10   9  15      0
11   6   9      0

Do you think that there's a way to achieve that without using a for loop with pandas?
