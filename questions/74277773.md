# How to count instances of metric values t(now) vs t(1m) with condition in Prometheus

I have a gauge metric that is getting temperature per minute. I use the following query to check change in temperature value now vs 1min ago.
temperature - temperature offset 1m

I can see the result on timeline as:

I want to calculate the number of times, let's say in 1 hour that the value of change in temperature was more than 5. In this case, it would total to 1 as can be seen from timeline.
I tried the following, but always get Empty query result
(temperature - temperature offset 1m) > 5
