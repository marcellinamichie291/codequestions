# I have a ton of dates (listed as characters in a column) on a .csv file. How do I convert them to dates without having to list all of them?

I'm quite new to R, but I'm especially new to working with dates. I've got a .csv file with a column titled, "Date." Dates are listed as "9_12_22," etc., etc. I see that a lot of solutions use strings to work with dates, like:
strDates <- c("01/05/1965", "08/16/1975")
dates <- as.Date(strDates, "%m/%d/%Y")
And you use the lubridate functions to do so. This makes sense. But I have well over a hundred dates (big psych project) and I need to convert these dates seamlessly and automatically (I'm not going to write out a hundred-variable string!)
What's more is that I'd like to convert these dates to the standard R date format rather than the awkward underscore situation. There's not much I can do to change the .csv file (the output data is set in stone).
#Script example
Data_Dates <- read.csv("myfilename.csv")
I've tried using gsub to get rid of the underscores:
gsub("_", "/", Data_Dates, fixed=TRUE)
This did not work.
I've also tried manually reading in the dates:
Data_Dates <- read.csv("filename.csv") %>%
  select(Date) %>%
  mdy("01_14_2022","01_21_2022","02_03_2022","02_07_2022","02_09_2022","02_16_2022","02_17_2022","02_21_2022","02_24_2022","03_03_2022","03_16_2022","03_21_2022","03_23_2022","03_24_2022","03_25_2022","03_31_2022","04_04_2022","04_06_2022",etc.)


THIS TAKES FOREVER! I quit after a while because it seems futile.
