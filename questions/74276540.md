Unit testing with Viper - Swift
Hello,
I have an Login module(LoginViewController,LoginPresenter,LoginInteractor,LoginRouter)
that I wrote with Viper.
I want to write a unit test for this module but I'm not sure exactly where to start.
Can I get suggestions from people who write unit tests with Viper?
Thank you,
