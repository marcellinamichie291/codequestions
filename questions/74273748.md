# Get mime type of InMemoryUploadedFile without extention in Python

I'm trying to get the mime type of for example a InMemoryUploadedFile JavaScript file without knowing the file extention in Python
Currently i check my InMemoryUploadedFile with in_memory_file.content_type which returns application/octet-stream for a JavaScript file after that i use the Magic lib
magic.Magic(mime=True).from_buffer(in_memory_file.read())

Which returns text/plain.
When uploading a file that contains the .js extention i'm getting the right mime type "text/javascript"
