# Can I refer from a UWP project to a .NET Standard project?

I created an UWP app, and a .NET 6.0 project, and added reference of UWP project to the .NET 6 project.
Output of executing proj.bat file that runs this solution executes the following error:.

Error NU1201: Project MyUWPProject is not compatible with net6.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v6.0). Project MyUWPProject supports
: uap10.0.18362 (UAP,Version=v10.0.18362)

How can fix this? Is what I'm trying to do even possible?
