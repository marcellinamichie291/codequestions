# Advanced Filter NOT Copying Data, only headers - VBA

I have the following code which works on perfectly on my personal pc with the sample data. When I apply the same code to the real data from my work (on company pc) it only copies the headrs of the data. not sure if it helps but the excel file from work is confidential file and I see the message above the A B C D.....
Sub SheetLoop()

 Dim Ws As Worksheet, wb As Workbook, DestSh As Worksheet
 Dim Rng As Range, CRng As Range, DRng As Range, i As Long

  Set wb = ThisWorkbook
 Set DestSh = wb.Worksheets("Report")

 Set CRng = DestSh.Range("L1").CurrentRegion
 Set DRng = DestSh.Range("A3")

 For Each Ws In wb.Worksheets
    If Ws.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
        i = i + 1
        Set Rng = Ws.Range("A1").CurrentRegion
        
        Rng.AdvancedFilter xlFilterCopy, CRng, DRng
        If i > 1 Then DRng.Cells(1).EntireRow.Delete xlUp  'delete the first row of the copied range, except the first case
        Set DRng = DestSh.Range("A" & DestSh.Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(1) 'reset the range where copying to
    End If
 Next Ws
 
 MsgBox "Ready..."
End Sub
