# Connect to Mac M1 from AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance?

I am trying to connect from my ec2 ubuntu instance to a program running on mac m1.
I keeping getting timeout error.
I checked my IPv4 ip using: whatismyipaddress.com
Checked to make sure port is open and listening using:
netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'

Result:

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)     rhiwat shiwat    pid   epid  state    options


tcp46      0      0  *.1234                 .                    LISTEN      131072 131072  96170      0 0x0100 0x00000006

Not sure about what to check next. Do I need to add the ip of remote client in allowed connections somewhere on mac?
I have turned off the firewall for now.
Edit:
I have added a port forwarding rule in the router admin page.
Rule:
192.xxx.0.xxx   4001    TCP+UDP     1xx.xx.27.227   1-6553  Enabled

Not sure what exactly to change in the firewall on router. Dlink.
