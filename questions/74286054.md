# Split a string into prefixes of other string

I have a seemingly easy problem that I'm struggling to solve.
Basically I have two string s, t and I'd like to split s into prefixes of t.
For example, let s = "abcababc" and t = "abc", then the splitting I want would be abc|ab|abc since the splits are prefixes of t.
I'm using Java as a language, but pseudocode will do the job as well.
Thank you.
I tried thinking recursive but didn't come up with a solution.
