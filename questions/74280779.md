# react-activity-feed: How to over ride the activity update on submit

I'm using the react-activities-feed components to manage the user side of feeds for our web app.  The documentation is very lacking and I'm trying to figure out how to customize how the  with a custom callback for making the post.  I think it's the doRequest property, but I'm not 100% sure.
Has anyone done this?  If so, how is it structured?
