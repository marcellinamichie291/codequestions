I'm using NAT to provide traffic to nginx gateway in some microservice network. NAT code is below:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.127:80
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 10.10.0.127 --dport 80 -j SNAT --to-source <NAT local IP>

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.127:443
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 10.10.0.127 --dport 443 -j SNAT --to-source <NAT local IP>

And in nginx I'm getting client address to logs via $remote_addr header. After traffic going through NAT, $remote_addr becomes NAT's local IP address, but I want to get client's address to logs.
I don't mind reconfiguring both NAT or nginx, using other nginx headers etc.
Thanks for the answer!
I basically tried to change NAT code to
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.127:80
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 10.10.0.127 --dport 80 -j SNAT --to-source <NAT public IP>

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.127:443
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 10.10.0.127 --dport 443 -j SNAT --to-source <NAT public IP>

but after that routing to services failed.
