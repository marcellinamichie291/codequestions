# A function works fine with one number, but not an array. What am I missing?

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm very new to coding in python. I have a pretty simple function; it just needs to make a calculation based on b's relative location to a and c:
a = 6
b = 3
c = 2

def function(a, b, c):
    if ((a >= b) & (b >= c)):
        return b - c 
    elif ((a <= b) & (b >= c)):
        return a - c
    else:
        return 0 
t = function(a, b, c)
print(t)

When I run it with simple numbers like above, it gives me the right answer no matter what I make b. (In this case 1)
But When I run it with a,b, and c as Numpy Arrays, it only returns b - c across the entire "t" array.
It's not too much different, but here's what I'm using for the array version:
def function(a, b, c):
    if ((a >= b) & (b >= c)).any():
        return b - c 
    elif ((a <= b) & (b >= c)).any():
        return a - c
    else:
        return 0 
t = function(a, b, c[i>1])
print(t)

(The [i>1] is there because there is a variable amount of array input, and another function will be used for when [i = 0])
I've also tried this:
t = np.where(((prev2 >= Head_ELV) & (Head_ELV >= Bottom_ELV)).any, Head_ELV - Bottom_ELV, 0)
but ran into the same result.
Would a while-loop work better?
