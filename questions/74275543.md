# mysql opening / closing wrong when order by date

Correct
SELECT DATE(A.date) as date, 
@balance as opening,
(CASE WHEN B.type_id = 1 THEN (B.amount) ELSE 0 END) as debit,
(CASE WHEN B.type_id = 2 THEN (B.amount) ELSE 0 END) as credit,
@balance := @balance + (CASE WHEN type = 1 THEN (1 * (B.amount)) ELSE (-1 * (B.amount)) END) as closing
FROM request A 
LEFT JOIN item B 
ON A.id = B.request_id
CROSS JOIN (SELECT @balance := 0) tmp
