# stratified sampling in ray tracing - nothing is changed

I have tried to implement stratified sampling in my ray tracer. But nothing is changed.
First I simply change my sampler from
while (s ++ < 100)
          sampling(v, x, y);

to
while (s ++ < 10) 
{
        t = 0;
    while (t ++ < 10)
        stratified_sampling(v, x, y, s, t);
}

and in the sampling function,
u = ((double)x + random_double(0, 1))
v = ((double)y + random_double(0, 1))

this code changed to
u = ((double)x + ((double)s + random_double(0, 1)) / 10)
v = ((double)y + ((double)t + random_double(0, 1)) / 10)

so the 100 sampling should be done in the 10 x 10 grid in one pixel as i expected.

but the result image is not changed at all, at least in my opinion. what's the problem? Is it normal?? (first one is before stratified sampling)
