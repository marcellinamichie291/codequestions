I have a sequence that needs to be an output.. which is 8
so what i did (with a help of a friend of course.. bec i'm not smart and have adhd.. is this:
let a = 1;
let b = 1;
let c = a + b;
a = b; // 1
b = c; // 2
c = a + b; // 3
a = b; // a = 2
b = c; // b = 3
c = a + b; // 2 + 3 = 5    c = 5

what i need next, is to make a for loop, that will calculate it to 8 (perform the exact same calc task as above
(a = b and b = c and c = a + b)
to make the function get print an output of 8..
let a = 1;
let b = 1;
let c = a + b;
a = b; // 1
b = c; // 2
c = a + b; // 3
a = b; // a = 2
b = c; // b = 3
c = a + b; // 2 + 3 = 5    c = 5
function calc () {
    for (let i=0; i<= ( ? ? ? ? ? ?); i++){
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
calc()
