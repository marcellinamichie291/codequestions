# Does strlen() returns unsigned long or integer in c++

when i tried to put the returned value of strlen to a integer variable, error pops out.
int length = strlen(/*char* */fstring).
I could put (int)strlen(/*char* */fstring) to correct my problem, but I just wonder what is the type of returned value. Is it because c allows it but c++ doesnot?
