# What 'type' of Language is JavaScript?

Programming languages are often classified by their structure.  To date there are many types, including (but not limited to!): Procedural, Structured, Object-Oriented, Concurrent, Functional, Event-Driven, Compiled, and Interpreted (Source).  Some programming languages are a mixture of these constructs, while others may fall under only one of the headings listed above.
My question is:
What type of language can JavaScript be classified as?
