# VScode Syntax Highlighting Problem from Microsoft C# Extension

I have a problem with the VScode code highlighting where the colour of the line under sort of reflects the line above (Some parts of it copies the colours from above). I discovered this while programming in C#, I opened the project and the highlighting was messed up.
I've tried restarting VScode and changing themes to no avail. So that left one possible source of the problems; extensions. Using trial and error, I have pin pointed the cause to the issue of being the Microsoft C# extension.
I need the C# extension to be able to program in C# so I'm not sure of what to do from here.
