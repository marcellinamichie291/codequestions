# multiple python lists to table rows in HTML

I have multiple lists created in python. I am trying to convert these lists into HTML rows.
week = ['1','2']
date = ['2022-10-01','2022-10-09']

My HTML table should look like below:
Week     Date
1        2022-10-01
2        2022-10-09

what I tried so far:


{% for val in data %}
<tr>
  <td>
    {% for item in val.week %} {{ item }} <br> {% endfor %}
  </td>
  <td>
    {% for item in val.date %} {{ item }} <br> {% endfor %}
  </td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}



The problem with above code is every value is treated as cell instead of row and hence I am unable to apply any row related styles to the above.
Could someone help with how to convert these to rows instead of cells.
Thank you.
