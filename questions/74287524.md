# Split Array by , but only if there is no space after it

I know this is a simple task but I can't get my head around it today.
Here's my array
["JB Racing (JBRA01)","Bloggs, Joe (BLOG01)","Ryder, Sean  (RYDE01)","Bleeth, Jasmin (BLET01)","Knightrider (KNIG01)"]

I wish to split the array by a ',' but as you can see, some of the items have a ',' within the item. The only difference is that the ',' separating the items has no space after it. I need to split the array but keeping the items intact.
i.e.
"JB Racing (JBRA01)"
"Bloggs, Joe (BLOG01)"
"Ryder, Sean  (RYDE01)"
"Cranky, Jimmy (BLET01)"
"Knightrider (KNIG01)"
