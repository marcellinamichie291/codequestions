# How can I detect Client side large file download progress or status from server side using PHP

Lot's of solution saw before but not exactly specific. Need some specific solution.
Is it a possible answer:
When starting the download of the file :
–Detect Client side destination of file download and unique file name.
-If we can continuously check of that destination of client side downloaded file  size is equal to server side given  file size .
–That we can tell surely file is downloaded now.
But how!
How to track client download progress(fail/cancel or success) from server side ???
