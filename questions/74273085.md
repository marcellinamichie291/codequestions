# Limit particles number in particles-js in javascript

I can't get my particles number to reduce at 500px breakpoint. I am using javascript, as I need to stop the animation after a while.
window.onload = function () {
  var particles = Particles.init({
    selector: ".background",
    color: ["#03dac6", "#fac561", "#000000"],


    connectParticles: true,
    responsive: [
      {
        breakpoint: '500px',
        options: {
          color: ["#faebd7", "#03dac6", "#fac561"],
        }
      }
    ]
  });
 setTimeout(function() {particles.pauseAnimation()}, 15000); 
};
