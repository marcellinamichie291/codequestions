# How can I wrap a paragraph to be exactly a set amount of characters in length?

I have a chunk of text I'm pulling from an API and I want to pretty print it so that every line is exactly n characters in length.
I'm using python and tried the textwrap library but the problem I've had with that is that sometimes the line of text will be less than n characters in length with no whitespace padding.
My code looks like this
from tabulate import tabulate
import textwrap

tabulate.PRESERVE_WHITESPACE = True


s = [long line here]

strlen = 64

s = textwrap.fill(
    s,
    strlen,
    replace_whitespace=False,
    break_long_words=True,
    break_on_hyphens=False,
)


print(tabulate([[s]], tablefmt="jira"))

I'm printing out a series of these textboxes and it would look awkward if they were of different sizes.
Is there an option I'm not seeing in the textwrap library or maybe a way I can extend the library to get it to do what I want? If not, I'm okay making my own function to do the job.
