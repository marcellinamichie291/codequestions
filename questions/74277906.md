# My pycharm version does not support "match" statements

Iam using pycharm for making an app and I used the command "match" . it shows the current version does not support match statements, I tried updating.
I updated python but PyCharm shows that it is on the latest version.
I updated Python to 3.11.0 (before it was 3.9)
