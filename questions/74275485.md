# Python Latex Library

I often work with groups of materials and my file/materials are named as alphanumeric strings. Is there a library to turn a string like r"Mxene - Ti3C2" to latex styled r"Mxene - Ti$_\mathrm{3}$C$_\mathrm{2}$"?
I usually use a dictionary but going through every name is a hassle and prone to error because materials can always be added or removed from the study.
I know that I can use str.maketrans() to generate subscripts but I haven't had very consistent results using the output with matplotlib so I'd much rather use latex.
