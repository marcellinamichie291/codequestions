# What is a proper way to store drawables in the Room Library? Android, Kotlin, XML

I'm beginner in Android development and now developing my application that helps me to keep track of my personal finances. All my categories (food, shopping, etc) have a displayed color and icon (XML drawable) that should be stored inside Room database:

What datatype or method should I use in order to store those icons inside my Room database?
This is my current implementation of the Category Entity:
@Entity(tableName = "category")
data class Category(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    var id: Int? = null,
    @ColumnInfo(name = "name")
    var name: String?,
    @ColumnInfo(name = "expanses")
    var expanses: Double?,
    @ColumnInfo(name = "icon")
    var icon: Int?,
    @ColumnInfo(name = "color")
    var color: Int?)

I'm using this Icon Picker in my app.
