# User permissions for same account

Just wanted to clarify that we are talking about our customers as user (not back office employees).  We acquired business OLB customers during a recent merger.  Those customers were used to be able to add an accountant, office managers, etc. that just had inquiry-only rights but did not have access to conduct transactions on the account.  We converted them to Banno for consumer as we are still waiting for Banno for business.  From what we know in Banno consumer, anyone that has access to the account in OLB has full access and there is not a way to provided limited rights.  In talking with Eric Arnold from JHA, his team believed there was a way we could control this in Banno consumer.
User also referenced contact with Rob Loethen.
From my understanding thus far, there isn't the option have different user abilities for each signer on the account within Banno People.
I need to clarify if what the FI is asking, is an option in Banno. Any input would be appreciated. :)
