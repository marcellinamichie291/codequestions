# alternative to useMatch in javascript

I am trying to remove react-router-dom dependency in my project
I am trying to look for replacing "useMatch" from react-router-dom to javascript
import { useMatch } from 'react-router-dom'

export cost useFolder = ():Folder => {
//get the current folder or folder id
const match = useMatch('/folder/:folderid')
}

Is this right way to do
const match = window.location.pathname('/folder/:folderid')
