# VSTO Outlook: Detect when explorer or inspector window are not shown as the topmost

Well, every time I need to do things in my Outlook Add-in using VSTO I always get problems, limitations, restrictions, etc.....
Having said that... Now I am trying to detect when explorer or inspector window are not visible as the topmost.
For example, I have a custom task pane which I catch any visibility change through the correspondent VisibleChanged event. This event is triggered when its visibility changes from true to false or vice versa or when the custom task pane is closed for any reason. When the custom task pane is not visible I do some stuff.
The problem I have is the following:
If I am in the explorer or inspector window and I click on the Outlook "File" tab/menu, the current view changes and the explorer and inspector are not the topmost (they are not visible) and the worst, the custom task pane VisibleChanged event is triggered.... so in this use case I do not want to do those stuffs when custom task pane is not visible. How can I detect this particular use case? I mean when explorer or inspector window are not displayed as the topmost.
