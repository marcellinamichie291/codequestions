# HTTP status code for resource that is not available yet

I have a DB table with a report_url column. As soon as a backend done with filling and storing a report it fills that column with S3 link. If the report was not yet stored, the column value is NULL by default. I also have Pyramid API where an endpoint is declared returning Response with body of report content. So, whenever the user makes request, according controller will be fired to get the report link and download the file and return it to user. However, if report is not done yet (report_url is NULL), I need to inform the user somehow. In this case front-end should receive HTTP status 400, but I have not figured out if this fits best. Or maybe 503 fits better here?
