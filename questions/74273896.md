# script on collider should scale another object

Im working on a 2D game and im trying to make a foggy effect.
I have made a sprite as cameramask, that is a chield of the camera.
It works ok
I made a emty gameobject with a triggercollider, with a script attached. I want to make it look like the fog(cameramask) is disappering slowly.
I can scale it up, till it seems that the fog is gone, and then destroy the cameramask. But if the script is on my collider, it just scale up the collider.
Is there a way to have the script on the collider, and make it scale another object (cameramask), when collider it hit.

public int startSize = 3;
    public int minSize = 1;

    public float maxSize = 6f;
    private float currScale;
    public float speed = 2.0f;
   
    public GameObject remove;
    
    private Vector3 targetScale;
    private Vector3 baseScale;
    

    void Start()
    {
        baseScale = transform.localScale;
        transform.localScale = baseScale * startSize;
        currScale = startSize;
        targetScale = baseScale * startSize;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        transform.localScale = Vector3.Lerp(transform.localScale, targetScale, speed * Time.deltaTime);
        currScale = Mathf.Clamp(currScale, minSize, maxSize +.5f);

        targetScale = baseScale * currScale;
        currScale+=0.5f;
        Checkscale();
    }
         
    private void Checkscale()
    {
        if (currScale > 4)
        {
            Destroy(remove);
        }    
    }
