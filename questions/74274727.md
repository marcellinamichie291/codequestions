# liquibase :: is it possible to remove <validCheckSum> tags programmatically(JAVA)

in liquibase, the incrementby attribute in addautoincrement tag throws validation error in 4.16.1 version. I had to remove the incrementby attribute, which changed the md5sum.
To tackle that I had added <validCheckSum>1:any</validCheckSum> for now.
I plan to delete the md5sum and let it populate in all the environments by itself.
What I need now is how can I remove the  <validCheckSum>1:any</validCheckSum> tags programmatically once it is no longer required.
