# Regex matching a line and some lines before if line starts with a specific char

I am processing an electronic circuit netlist in python and I am attempting to match all of a certain type of cell. Cell instantiations in a spice file can span multiple lines by using "+". For example...
(example 1):
instance_name_here pin1 pin2 pin3
+ pin4 pin5 my_cell_name_here

is equivalent to (example 2):
instance_name_here pin1 pin2 pin3 pin4 pin5 my_cell_name_here

Say my spice file has 30 of these cells, some of which are all on one line like example 1, some are on two lines like example 2, or some can even be on as many as 7 lines (if I have a "+" after each net)!
I want to match all different ways the cell with name "my_cell_name_here" could appear.
Right now I know how to match my cell if it appears on one line. Basically, my match returns all lines that end in my_cell_name_here. see as follows:
mymatch = re.findall(".*" + my_cell_name_here + "$", spicenetlist,flags=re.MULTILINE) 
I am not sure how I should approach looking backwards. I tried the following:
mymatch = re.findall("(.*\n\+)*" + ".*" + voltage_cell_name + "$", spicenetlist,flags=re.MULTILINE) 
That produced output worse than what I had before...
I was expecting match = anything+newline+"+"+ a line that ends with voltage_cell_name.
Instead when I printed the match I got as follows: ['','','']
any suggestions would be appreciated.
