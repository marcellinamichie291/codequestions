# How do I check if my machine supports floating point textures and how many floating point bits it supports?

I wrote a program using PixiJS with floating point textures that worked fine on my computer, but I had an error when I moved it to another computer.
I created a floating point texture using PixiJS' RenderTexture class and tried to do something with the image on Mesh. Everything worked fine on my computer, but there were a lot of strange noises on the other one.
RenderTexture.create({ width: originTexture.width, height: originTexture.height, type: TYPES.FLOAT })

When PixiJS is initialized, it prints information that says WebGL2 is used.
So I guess the cause of the problem may be the graphics card.
So how do I use JavaScript to check if the graphics card supports floating point textures and how many floating point bits it supports?
Or if you have any other ideas, please let me know. Thank you!
