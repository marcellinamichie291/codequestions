# Single result from database using mysqli

I am trying to use mySQLi for the first time. I have done it in the case of loop. Loop results are showing but I am stuck when I try to show a single record. Here is loop code that is working.
<?php
// Connect To DB
$hostname="localhost";
$database="mydbname";
$username="root";
$password="";

$conn = mysqli_connect($hostname, $username, $password, $database);
?>

<?php
$query = "SELECT ssfullname, ssemail FROM userss ORDER BY ssid";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
$num_results = mysqli_num_rows($result);
?>

<?php
/*Loop through each row and display records */
for($i=0; $i<$num_results; $i++) {
$row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
?>

Name: <?php print $row['ssfullname']; ?>
<br />
Email: <?php print $row['ssemail']; ?>
<br /><br />

<?php 
// end loop
} 
?>

How do I show a single record, any record, name, or email, from the first row or whatever, just a single record, how would I do that?
In a single record case, consider all the above loop part removed and let's show any single record without a loop.
