# I need help getting files from a folder on the server and using their path as the source for my video tag

Basically what I've got planned here is this
let vid1 = /videos/introduction.mp4
let vid2 = /videos/explanation.mp4
let vid3 = /videos/conclusion.mp4


*// Next video function*


let video_count = 1

if (nextBtn.addEventListener) {
  nextBtn.addEventListener("click", nextVideo, false);
} else {
  nextBtn.attachEvent('onclick'. nextVideo)
}

function nextVideo(){
  video_count++;
  if(video_count == 16) video_count = 1;
  let nextVid  = "vid"+video_count
  video.src = nextVid;
}

*//Previous video function*

previousBtn.addEventListener("click", prevVideo)
function prevVideo(){
  video_count--;
  if(video_count == 0) video_count = 1;
  let prevVid = "vid"+video_count    // here i see the problem but i cant work around it
  video.src = prevVid
}

in both let = nextVid and let = prevVid i want it so that the video source is set to the vid2 variable but it displays it as .../videos/vid2 but that's not want I want. I want it to be .../videos/explanation.mp4 . Removing the quotation marks would make vid undefined but if I try to define it I won't know what to code from there as I'm not familiar with arrays.
Used the code from here
HTML5 video previous - next and auto play
I also tried using Node.js but I don't know how to display the directory listing onto the server. So I resorted to the code above. Which i also don't have experience.
I'm just starting out JS and I understand it pretty well and still learning so corrections and criticism are greatly appreciated
