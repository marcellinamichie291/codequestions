# Pandas keep decimal part of values like .998344 after round(2) applied to series

I have dataset with float values with 6 decimals. I need to round it to two decimals.The problem becams with some floats nearly close to 1. After applying round(2) I got 1.00 instead of 0.99. May be this is mathematically right, but I need to have values like 0.99. My customer needs two decimals as result, I cant change it.
ones_list = [0.998344, 0.996176, 0.998344, 0.998082]
df = pd.DataFrame(ones_list, columns=['value_to_round'])
df['value_to_round'].round(2)
