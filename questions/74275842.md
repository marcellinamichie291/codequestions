I have a problem with taking photo by webcam (or phone camera) into database using Javascript and drawImage() function on webpage.
All scripts and manuals I found are using some fixed values for width and height which are used when the photo is stored to database. Like this:
<video id="video" width="640" height="480" autoplay></video>
<button id="snap">Snap Photo</button>
<canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>

...
// save image 
   $('button#save-image-capture').click( async function() {
                                    
   context.drawImage(video, 0, 0, 640, 480);
   video.style.display = 'none';
   canvas.style.display = 'inline-block';
   videoStream.getTracks()[0].stop();
   var vImg =canvas.toDataURL();
   var lSpinner$;
   lSpinner$ = apex.util.showSpinner( $( '#' + p_item1 ) );
   await Save2Collection(p_ajex, vImg,p_itmId,p_item1);
   lSpinner$.remove();
                                });

Is it possible to read in some way a resolution of phone camera (eg. 3000x4000), and use it to store the photo with genuine dimensions?
How to avoid rescaling of image?
Maybe I didn't understood the concept of web based capturing. Is it posible to use camera, like in mobile phone, or it have to be set to fixed size of video/canvas no matter what are settings of camera?
