# Are block scope variables are immediately removed from memory?

If we are defining variables inside if else block or while block, are this variables immediately going to deleted after block ends? what happens behind the scene?
int foo()
{
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
    {
       int x=i;
       System.out.println(x);
    }
}

when x variable will be deleted from memory?
