# consume all files in Apache Camel pollEnrich

Is there any way or property in pollEnrich which help us to consume all files at once. I can't use from because its already being used for timer. 2 from are not allowed in a single route.
Here is my Code...!
            from("timer://foo")
            .pollEnrich("file:src")
            .aggregate(new ZipAggregationStrategy()).constant(false)
            .completionFromBatchConsumer().eagerCheckCompletion()
            .setHeader(Exchange.FILE_NAME, simple("file"+".zip"))
            .to("file:src/test/java/out");

Thanks in Advanced !
My need is simple. I want the all files in src to be zipped in a folder. But pollEnrich is consuming file one at a time... which is causing problem
