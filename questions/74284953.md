# How to use Vaadin as a Wildfly module

I noticed that the Vaadin JARs take up a sizeable percentage of my test application WAR file size, does anyone have any experiences on using vaadin dependencies as a wildfly module and just referencing it from the application?
I'm currently using vaadin 14.6.1 and wildfly 24.0.1.
I tried to use vaadin with the scope provided in my maven project, but oddly I couldn't compile the frontend dependencies doing this, I was getting this error:
 Execution default of goal com.vaadin:vaadin-maven-plugin:14.6.1:build-frontend fa
iled: Unable to compute frontend dependencies: com.vaadin.flow.router.Route -> [Help 1]

What I expect at the end is to have a WAR file without the vaadin JARs, and then put those JARs somewhere where the wildfly could load them as dependencies of the WAR.
I would like to have some direction to the right path and know if there's any working solution to accomplish this.
Thanks in advance
