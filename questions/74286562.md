# How use two column values on a dataframe and store the result in a new one

I want to choose two column values for example bananas (from column "fruit") who are not from Italy (from column "country of origin") and store it in a new dataframe.
approach:
a = df[(df['fruit'] == "banana") & (df['country of origin'] != "Italy")].index
df.drop(a, inplace=True)

When I run this code I get this error message:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

I would be very grateful for help.
