# PGSQL - DROP EXTENSION then CREATE EXTENSION of updated custom extension installs previously dropped extension

I am trying to update a custom extension in pgsql with the updated SQL & control files.
My process was to drop the extension & then re-create it after installing the updated files & deleting the old in /share/postgresql/13/extension/ directory.
When I run:
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS extension_1.0 CASCADE;

It drops it.
Then I proceed to create the new extension:
CREATE EXTENSION extension_1.1 SCHEMA heb;

When I check List of extension, it shows the old extension is installed & when I check in database, I still see the old functions.
Is there a cache that I need to clear in postgres to add my new extension?
