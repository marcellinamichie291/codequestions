# docker compose vs docker-compose vs docker stack and env variables

my situation is quite simple: i have a docker-compose file which simplified looks like:
version: '3.6'

services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu
    command: 'printenv'
    environment:
      BAR_ENV: "${FOO_ENV:-admin:$2y$05$kSCGQdzsuy1.htrJp.lqsOZjmF1fuDE9AURnk7szE5poFJ9gY7uPO}"


I need to make it working for all 3 possible deployment scenarios:

docker-compose
docker stack -c file-name.yml deploy stack-name
docker compose

until now i had to deal only with "docker-compose" & "docker stack deploy"  variants and all was fine
but now i have a requirement to support "docker compose" for the same file and it doesn't work:
dollar git:(release/3375.0) ✗ docker-compose up

obviously if i add extra $ like in this hint, then it works only for "docker compose" but for "docker-compose" doesn't

i played with env files to store default value of variable but it doesn't work with "docker stack"
so is there a common technique that will be supported everywhere  ?
