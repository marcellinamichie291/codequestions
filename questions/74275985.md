# How to not update columns in Sequelize v6 if they have not been changed in the incoming data?

In version 5 I could do this
const data = {
  userId: 1,
  login: 'admin',
};
const { userId, ...userData } = data;
const candidate = await findById(userId);
const record = await candidate.update({ ...userData });
return record;

If the user already had an "admin" login, then the update request was not executed.
Now I have updated to 6 versions, and this feature is gone. Whatever data I place, the update request is executed anyway.
