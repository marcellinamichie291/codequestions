# How to use NIH API inside R

I am trying to get some data from a project using API. In this case I need to set NIH API to get information. I need to use findDrugInteractions rest point but I do not have idea on how to set the extraction. I only know that I need httr to get the data and jsonlite to format it. This is the link of the API:
https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/APIs/api-Interaction.findDrugInteractions.html
In the help options there is an example:
https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/interaction/interaction.json?rxcui=88014&sources=ONCHigh
This API uses rxcui (a code) to get the data. In the case of previous example is 88014. But I do not know how to replicate this example using R.
Can anybody please help me? Many thanks!
