# Moment.tz().format is returning wrong date

I have a date in String format as follows:
const date = "2022-11-01 17:11:38"
I want to apply a previously selected Timezone so this value would parse to the selected timezone: Pacific
The moment.js documentation says that i should use the following:
return moment(date).tz('Pacific').format('MMM D YYYY, hh:mma');

The result of this conversion is: Nov 2 2022, 12:11pm
This is wrong, this should be Nov 2 2022, 10:11am
Using a different approach:
moment.tz(date, 'Pacific').format('MMM D YYYY, hh:mma');

returns Nov 1 2022, 05:11pm. Seems no change was made from the original date.
What could be missing here?
