# Google Analytics (GA4) transaction data not accurate

1. Background
Using GA4 without GA360
2. Description
When i want to search the records by transactional level (Record by datetime) which will show the detailed record one by one, the event count is varied following by filtered date.
3. Hope to Achieve
I would like to achieve a normal report that will show every event count as 1 by filtering months or longer.
4. Weird Cases

Event count of every record is 1 when filtering 0.5 month, eg 1 Oct to 16 Oct.
Event count of every record is 2 when filtering 1 month, eg 1 Oct to 30 Oct.
Event count of every record is 3 when filtering 1.5 month, eg 15 Sep to 30 Oct.

5. Supporting
It is the sampling data from reports.
Heavily Sampled exploration
