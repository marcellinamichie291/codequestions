# After checkout to another branch and use git pull,Git merge files from previous branch

I have a following code in Jenkins which help me making a patch
git -C $PROJECT fetch
strTmp=$(git -C $PROJECT diff origin/$BRANCH..origin/master --name-only)
echo "strTmp = $strTmp"

if [ -n "$strTmp" ]; then
                
git -C $PROJECT reset --hard
git -C $PROJECT checkout $BRANCH
git -C $PROJECT pull

But from time to time i see what previous branch was merged in my local branch
HEAD is now at dac33 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into release/DEV-11111
branch 'release/DEV-19999' set up to track 'origin/release/DEV-19999'.
Switched to a new branch 'release/DEV-19530'
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.

Above files a merged from release/DEV-11111 and it's merged when git pull command are executed.
But why?
I was switched to another branch, why files from DEV-11111 are merged into my current branch?
I expected to only files from branch which we switched to are updated from remote
