# Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement MetaTrader5 doesn't work on Windows

I want to try MetaTrader5 programming with python,
in python file i have import MetaTrader5. But it's not possible to download that packages.
I tried to run this command on windows.
python -m pip install MetaTrader5

But it's just doesn't work. I tried to search internet. Everywhere is mention about MetaTrader5 doesn't work with python on linux, only on windows. But i'm trying it on Windows 11. Is there any way how to solve it?
I have python version 3.11
