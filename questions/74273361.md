In node.js
I am trying to get the mime type of of a file but it is returning type based on its extension. I also tried multiple NPM Libraries but it also not able to determined the true mime type.
By true type what I meant is suppose if I rename the file 'Notpad.exe' to 'Notepad.png' then checked the file type then it will return image/png which is not correct. right?
So I am stuck here. Please help!
It will be a great help if we can extract the file mime type without using any library.
I have tried various lib:-

mmmagic - > but it is last updated 4 years ago. so I can not use it.
mime-type
stream-mmmagic
Buffered-filetype

Also npm file-type library is only supported for ESM project.
