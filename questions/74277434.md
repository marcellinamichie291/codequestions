# SqlAlchemy DO NOT connect to DB on import module when reflecting models

Could anyone help me with sqlalchemy reflecting.
I have a module reflecting.py with reflecting models but I want to make sqlalchemy do not connect to DB on import statement and implement something like init_models() method to trigger connecting.
# reflecting.py
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

Base = declarative_base()
engine = create_engine('db_uri')
metadata = MetaData(schema='shema_name', bind=engine)

class User(Base):
    """
    Reflecting User model
    """
    __table__ = Table(
        'users',
        metadata,
        autoload=True,
        autoload_with=engine
    )
    address = relationship('Address', back_populates='user')


class Address(Base):
    """
    Reflecting Address model
    """
    __table__ = Table(
        'addresses',
        metadata,
        autoload=True,
        autoload_with=engine
    )
    user = relationship('User', back_populates='address')

So I want to be able to import this module sucessfully even when no DB connection.
To make it possible I'd like to have something like init_models() function which will trigger connecting to DB and initialyze all other things.
Expected usage:
import reflecting

reflecting.init_models()

# models usage here

How to organize the code to make it?
Thanks for any advice!
