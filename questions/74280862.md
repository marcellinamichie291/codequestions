# Why this code doesn't display all chars in the file ? I tried also getc() and fscanf(); aslo doesn't not worked. look at the screen shot?

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>



int main()
{
    char str[1];
    FILE *file;
    file = fopen("dataloger.txt", "rb");    
    while(fread(&str[0], sizeof(str),  1, file) ==1){
        if(str[0] =='\n'){
            str[0] = '#';
        } 
        printf("%s", str);     
    }
    fclose(file);

/************************************************
    int c; 
    if (file) {
        while ((c = getc(file)) != EOF){
            if(c =='\n') {
                c = '#';
            }
            printf("%c", c);
        }     

        fclose(file);
    }


could someone explain why I didn't see normal output not just #?
As I faced the problem only after I try to replace the char'\n' by another char and print it.
Look at the screen shot added
