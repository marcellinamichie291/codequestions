# Anisble conditionals if package version

I wrote a simple role to detect certain package from all servers, and a software version:
- name: check installed software
  package_facts:
    manager: auto

- name: check installed version
  set_fact:
    software_version_installed: "{{ ansible_facts.packages['somePackage']| map(attribute='version') | first }}"
    with_dict: "{{ ansible_facts.packages['somePackage'] }}"
  register: openssl_versions


- name: Save to file
  delegate_to: localhost
  local_action:
    module: lineinfile
    dest: "/tmp/someList.txt"
    line: "{{ ansible_hostname }} : {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }} : {{ ansible_facts.packages['somePackage']| map(attribute='version') | first }}"
  when: # HERE IM STUCKED


How I can write a conditional, that find only packages with version greater than f.e 2.X
Tried to find it in docs, but without any success.
I know that, there is no problem to save all to the file, and just grep it.
All I expected is just a file with simple output:
hostname : ipv4 : package version
