# Android, Kotlin: Handler.post vs coroutines

I use Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).post(runnable) which places the query on the end of the thread queue instead of running it immediately. Is it ok to use this with kotlin, or is it better to use coroutines now. Or in these cases, you can leave it like that?
Please, help me
