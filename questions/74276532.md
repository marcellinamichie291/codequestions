# App Engine matching any "subdomain" to my service

I have a Strapi application on Google App Engine as the Default service.
The default URL App Engine generates is https://my-project.uc.r.appspot.com
When I create any other version for my default service or deploy another service, the new URLs would be something like: https://[identifier]-dot-my-project.uc.r.appspot.com
My problem is that if I replace [identifier] with anything at all it opens my Strapi Application root page.
I don't think this has anything to do with Strapi at all, it's probably a feature of App Engine.
My question is: How do I stop this from happening? I want only proper URLs to be matched. That is, if I create a "dev" version, I should be able to access it with the following URL: https://dev-dot-my-project.uc.r.appspot.com, but I don't want any other URL to be matched, like: https://12345-dot-my-project.uc.r.appspot.com
I am using a Standard Environment with the default app.yaml from Strapi docs
runtime: nodejs16

instance_class: F2

env_variables:
  HOST: '0.0.0.0'
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
  DATABASE_NAME: 'strapi'
  DATABASE_USER: 'postgres'
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: '<password>'
  INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME: '<instance_identifier>'

beta_settings:
  cloud_sql_instances: '<instance_identifier>'


When the app is deployed to App Engine, the app.yaml is automatically modified to add some default params.
runtime: nodejs16
env: standard
instance_class: F2
handlers:
  - url: .*
    script: auto

I thought maybe this url: .* was the cause of this and tried to change it to url: /.* (Docs), but App Engine still add the url: .* again anyway at the end and it will have both handlers.
