# Forbidden AWS managed grafana /saml/acs url

In a project, I am using SAML authentication to connect AWS managed grafana to an Identity provider via keycloak as Identity broker.
While getting saml response back on https://<some-grafana-url>/saml/acs I am getting forbidden with error
{"message":"Failed to determine the state of the SSO redirect"}

I have checked NameIdPolicy Format in SAML Request is same as NameId Format under Subject in SAML response.
Certificate is also valid.
What else can lead to this error?
