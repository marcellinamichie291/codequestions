# JSDoc Highlighting not working in inline <script> tags, but working in `.js` files, without a package.json

My first encounter with JSDoc, wanted to use it to get Intellisense for 'style' attribute on an HTMLElement returned from a querySelector. The Editor is VSCode.
For this project I'm using a single HTML file, with inline styles and inline scripts, but when I try to add a JSDoc style comment to the inline <script> tag, it looks/behaves like a normal comment, plain grey, but suggestions for 'style' attribute seem to be working.

I've tried it in .js files in the same project, seems to be working just fine.
Is the absence of highlighting expected behavior in VSCode, and if so, can I enable it for inline scripts in some way?
