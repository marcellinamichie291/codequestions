# How to draw 100 concentric circles (with four changing attributes) with a for loop

Using p5.js, I want to create 100 concentric circles that do the below:

Draw initial circle:

choose size based on 0.8 x width
start at color 1 (based on HSB color mode)
start at opacity 0.01 (based on HSB color mode )
start at shade 100 (based on HSB color mode)).


Draw next circle:

size to be 0.98 x previous circle size
color to progress by 1
opacity to increase by 0.01
shade to decrease by 1



I understand how to do this manually by drawing 100 circles with different inputs, but I want to wrap this all up in a for loop. I can get one parameter to change within the for loop but my expertise unfortunately stops there, I am very beginner. If I try hang the other parameters off the same for loop it gets really complex and something seems to break, and I don't quite understand how nested for loops work if that's what I need to do. Thank you for help in advance!
This is what I have tried so far with just 10 circles:


function setup() {
  createCanvas(1000, 1000);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100, 100);
}

function draw() {
 
  background(0, 0, 100); // white background
  
  for (let i = width; i >= 0; i = i - width/10) {  
    
    noStroke();
    
    let colour = (i/1000)*360;
    let shade = i/10;
    let opacity = ((i/10)*-1)+100;
    fill(colour, 100, shade, opacity);
    
    let diameter = i;
    circle(width/2, height/2, diameter); 
  } 
}
