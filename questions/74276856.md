I have a problem, my files have names including visible and hidden ones which I have managed to unhide through another code that are weighing the file down.
I want a code to go through names and delete only those which do not refer to the active workbook, as this issue comes up again and again for my team members.
I really appreciate if someone could help me.
Thanks
