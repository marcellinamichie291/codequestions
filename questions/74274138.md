# Is there a way to make drawing object in google sheet stays always in front (top)?

I have 2 drawing object in my google sheet, 1st drawing stays stationary and the 2nd moves when a value from a cell changes. My problem is when the row anchor changes to row 50 onwards the 2nd drawing moves behind the 1st drawing.


I tried searching if this could be done using macro but could not find any. Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.
