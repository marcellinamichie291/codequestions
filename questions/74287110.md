# Redshift Detect New Table in Shared Schema

I shared a schema from a Redshift cluster (instance) to another cluster (serverless). I have to create views in target cluster and perform access control on those views. When there is new table created in the source cluster, I have to manually create a new view in the target cluster.
Can I use a lambda function to automate createing of view upon new tables created (or existing tables modified) in the source cluster? Whats the event when new table created in a Redshift schema?
