# SVG: change color on hover without using a <style> tag

I need to export an SVG with some interaction on hover. In the specific change colors.
If I export the SVG and I use a <style> tag to add the hover animation and change color, this overrides other svgs on the page.
As my SVG is really complex, how can avoid this to happen and still have the hover animation?
 <svg>
    <style>
    #level_1:hover .st5 {fill: #BE82FA;}
    </style>
 </svg>
