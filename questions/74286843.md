# Does WordPress.com (WordPress Hosted) not wordpress.org(self-hosted) REST APIs supports Kerberos, NTLM, SAML authentication?

Does WordPress.com (SAAS Cloud-Hosted) support other authentications apart from the OAuth2 for accessing REST APIs?
Like SAML, Kerberos, NTLM, etc
On the official docs, it is mentioned as OAuth2.
https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/
However, I know there are some plugins like miniOrange we can install and have authentication like Basic Auth, API Key authentication, etc.
But is it possible on WordPress.com (SAAS Cloud-Hosted) too?
And also SAML, Kerberos, NTLM, too?
Need to know if SAML, Kerberos, NTLM authentication supports with Wordpress.com (SAAS Cloud-Hosted)
