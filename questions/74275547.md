# Debezium or JDBC skip tables without primary key

I have Debezium in a container, capturing all changes of PostgeSQL database records. In addition a have a confluent JDBC container to write all changes to another database.
The configured pk.mode on the sink is the following:
"pk.mode": "record_key",

But while there are tables in the source database without keys on the tables, sink connector is throwing the following message:
Caused by: org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.ConnectException: PK mode for table 'contex_str_dealer_branch_address' is RECORD_KEY, but record key schema is missing

Is there any way to skip those tables from any operation?
