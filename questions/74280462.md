# Making navbar sticky when I scroll past home section in react?

I am currently building my portfolio website and having trouble with some of the navbar customizations. I am trying to make the navbar sticky only when i scroll past the home section. The navbar should stay at the top, until I reach the about section (section 2), only then I want it to become sticky to the top of the page. I am having trouble finding what kind of event listener should be used for that.
I am also trying to find an event listener to tell me which section of the website I am currently on so the name of that section is showing in a different color. Anyone know how to go about this?
Thanks
