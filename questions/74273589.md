# Firebase dynamic link always open web version instead of Google play

App not installed. Clicking to firebase dynamic link lead to browser and open web content.
I am using this dynamic link: https://market.page.link/?link=https://market.kz/cabinet
I followed this doc: https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/create-manually
I tried specify afl and apn but it didnt help.
