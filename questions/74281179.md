# How to print Hash set implemented using Arrays?

import java.util.*;

class MyHashSet {
  private int[] hash= new int[1001];//Initializing Hash
  
  public MyHashSet(){
  Arrays.fill(hash,-1);//Filling array 
  }
  
  public void put(int key, int value){//inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key(index) already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
    hash[key]=value;
  }
  
  public int get(int key){// returns the value to which the specified key(index) is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
  return hash[key];//Note the -1 when filling the array.
  }
  
  public void remove(int key){// removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key
    hash[key]= -1;
   
  }

  

//Driver Code
public static void main(String[] args){
MyHashSet myHashSet = new MyHashSet();
myHashSet.put(1,1);
myHashSet.put(2,2);
myHashSet.get(1);
myHashSet.get(3);
myHashSet.put(2,1);
myHashSet.get(2);
myHashSet.remove(2);
myHashSet.get(2);`






}
}

Trying to print the HashSet but running into issues.
I tried the Arrays.toString to print but that doesn't work and yes I'm not exactly sure why althought from the other things I've seen when others implement a new int they include the elements as well and mines doesn't initially.
the intended out put I'm trying to get is :
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]
