# Conversion API - addToCart - event sended from browser with no name and data

when I send an AddToCart or Purchase event with Facebook conversion API in the event testing tool, it shows me that it is a custom event, sent using the browser. The name of this event is not displayed. After pressing an event, there is no more data.
I'm send events to https://graph.facebook.com/v15.0/[PIXEL_ID)/events and I'm using dynamic ads.
