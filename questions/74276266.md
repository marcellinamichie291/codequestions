# IdentityServer4 Could not load file or assembly Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens

I created an IdentityServer as described in https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstarts/1_client_credentials.html with .NET Core 3.1 on Windows 10. We use it in development, to mock some services. On most machines, it runs ok, but on two machines we get the error:
Could not load file or assembly Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens
I see, that Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens is referenced by Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols, which is referenced by Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect, which is referenced by IdentityServer4.

We uninstalled Nuget package IdentityServer4 and reinstalled it. That worked for about 10 minutes, but then the same problem occurred.
I found here in Stackoverflow the similar issue Could not load file or assembly Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens problem, but it is in Azure Functions, whereas we have it on our Windows 10 development machines with Visual Studio 2019 installed.
Does anybody have an idea how to fix this?
