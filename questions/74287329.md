# Electron app not working after upgrading Angular to v14

A couple of years ago I created an Angular-Electron project starting from the famous boilerplate from maximegris
I took back this project and started updating packages versions, including Angular (from 11 to 14)
Unfortunately, the application doesn't work anymore, as root component does not load and I receive this error on each javascript file:
Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.

The target in the tsconfig file is es5
