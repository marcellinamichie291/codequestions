# iOS crash: `com.apple.coreaudio.avfaudio: EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT): required condition is false: NULL != engine`

Our application uses speech recognition with .confirmation task hint. With the advent of iOS 16, the app starts crashing with com.apple.coreaudio.avfaudio: EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT): required condition is false: NULL != engine error. This mostly happened on the iPhone SE 2gen. Does anyone else have the same problem or have experience with a solution?
I already implement the audio engen stops, removing inpud node, all error handlers, put recognition request and recognition task in properties and set them to nil with audio engen stop. But the application continues to crash.
