# Could android:scaleType="fitXY" be causing Error: inflating class ImageView?

I have seen in the Firebase Crashlytics dashboard that there is an user that had crashes in some of the app's activities in the OnCreate() method. I have seen that it is an error of the xml as the error is this one and it is related with the ImageView component:

Fatal Exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity
ComponentInfo: android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line
#24: Binary XML file line #24: Error inflating class ImageView

I have seen that the layouts of the activities that are causing these crashes have in common that in the ImageView there is an attribute that is

android:scaleType="fitXY"

<ImageView
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                android:layout_weight="0.4"
                android:background="@drawable/img"
                android:scaleType="fitXY" />

So my question is, could that scaleType="fitXY" be causing all these crashes? Is it bad behaviour to use scaleType attribute in ImageViews then?
Thanks for the possible help
