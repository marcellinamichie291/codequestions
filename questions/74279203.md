# VBA Extract from Oracle

I need to extract from a dataset in Oracle, specifically using Toad for Oracle. The following code is working but it produces a list of 10 examples of the 1 result. How do I ensure the list produces 10 examples of different variables?
Sub ConnectToOracle()

    Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
    Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim mtxData As Variant
    
    Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
    Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
    
    cn.Open ( _
    "User ID = USERID" & _
    ";Password = PASSWORD" & _
    ";Data Source = DATASOURCE" & _
    ";Provider = OraOLEDB.Oracle")
    
    rs.CursorType = adOpenForwardOnly
    rs.Open ("select distinct var from dataset where rownum <= 10"), cn
    
    mtxData = rs.GetRows
    
End Sub



I have followed an initial template of code from YouTube and happy to use something else if better but I need clarification of how it should work.
