# Can someone explain what this piece of code is doing because i am lost. where did user come from and the required rights. I need concrete explanation

const verifyCallback = (req, resolve, reject, requiredRights) => async (err, user, info) => {
  if (err || info || !user) {
    return reject(new ApiError(httpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED, 'Please authenticate'));
  }
  req.user = user;

  if (requiredRights.length) {
    const userRights = roleRights.get(user.role);
    const hasRequiredRights = requiredRights.every((requiredRight) => userRights.includes(requiredRight));
    if (!hasRequiredRights && req.params.userId !== user.id) {
      return reject(new ApiError(httpStatus.FORBIDDEN, 'Forbidden'));
    }
  }

  resolve();
};

I want to understand what this piece of code is really trying to achieve
