I'm developing a little program in JavaFX.
My Problem is that I have BorderPane, and I want its Background formatted back to an Image.
I know the way from Image to Background.
I addition I can't use BorderPane.snapshot(null,null);
Thanks for help in advanced!
        
BorderPane bp2 = new BorderPane();


Image bp2Back = bp2.getBackground();
