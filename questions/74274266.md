# Bulk change project descriptions / add text to all empty descriptions

I want to add a text to all empty wordpress project desctripions at once, otherwise I will have to change all descriptions manually. So is there a plugin? or a different way to change all EMPTY desctripions at once?

I have tried searching for plugins, searching online/youtube and all sorts of forums.
And it would be nice if theres a way to make a desc template for future projects.
