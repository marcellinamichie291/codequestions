# I have to list first and last name of staff and I think I need to join three different tables

List the first and last name of all female staff that have made an appointment for a customer from Canberra for mechanical repair work
I think these are the three tables I need to join
Customer(customerNumber(PK), firstName, lastName, streetNumber, streetName, suburb, postcode, city, state, gender, workRequired, customerRego(FK))
RepairAppointment(repairAppNumber(PK), customernumber(FK), branchNumber(FK), time/date, staffNumber(FK))
Staff(staffNumber(PK), firstName, lastName, position, gender, DOB, salary, sectionNumber(FK), intPhone, branchNumber(FK))
SELECT Staff.firstName, Staff.lastName, Count(*) AS CountOfStaff
FROM Staff
INNER JOIN RepairAppointment ON Staff.staffNumber = RepairAppointment.staffNumber
WHERE (((Staff.gender)="f"))
GROUP BY Staff.staffNumber, Staff.firstName, Staff.lastName
This is what I have so far but it doesn't filter if the customer was from city='Canberra'
I'm so lost, help!
