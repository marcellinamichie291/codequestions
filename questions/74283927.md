# What to do with mysqli problems? Errors like mysqli_fetch_array(): Argument #1 must be of type mysqli_result and such

In my local/development environment, the MySQLi query is performing OK. However, when I upload it on my web host environment, I get this error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function bind_param() on a non-object in...

Here is the code:
global $mysqli;
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT id, description FROM tbl_page_answer_category WHERE cur_own_id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param('i', $cur_id);
$stmt->execute();
$stmt->bind_result($uid, $desc);

To check my query, I tried to execute the query via control panel phpMyAdmin and the result is OK.
