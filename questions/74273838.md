# git - easy way to merge 3 trees without touching index or working tree

I have a rather devilish idea in my head that requires me to run different merge operations where I do not want to touch the index nor the working tree. I know about git merge-tree that I think used to do what I am requesting but it has been obsoleted (at least the possibility of providing the 3 trees and getting the resulting tree id as output). Are there other current ways to do it?
Just to be clear:

I do not want to mess up with histories.
I want to provide the base tree and the 2 tip trees.
And last but not least, I do not want to mess up with the index nor the working tree.

All I need as output is the resulting tree id if merge succeeds.... if there are conflicts it's ok that I get nothing.
