I posted this question about using AttributedString with TextEditor because I wanted to format my strings with things like different colors and other attributes.
The challenge is that TextEditor does not take in AttributedString types and so I cannot use it as my multiline text input field after I take in a string and format it to my liking for specific ranges. This is why using TextEditor as mentioned How to create a multiline TextField in SwiftUi ? like the notes app? does not work for me.
How can we create a multiline text input field that simulates TextEditor but allows for AttributedString? (MacOS)
Attempting to use TextEditor with AttributedString throws an error, and concatenating Text views seems like not a good path to go down with large amounts of text.
