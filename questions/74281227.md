# "Connection error SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused"

To introduce my concern, I use the directory /var/www/htmlyour text to publish websites locally, except that I have a problem that prevents me from programming when I put my files in this directory index.php with the other files used for the index.php (to make the link between PhpMyAdmin and MySql) I open the local ip address on the web of my server (inex.php) I get "Connection error SQLSTATE[HY000] [ 2002] Connection refused"
I do not know what to do !
I tried to change the rights in the whole directory with several commands
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html sudo chown -R 755 /var/www/html and sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
