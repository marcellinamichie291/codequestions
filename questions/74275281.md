# WSL2 issues with Docker on Windows 10 after device sleeps

I recently installed Docker Desktop for a project and started getting issues with WSL2. Initially, everything works fine. I am able to both use the Docker Desktop interface and execute docker commands in the WSL2 context. But, after I leave my laptop to sleep on itself (I lock the screen and leave for lunch, for example), WSL2 is busted when I come back. Docker commands from the VSCode terminal are now not working, and I can't open a WSL tab from the Windows terminal. This is the error:
process exited with code 4294967295 (0xffffffff)

Most solutions I found online are related to disabling something called "Acrylic DNS", which I either don't use, or am unable to find. I am, however, certain that I haven't installed it manually.
Some extra info:
WSL2 Distro: Ubuntu 20.04
Docker Desktop Version: 4.13.1
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise
OS Version: 22H2
OS Build: 19045.2193
