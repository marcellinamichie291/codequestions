# Why does pow works here

From what i know the function pow works only with double and returns double
but in this programm everything works fine and its all in int.
i just want to understand like so why even though it only works with double here it works with ints
void squre_OF_3_digit_number()
{
    int num;//123
    do
    {
        printf("please enter a 3 digit number--> ");
        scanf_s("%d",&num);
    } while (num>999 || num<100);
    int n0 = pow((num%10),2);
    int n1 = pow(((num%100)/10),2);
    int n2 = pow((num/100),2);
    printf(" %d+%d+%d=%d ",n0,n1,n2,n0+n1+n2);
    
}`
