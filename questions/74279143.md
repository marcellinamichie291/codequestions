# Cytoscape.js issue with animations - changes lost between two steps

I've been assessing how to use animation with cytoscape.js
Reusing the exemple in the tutorial:

cy.nodes()   .animate({
style: { 'background-color': 'blue' }
}, {
duration: 1000
})
.delay( 1000 )
.animate({
style: { 'background-color': 'yellow' }   }) ;

it occurs that I've a transition from "white", my initial color, to "blue".
Then, there is a new transition to "yellow", but not starting from "blue" but from the initial color, "white".
At the end of the animation, the graph is changed, and the background color is "yellow", and not "white" anymore.
So I would like to understand why, in the second transition, the initial color is set up back to white before to transition to blue.
Did someone faced the same issue and could explain the reason of such a behavior?
Thanks in advance.
