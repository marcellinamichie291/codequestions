# When I use geom data in fastapi with GeoAlchemy, there is no return

I have the 'GPolygon.geom' column.
result= db.query(functions.ST_AsGeoJSON(GPolygon.geom)).all()
The query fastAPI /docs also return like this:
[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]
whereas when I print the result variable to the console it returns true like this:
[('555cc03c56861c0c00a0bd9b', 32, '{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[28.9766479360001,41.061765108],[28.977028256,41.0615969520001],[28.977158339,41.0615981070001],[28.9771687300001,4 ...

Why am I not getting the correct return from the api even though my query is running?
i tried this: result= db.query(functions.ST_AsGeoJSON(GPolygon.geom)).all()
I expect this from http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to return:
