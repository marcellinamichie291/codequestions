I am trying to build a text based dungeoneering game with Python and figured to use oop. I've created a few modules for clear seperation of concern. I want to create a "battle loop" where I can keep track of the character and enemy stats. To do this I want to inherit all the properties and and functions of the classes I get this error from trying to use multiple inheritence. Not sure why.
Error
line 3, in <module>
    class Battle(Character,Enemy):
TypeError: module() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)

Events
import Character,Enemy

class Battle(Character,Enemy):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.player = Character
        self.oppenent = Enemy

battle = Battle("Wes")
print(battle.player.Health)


Characters
class Person:

    def __init__(self,name):
        # strength -> attack, constituion -> defense
        self.strength = 3
        self.constitution = 2
        self.health = 50
        self.mana = 20
        self.exp = 0
        self.name = name
        self.level = 1

Enemy
class Goblin:
    
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.strength = 3
        self.constitution = 2
        self.health = 50
        self.mana = 20
        self.exp = 0
        self.name = name
        self.level = 1

I tried
class Battle(Character,Enemy):

    def __init__(self,Character,Enemy):
        super().__init__()
        self.player = Character
        self.oppenent = Enemy

and
class Battle(Character,Enemy):

    def __init__(self,user,enemy):
        super().__init__()
        self.player = Character
        self.oppenent = Enemy

I expected to print out the health, and instead there is an error in the paramaters being passed?
