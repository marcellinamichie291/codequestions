# How to pass props of TouchableOpacity to parent component in react native

I have made a child component which has TouchableOpacity, I want to pass props of TouchableOpacity like disabled to parent component
child component:
import React from 'react';
import {TouchableOpacity, TouchableOpacityProps} from 'react-native';

export interface ComponentProps {
    touchProps?: TouchableOpacityProps;
}

const ListComponent = (props: ComponentProps) => {
    const touchProps = props.touchProps || {};

    return (
        <TouchableOpacity
            {...touchProps}>
        {/* other things */}
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
};

Here I have declared touchProps, I want to use this in parent component
parent component:
<ListComponent 
    touchProps={disabled={true}}
/>

I am getting error:
Type '{ true: any; }' has no properties in common with type 'TouchableOpacityProps'.
I am not able to find what I am doing wrong.
