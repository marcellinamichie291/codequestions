# How to detect WKWebView and Chromium WebView?

I'm using ReactJS and I want to detect if the users are using WKWebView or Chromium WebView to view my website accross all the browsers.
I'm thinking about detecting the User Agent String if it includes phrases like WKWebView or Chrome/{version_number} and wv according to Chrome's documentation.
But I don't know if this works because there isn't any example on the internet of WKWebView.
I tried using 'is-ua-webview' npm package but it doesn't work in my case.
