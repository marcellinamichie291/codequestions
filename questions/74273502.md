I have simple data but complex calculation.

Requirement is to calculate the total fee for specific zone (Local/Regional/National) with current level (Premium/Advanced/Standard/Basic) for total weight of item ordered in particular date range.
Example: If someone ordered an item weighing 4.5 kg in total on 23-04-2022 which is to be delivered at national level and level is advanced, total fee will be - 60(0-500gm) +25 (500-1kg) + 33*4 (each kg upto 5 kg) = $ 217.
New values of fees will be there as per dates ranges. Size bands can also vary based upon dates. Levels & zones are constant. Fees to be calculated based on ordered date. Cannot use VBA. Using Online excel. Formula will be more suitable.
Expecting a formula based solution
