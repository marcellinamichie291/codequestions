# typescript proto files not generating

I am able to generate JS and golang protobuf files, but not typescript. I keep getting an error that reads.
protoc-gen-ts: program not found or is not executable

Oddly, the JS files generated do not did not generate a client server. However, I would rather use typescript in combination with vue.js. As for the backend server I am using GO, and it did generate the server connection code. Hopefully once the typescript generation works the code to create the client server will be generated.
Question:
What is wrong with my proto command? The plugin is there and it appears to be inline with the docs.
Advice?
