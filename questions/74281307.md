# VHDL implementation to fpga

I want to make the implementation of a 0 to 99 numbers shown in the picture but I dont know how to make the in I value match with the DEC or UNI out value. 
This is my code: 
I need to make the M in value with the switches of the fpga 6 downto 0 and show a number between 0 to 99 in the 2 displays, but I dont know how to make the implementation
