# Pandas - Processing DF with multiple identifier into a combined column

I have below DF that i wanted to process to be like the sample below. Im having a hard time due to the identifier is sharing the column where what site they are located. the column location is also not fix as there are certain times where the "Land" has 30days whereas the "Water" only has 5 days
Thank you for helping me
Sample DF:
df = pd.DataFrame({'Unnamed: 0': ['Site',"A", "B","C"],
               'Unnamed: 1': ['Identifier 1',"Land", "Land","Land"],
               'Unnamed: 2': ['Day 1',1, 2,3],
               'Unnamed: 3': ['Day 2',4, 5,6],
               'Unnamed: 4': ['Day 3',7, 8,9],
               'Unnamed: 5': ['Day 4',10, 11,12],
               'Unnamed: 6': ['Identifier 2',"Water", "Water","Water"],
               'Unnamed: 7': ['Day 1',13, 14,15],
               'Unnamed: 8': ['Day 2',16, 17,18],
               'Unnamed: 9': ['Day 3',19, 20,21],
               'Unnamed: 10': ['Day 4',22, 23,24],
               })

Output file:


Site    Identifier 1    Day 1   Day 2   Day 3   Day 4
A   Land    1   4   7   10
B   Land    2   5   8   11
C   Land    3   6   9   12
A   Water   13  16  19  22
B   Water   14  17  20  23
C   Water   15  18  21  24
