# BlippAR Web AR SDK Refused to Create a Worker

i created project using BlippAR Web AR SDK to show simple 3D, for the first step, i think i'll use the template that BlippAR provided but change the *.glb only, but when i try to deploy to my hosting (cpanel), it shown this error
Refused to create a worker from 'blob:https://mywebsite.com/a043c781-5901-4d48-8726-bd3cf6bf37b3' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src * data: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'". Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback. Note that '*' matches only URLs with network schemes ('http', 'https', 'ws', 'wss'), or URLs whose scheme matches self's scheme. The scheme 'blob:' must be added explicitly.
Here's the code that i used for this project

      <a-entity webar-stage>
        <a-entity
          gltf-model="#chicken"
          id="chicken_1"
          rotation="0 0 0"
          position="0 0 0"
          scale="0.25 0.25 0.25"
          webar-loadmonitor="elType: glb"
        ></a-entity>
      </a-entity>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>

I'm pretty sure that my code is 100% correct. All the dependencies file, such as WebAR SDK, has been put in the right directory and called correctly from the script. So I guess the problem is from the SSL, so I tried to remove the SSL from my Cpanel the access now is from http://, but it's still not working, so I turned on the SSL back.
My expected result is the AR is working properly and can be accessed from my phone (safari/chrome)
