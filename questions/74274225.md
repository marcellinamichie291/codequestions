# child component is not displaying in blazor server

I am using bootstrap tab for the first active tab. I am using child component under tab content.
When I open the web page for the 1st time, content inside the child component is loaded (it can be seen in inspect window) but it is not displaying on the page. When I click on the 2nd bootstrap tab and come back to the 1st tab, child component is displaying.
The issue is when I open the page 1st time, I am not able to see the child component of active tab.
if I open the page, the child content should be displaying.
