# Increase Output Resolution of Python cProfile (More Resolution in Output Required)

I am profiling a simple Python function such as
def prof_func():
    x = 100
    y = 100
    a = np.random.rand(x,y)
    c = signal.convolve2d(a, a, boundary='symm', mode='same')

using cProfile but the times I get out only have a resolution of three decimal places.
How can I have cProfile print a greater number of decimal places so I can see how long the a = np.random.rand(x,y)  line takes. Currently cProfile tells me that it takes 0.000s.
I had hoped that there would be an easy way to increase the resolution of the cProfile output but I have checked the documentation and not found one: https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html
