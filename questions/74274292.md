# Can we use GIT with AEM

I am new to AEM and using an AEM author instance in standalone mode. I understand that the sites etc. that we create using AEM and the assets that we add are stored locally in the JCR. Can git be used with any project which is stored locally in JCR for version controlling, pushing to GitHub to share with others etc.,?
