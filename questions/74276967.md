# Hints about interacting with an IOCTL on a good way?

im trying to interact with a Device with some IOCTLs exposed, im new on reverse engineering and im having some troubles to probe my exploits attempts. Anyone knows how to do it (C/python/whatever) on a good way or can give me any hints?
Expecting something like a family of functions, library or some examples.
