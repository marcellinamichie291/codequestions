# Multiple distinct with aliases in select statement in mysql

I've one mySql query with 9-10 Joins.
I've added select statements for getting values, due to multiple joins I'm getting repeated data for every value. I've tried to add distinct with alias, but I'm able to add distinct with alias only for one field only, for more fields it is giving error.
Expected Result :
I need to add distinct with alias for multiple fields in select statement in mySql.
Can anyone tell me how we can do it, any example.
P.S. Not able to share mySql query here because fields/records are private and I'm not authorised to share.
Tried multiple distinct with alias in single select but not working.
Found one sol in which it was mentioned we can use sub queries for this, but not sure whether it will work or not.
