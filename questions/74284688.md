# How to decode MongoDB bindata type to UUID string in SQL Server

I am migrating data from MongoDB to SQL server using an ETL tool (SSIS).
There are bindata type 0 fields that are brought across as $binary and $type pairs. I want to know how I can decode this on SQL server side to represent it as a UUID string.
For example.
In MongoDB:
BinData(0, '+d5gI8MYTUCgoSXnkERZLA==')

Desired output in SQL Server:
f9de6023-c318-4d40-a0a1-25e79044592c
