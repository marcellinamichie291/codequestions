# SQL group by if columnA is equal to columnB

I have the following SQL table:
+-------------+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
| flow_number | src_ip         | dst_ip         | date                |
+-------------+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
|           1 | 1.1.1.1.1      | 192.168.2.218  | 2022-11-01 16:00:10 |
|           1 | 192.168.2.218  | 1.1.1.1        | 2022-11-01 16:00:10 |

I would like to be able to combine both to a single record in case src_ip == dst_ip. So would like to get the following result:
+-------------+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
| flow_number | src_ip         | dst_ip         | date                |
+-------------+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
|           2 | 1.1.1.1        | 192.168.2.218  | 2022-11-01 16:00:10 |

Tried with MD5 and CONCAT few options. Tried to add two new columns (hashes) of src_ip+dst_ip and dst_ip+src_ip. But still can not group based on a different columns.
How to solve this problem ?
Thanks,
