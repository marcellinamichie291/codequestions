# How to access Ory_Kratos_session cookie in laravel

`I want to get json data from one API in laravel. If access the api normally in browser in it won't show any data until I log in to one purticular portal which adds ory_kratos_session cookies. I will be able see data only till I am logged in to that particular portal. Now I want to access the data through that API in laravel but it is showing me 401 Unauthorized error. I have one more api which adds ory_kratos cookies but don't know how to do it.
I tried to use the second api which adds ory kratos and gave redirection to the url where I want the data to be loaded but still it's not working.`
