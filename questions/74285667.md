# Curl with json and file

I want to send a file along with json data to my end point, something like this:
curl --location --request POST 'abc.com/upload'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer '
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data-raw '{
"user": {"email":"abx@xyz.com"},
"options": {"process":"order_lines","selection":"price","tolerance":"loose","target":"transport_orders"},
"import-file": "/path/to/file.csv"
}'

I want to achieve something like this, how can I do this?
