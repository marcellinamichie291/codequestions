# Acknowledgement bit setting in CAN lower level

As we know, in CAN Acknowledgement bit is set when receiver receives the transmitted data correctly.
Can you please explain how this bit is set and who monitors and sets at CAN lower level ?
I am trying to test the below test case :
In which tester is sending high priority frames until maximum timeout for Ar and after this maximum timeout i am getting positive response but ideally we should get no response.
So i am trying to understand who sets the bit for Acknowledgement as I am getting positive response for my test case.
