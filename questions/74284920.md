# Confusion in epsilon greedy policy

I am trying to understand epsilon greedy policy but I am facing the following doubt.
The epsilon greedy policy is such that we select the action according to the following rule:
argmax Q(s,a) with probability 1-epsilon
random otherwise

where Q(s,a) is basically a matrix of size depending on s and a. For time being let s = 3 and a = 3. Thus assuming Q(s,a) as some 3 x 3 matrix. For e.g., Q(s,a) = [2 1 7; 4 3 5; 9 8 6]
Then my query is how the maximum action from the matrix is obtained?
Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.
