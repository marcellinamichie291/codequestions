# Creating an associative array to query one SQL in PHP to get several results

I am new to PHP and would appreciate any assistance in creating an associative array to query a table using SQL.
I want to use one select statement to get multiple results depending on the 'WHERE' key.
$a = $DB->getOne("SELECT DEF_VAL FROM JDEFAULTS WHERE DEF_KEY = :0", array('ip'));

$stmt1 = $DB->getOne("SELECT DEF_VAL FROM JDEFAULTS WHERE DEF_KEY = :0", array('ftpUserid'));

$c = $DB->getOne("SELECT DEF_VAL FROM JDEFAULTS WHERE DEF_KEY = :0", array('ftpPasswd'));

These codes return different values (as expected). I want to merge all of these into one line of SQL and get the values in a list depending on the DEF_KEY value.
