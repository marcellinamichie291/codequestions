# Program that calculates subtotal of prices is not functioning properly

This code I have to write should display the subtotal, number of items, sales tax, and total cost
When I run it, the program calculates the prices entered wrong, and only prompts me 2 times for a price, when it should prompt me until I tell it to stop.
This program uses a while loop and sentinel to proccess the total
of item costs purchased online. There is also a tax rate of 6.25%
in the calculation.
SENTINEL = 0
TAXRATE = 0.0625
numItems = 0
subTotal = 0

print("""/
This program will prompt you for the items you purchased online
until you enter the sentinel value of 0 to stop the process. The
program will create a running total of the items.\n\n\n""")

itemCost = float(input("Enter the price of the item(0 to stop):"))


while itemCost != SENTINEL:
    if itemCost < 0:
        print(f'this price is illegal!')
    else:
        numItems+=1
        subTotal+=itemCost
    itemCost = float(input("Enter the price of the item(0 to stop):"))

    if numItems > 0:
        salesTax = subTotal * TAXRATE
        totalCost = subTotal + salesTax
        print(f'The number of items purchased is {numItems}')
        print(f'The sub total is {subTotal:.2f}')
        print(f'The sales tax is {salesTax:.2f}')
        print(f'The total cost is {totalCost:.2f}')
    else:
        print(f'You need to purchase items!')

I expected this program to prompt infinitley until you put in the sentinel number, but it only prompts twice. It also thinks that numItems always equals 1, when it shouldnt. it also calculates everything wrong.
