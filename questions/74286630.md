# Attempting to make a binding to cycle SwitchActors with a BP

So I'm attempting to make a Key Binding that will cycle through switch actors in a level whenever I hit "P" on the keyboard, and I realize I've gone wrong somewhere...
I created the binding in Project Settings > Input and I can pull the binding onto what I assume is the level blueprint that I accessed from Window > Level > Persistent Level > Open Blue Print
Can anyone tell me why this isn't functioning? Am I confused about that being the Level Blue Print? Do bindings like that need to be elsewhere? Did I misunderstand how the function would need to work?
