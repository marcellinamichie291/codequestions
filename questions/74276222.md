# R, arrow: How to read .fwf format in R using arrow

I have a data that is stored in several fixed width files (perhaps not fitting memory). It would be great to be able to read that using arrow.
p <- 'path_to_my_files'
# p contains: a.txt, b.txt, c.txt,.... all fwf
dic <- fread('fwf_dictionary.csv') # contains two columns varname and lenght indicating the variables (and position) in the fwf file

Is there a read_fwf_arrow(path,dic) function?  I imagine that a combination of read_delim_arrow (with a never occurring delimiter) with dplyr parsing for each column would be able to do the job, but I don't know how to loop through the variables in dic to extract each variable.
read_fwf_arrow <- function(path,dic){
    p %>% read_delimn_arrow(delim='#') %>% 
    loop_extracting_cols_that_can_run_on_arrow
}
