# Variable from flask app not showing in HTML

I have a problem that is very frustrating. I have a variable named nametext and it is not showing in the final render of my webapp. I hope you know why.
Python/flask code
`
def home():
    return render_template('home.html', nametest='Daan')


html code
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}


    <br/>
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1>Welcome to {{ nametest }} the PetriPlanets Universe</h1>
        <p class="lead">Welcome Home</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
     </div>

{% endblock %}

`

As you see the 'Daan' string is not part of the render
