# Sending email where the 'from address' has multiple emails

I am sending emails using javax mail APIs in a batch process. Due to an error in configuration the 'from' address got set to multiple comma separated email addresses.
The code snippet is like the following:
MimeMessage msg = new MimeMessage (mailSession);
...
msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress(from));

I did not get exceptions but I am not sure if the emails were sent correctly; and if they were sent whether they would end up in recipient's spam.
