# How can I add formatting punctuation to user input as they type text using Bash's "read" utility prompt?

I have the following lines to prompt a user to enter a date/time that I use further down in my script:
printf "Please insert start of time window in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS: \n"
read startDatetime

Is there a way I can have the "read" prompt insert in the dashes for the date, the space between the date and time, and the colons for the time dynamically as a user types? I know this is possible using JavaScript on the web, but I am specifically looking for a command line version of that functionality.
I searched the web for an answer to this and cannot find one. I see an option for delimiter in the read Man Page but cannot see how it would achieve what I am trying to do.
