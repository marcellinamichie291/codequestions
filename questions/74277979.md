# Using PySpark to read in datalake table and can't parse timestamp column in Synapse Analytics

I can read in the datalake table and print schema but if I try and display data I get the following error. I am working within Synapse Analytics using a PySpark Notebook and Apache Spark Pool.
See error message:
You may get a different result due to the upgrading of Spark 3.0: Fail to parse '10/27/2022 1:14:31 PM' in the new parser.
You can set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy to LEGACY to restore the behavior before Spark 3.0, or set to CORRECTED and treat it as an invalid datetime string.
I've tried converting using the following code
df = df.withColumn("SinkCreatedOn",to_date(col("SinkCreatedOn"),"M/dd/yyyy h:m:s"))
df = df.withColumn("SinkModifiedOn",to_date(col("SinkModifiedOn"),"M/dd/yyyy h:m:s"))

I've also tried converting the suspect columns to StringType() or DateType() but no luck.
Any help appreciated
Thank you
