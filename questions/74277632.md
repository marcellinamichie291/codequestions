# UMBRACO 10 HTTP Error 500.30 - ASP.NET Core app failed to start

I am trying to deploy my Website with umbraco 10, I always get the following error:
HTTP Error 500.30 - ASP.NET Core app failed to start
The website works correctly locally, however when deploying the app I get the same error...
Details:

DB SQL Server
Azure WebApp .Net6

What i have tried

I have followed the instructions: https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Fundamentals/Setup/Server-Setup/azure-web-apps

I have created a project from scratch, thinking that the problem was some package, but still the same error.
