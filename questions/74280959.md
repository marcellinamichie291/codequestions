# "AttributeError: unexpected attribute 'plot_width' to figure, similar attributes are outer_width, width or min_width " with pandas_bokeh

I am trying to use pandas_bokeh to create a line graph with a pandas dataframe I call bucketed_df
import pandas_bokeh
pandas_bokeh.output_notebook()

bucketed_df.plot_bokeh(kind='line')

for some reason I get the error
AttributeError: unexpected attribute 'plot_width' to figure, similar attributes are outer_width, width or min_width

Im not sure what this is or how toi fix it. I am using python 3.9 and jupyter notebooks
I have a matplotlib linegraph in a cell above it. I am thinking there could be some issue with that.
Also if anyone knows any interactive graphs that are better I am open to switching to a different library.
