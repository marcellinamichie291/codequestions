# Odoo 15 Find tax_ids Inside the account.move.line (Invoice) Model

Good day, hope everything's well.
I'm trying to find the value of tax_ids (Many2many field) inside the account.move.line model but i can't seems to find anything. I already access the psql of the database but i cant find tax_ids too.
I accessed that account.move.line model with ORM like this :
    def _post(self, soft=True):
        for move in self:
            ....
            account_move_line = self.env['account.move.line'].search([('id', '=', int(move.id))])
            print(account_move_line.tax_ids) #this find nothing

could someone please elaborate how is it possible to access id of the tax that applied to, in this case, an invoice line record?
Edit : Sometimes this ORM fetching the ID and sometimes it doesn't. But most likely it's not fetching.
