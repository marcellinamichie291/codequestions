# ORACLE PL/SQL : How to pass an exception into a procedure

Is there a way to pass exception into a procedure to call "raise" after doing some actions to process exception. So that the outer code block will get the exact exception that was raised
Something like this:
begin
    ...
exception
    when others then
        error_handler( err );
end;

procedure error_handler ( err ) is
begin
    /*
        here some code to handle and log the exception...
    */

    raise err;
end;

Or the only way is to pass SQLCODE and SQLERRM into the procedure and later call raise_application_error( SQLCODE, SQLERRM )?
