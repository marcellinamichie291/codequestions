# How to make SonarQube dashboard display branch coverage and function coverage?

I use Jacoco as the coverage tool and send the test report to SonarQube. But in SonarQube dashboard, there are only line coverage and condition coverage.
How to make the SonarQube displays branch coverage and function coverage?
Any help is appreciated.
