# How to compile files in subdirectories with code runner extension in VS Code?

I'm using VS Code with "Code Runner" extension to compile & run my C++ code, and it works, until I need to build project with subdirectories. I.e. if I have 3 files in project like this:

where lib.cpp file contains class Box (with constructor and one method), everything works fine if I'm using class Box in main.cpp.
However, if lib.cpp and lib.h is in subdirectory:

compiler returns error message with
undefined reference to 'Box::Box(int)'
undefined reference to 'Box::get_size()'
My current setting.json file looks like
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default High Contrast",
    "code-runner.runInTerminal": true,
    "terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning": false,
    "window.restoreFullscreen": true,
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "cpp": "cd $dir && g++ -o $fileNameWithoutExt *.cpp && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt"
    }
}

I guess, I have to change 7-th line, but how exactly?
I tried to google this problem, but I didn't find anything about this problem.
