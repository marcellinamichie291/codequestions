# Count all acf repeater fields belonging to the specific post type

I am currently trying to count all ACF repeater fields that belong to the determined post type.
Post type: investors
ACF Repeater Field: suchprofile
Somehow I do not get any further. Or rather I get a value of 0.
Is this because a loop is missing? I just want to count everything. For example, if a 20 investors (post type) each have 20 suchprofil (acf reapeater field) I want to output 400.
`function suchprofile_shortcode( $atts ) {
$rows = get_sub_field('suchprofil');
if( have_rows('suchprofil') );
$count = count($rows);
echo $count;

}
add_shortcode( 'suchprofile', 'suchprofile_shortcode');
`
Does anyone have an idea. Tried various posts and solutions.
Best thanks
Andy
