# How to automate Visual Studio Code startup?

I need to setup my development environment multiple times a day, I want to automate the process to a one-click solution.
The goal is to having a main script which opens up two VS Code instances, one for the frontend, one for the backend project.
The steps should be the following:
- open VS Code
- open Backend Project (located at e.g.: C:/myCompany/backend)
- run git pull
- open terminal
- run docker-compose up
- open split terminal
- run npm run start:dev
- open another vscode
- open terminal
- git pull
- open terminal
- run npm run start:dev

I am running windows, I can create very basic ps1 files, I know you can use terminal and run 'code' command to start an instance of VS Code. After that I don't find information what to do next.
I know there some kind of scripts you can run in Vs Code too, but I cannot put it all together.
