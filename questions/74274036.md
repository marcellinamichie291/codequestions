J'utilise le nugget "RestSharp" pour envoier une requête à l'API de Spotify.
Mon problème est que l'uri est invalide and il faut que je définisse une position  bien que je l'ai faite
The purpose of my request is that she can play the music on a device connected to spotify
Here is the link : https://developer.spotify.com/console/put-play/
and here is my code :
var client = new RestClient("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play?device_id=" + "ac148500ceb4ec3e34ee31acc93f7c6cbfa7803a");
            var request = new RestRequest("https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play?device_id=" + "ac148500ceb4ec3e34ee31acc93f7c6cbfa7803a", Method.Put);

            request.AddHeader("Accept", "application/json");
            request.AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
            request.AddHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken);

            request.AddJsonBody(
                new
                {
                    context_uri = "spotify:playlist:" + "5a478a871ddd4a0d",
                    offset = new Position("position", 2),
                    position_ms = 0
                });

            RestResponse response = client.Execute(request);

Thanks for your help
I tried to modify the query several times but here is the one I came closest to.
