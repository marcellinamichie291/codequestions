# Is there any Middleware equivalent in Recoil?

I was wondering if anyone could point me out to some examples of using useRecoilCallback ( or anything in replacement to using a middleware in redux).
Basically I have :
Component_1
-> SubComponent_11
-> SubComponent_12
-> SubSubComponent_121

Component_2
-> SubComponent_21
-> SubComponent_22
-> SubComponent_23
-> SubSubComponent_231
When I click a button which triggers a change in state in Component_1 > Subcomponent_12 > SubSubComponent_121
I want that state to be updated in a different component substructure
i.e.
Component_2 > Subcomponent_23 > SubSubComponent_231
How can I use middleware in recoil to do the above?
I am very new to Recoil, so I don't have much clue on this. It would be great if someone can point me out if useRecoilCallback can be used here? Or how would you show a workaround
