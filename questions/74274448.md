# Nuxt3 Robots.txt - @nuxtjs/robots not generating robots.txt file

I'm building a Nuxt 3 project. I need my build to generate a robots.txt file, just like this package states it does -> https://github.com/nuxt-community/robots-module
After running "nuxt build" and/or "nuxt generate", the robots.txt does not appear in the output or public folders as I'd expect.
I'm definitely missing something and likely being an idiot here.. Does anyone know what I'm missing? Here's my code:
package.json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@nuxtjs/robots": "^2.5.0", 
    }

nuxt.config.ts
 target: "static",
  runtimeConfig: {
    NUXT_STORYBLOK_PRODUCTION_KEY: process.env.NUXT_STORYBLOK_PRODUCTION_KEY,
    public: {
      CDN: process.env.CDN,
      NUXT_STORYBLOK_PREVIEW_KEY: process.env.NUXT_STORYBLOK_PREVIEW_KEY,
      NUXT_DOMAIN_NAME: process.env.NUXT_DOMAIN_NAME,
    },
  },
  modules: [
    ...
    "@nuxtjs/robots",
  ],
  robots: {
    UserAgent: "*",
    Disallow: "",
  },
}
