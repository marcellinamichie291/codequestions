# Conditional slicing in a 2-dimensional array in R

I have a two-dimension array made up from latitude(dimension 1) and longitude(dimension 2) coordinates. The position of each pair of lat,long coordinates corresponds to a position in a 3-dimensional array of temperature data (Third dimension representing depth).
I would like to extract the positions of lat long coordinates such that the latitude is valued 60<lat<70 and -60<long<-50  so that I can relate them to the temperature array and extract temperature data for particular regions. I am new to R, and programming in general, so this has been quite the problem for me.
#Extracts latitude and longitude matrices into variables
nav_lat <- ncvar_get(nc,"nav_lat")
nav_long <- ncvar_get(nc,"nav_lon")

#Overlays lat and long matrices to create pairs
nav_latlong <- array(c(nav_lat,nav_long),dim=(c(1442,398,2)))

region <- filter(nav_latlong,between(60,70) & between(-60,-50))

Is this what you mean by a small reproducible example?:
library(tidyverse)

vector_1 <- c(5,9,3)
vector_2 <- c(10,11,12)
result <- array(c(vector_1,vector_2),dim=c(3,3,2))

region <- filter(result,between(result[,,1],5,10) & between(result[,,2],10,12))

SO here I would want to extract pairs where the first element is between 5 and 10, and the second element is between 10 and 12.
