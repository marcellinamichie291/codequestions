# Upgrade pip install on Win10 box

I'm trying to upgrade pip install to 22.3. I keep getting this error, "default to user install because normal sit-packages is not writeable."
I'm at the cmd prompt in win10 trying to install.
This came about because I'm trying to install pypdf2 and this won't install to python that's in my environment path. So I'm stumped.
Thanks for any help.
