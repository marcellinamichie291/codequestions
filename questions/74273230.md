# How to send a trace data to an OTLP gRPC endpoint?

Noob question here. I'm getting the data from AWS X-Ray and trying to send it to an endpoint of OTLP.
Sample Data:
{
    "id": "12345678901233456",
    "name": "asdfghjkl",
    "start_time": 1.666058486989E9,
    "trace_id": "1-adg346-dhagjkh348762834jah37846f",
    "end_time": 1.666058487934E9
}


Created a proto for AWS X-Ray segment document format
Marshaling the data to send it to the OTLP endpoint
Creating requests using http.NewRequestWithContext
Added a header of Content-Type: application/json

I'm still quite new to this and confused about how to do it properly. Since I'm a beginner in AWS, protobuf, and gRPC. It is still unable to send the data to the OTLP receiver for it to be processed.
Is there something wrong with how I'm doing it? Can someone give me some advice or help me to do it properly? Is there a format that I need to follow? How the data be sent should look?
