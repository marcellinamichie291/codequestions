# Reporting Errors In Spring Boot Startup

When my application.yml does not match the database schema properly in my springboot application it will fail to start with a very verbose exception trace.
This trace is very difficult for a user to parse, even if I log the failure reason, it will be lost in a barrage of logs.
Worse yet, if the user launcher the program from a shortcut it will disappear and they will need to dig up the log or run it from the command line.
I would like to popup a message box right when I encounter the problem.
I tried adding a JOptionPane.showMessageDialog but this throws a  java.awt.HeadlessException.
Is there a more canonical way to provide user feedback when a spring boot application fails to start?
