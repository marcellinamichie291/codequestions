# get the path of the executed file once "compiled" with pyinstaller

I know there are a lot of answers on this subject, but no one works once you compile a script in an executable.
In my python script, I create a file within the same directory of the script.
to get the path of the current dir I use pathlib
basepath = Path(__file__).parent
filename='myfile'
filepath=os.path.join(basepath, filename)

if I print the directory I get the file wrote in the good directory and everything works fine within python
(i.e desktop/myname/myscriptdir/myfile)
but once I "compile" with pyinstaller with --onefile, if I launch the executable, the directory will be
like
/var/folders/nr/w0698dl96j39_fq33lqd8pk80000gn/T/_MEIP12KxC/myfile
believed me, I tried a lot of various method (abspath, os.realpath..)to get the current dir, no one worked fine once in an executable file.
