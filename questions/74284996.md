# problem with login response error handling

there is a Live data that takes care of the login response.
it returns the response body or the server error message. when the response is not successful everything is fine, even when the response in not successful also everything is fine
the problem appears when I first enter an incorrect user credential (obviously I'll get the error message) and then I correct the credential information and try to login again, in this situation both code in "if" block and "else" block will run, seems like the live data updates with delay,I couldn't solve the issue even with the delay functions
