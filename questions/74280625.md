# Robot Framework - Is there a way to get the current file name I am right now in?

I am using Page Object Model in Robot Framework Test Automation and I am trying to pick up the test data using the page object file name. So I would like to read the file name in which I am currently in.

Is there a way to pick up the file name from login.po.resource so that I can pick up the relevant test data automatically ?
I tried ${SUITE SOURCE} but that would only give me Test Suite Name.
Also tried to define a pythod library with file; But that gives me the library name.
