# getApplicationContext in a new Thread

In my main Activity, I have to give a bit of a delay before firing some code to get the states of my In App Purchases. So within a main activity's function I call:
// Need to fire this with a delay
new Thread() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {this.sleep(3000);} catch (InterruptedException e) {/*e.printStackTrace();*/}
        MainActivity ctx = (MainActivity) getApplicationContext();
        if(ctx != null) ctx.getIAP("", true);
    }
}.start();

The program crashes on the line MainActivity cnt = (MainActivity) getApplicationContext();.
The sleep just before works fine.
Any idea what I am doing wrong?
The 'new Thread' part is inside a function of the MainActivity class.
Where I am calling getApplicationContext, I assume this will be referring to the Thread.
