# Is there a way to use string interpolation with an SF Symbol that has a modifier on it?

I want to use string interpolation on an SF Symbol that has a rotationEffect(_:anchor:) modifier applied to it. Is it possible to do this?
Without the modifier this type of string interpolation works fine (in Swift 5.0):
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Some text before \(Image(systemName: "waveform.circle")) plus some text after.")
    }
}

But applying the modifier like this:
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Some text before \(Image(systemName: "waveform.circle").rotationEffect(.radians(.pi * 0.5))) plus some text after.")
    }
}

doesn't compile and gives this error:

Instance method 'appendInterpolation' requires that 'some View' conform to '_FormatSpecifiable'
