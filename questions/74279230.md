# Rule to List and edit a single collection in mongodb

I would like to ask a question, I did the procedure below and managed to create a rule and the user.

I just need to list a "logs-consumer" collection, because this user will be from a service, so the restriction on just listing this collection and editing it, I would just like the collection that I will inform in the role. Can someone help me?

Below are the commands used to create the rule and the user along with the print of the collections he listed me, remembering that I only need "logs-consumer".
use myDb
db.createRole({role: 'testRole', privileges: [{resource: {db:'myDb', collection:'my-collection'}, actions:['find','update','insert','remove']}], roles: [{ "role": "read", "db": "myDb" }]})
db.createUser({user:'test',pwd:'password',roles:[{role:'testRole', db:'myDb'}]})
Print of how the above rule behaves, but I just need it to list the "logs-consumer" collection

Print list collections
