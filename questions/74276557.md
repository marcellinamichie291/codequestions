# Are global variables thread-safe in Flask? How do I share data between requests?

In my application, the state of a common object is changed by making requests, and the response depends on the state.
class SomeObj():
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.param = param
    def query(self):
        self.param += 1
        return self.param

global_obj = SomeObj(0)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    flash(global_obj.query())
    render_template('index.html')

If I run this on my development server, I expect to get 1, 2, 3 and so on.  If requests are made from 100 different clients simultaneously, can something go wrong? The expected result would be that the 100 different clients each see a unique number from 1 to 100. Or will something like this happen:

Client 1 queries. self.param is incremented by 1.
Before the return statement can be executed, the thread switches over to client 2. self.param is incremented again.
The thread switches back to client 1, and the client is returned the number 2, say.
Now the thread moves to client 2 and returns him/her the number 3.

Since there were only two clients, the expected results were 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. A number was skipped.
Will this actually happen as I scale up my application? What alternatives to a global variable should I look at?
