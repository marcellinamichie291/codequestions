# how to open a website in a platform browser(safari, etc) from a web version app running in a webview

I have a very special case, that a webview widget in a flutter app runs another flutter web app, and the flutter web app has a button that opens a link by using urlLauncher.
I want to open the link with the default application but the web app just opens the link in the web view widget.
I tried all options in launchMode and they all have the same result.
how to solve this?
