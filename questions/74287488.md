# Extracting just Month and Year separately from Pandas Datetime column

I have a Dataframe, df, with the following column:
df['ArrivalDate'] =
...
936   2012-12-31
938   2012-12-29
965   2012-12-31
966   2012-12-31
967   2012-12-31
968   2012-12-31
969   2012-12-31
970   2012-12-29
971   2012-12-31
972   2012-12-29
973   2012-12-29
...

The elements of the column are pandas.tslib.Timestamp.
I want to just include the year and month.  I thought there would be simple way to do it, but I can't figure it out.
Here's what I've tried:
df['ArrivalDate'].resample('M', how = 'mean')

I got the following error:
Only valid with DatetimeIndex or PeriodIndex 

Then I tried:
df['ArrivalDate'].apply(lambda(x):x[:-2])

I got the following error:
'Timestamp' object has no attribute '__getitem__' 

Any suggestions?
Edit: I sort of figured it out.  
df.index = df['ArrivalDate']

Then, I can resample another column using the index.
But I'd still like a method for reconfiguring the entire column.  Any ideas?
