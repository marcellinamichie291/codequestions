# Is there a way to zero-initialize a mmap()'ed region with one kernel-call?

If I do an anonymous mmap() the pages aren't initially assigned to individual physical pages. If I allocate a 1GB region on my Linux-PC and write-touch each page sequentially it takes about 1.8ms per page for the kernel to assign a physical page. Is there a way to advise the kernel to assign a row of pages physical memory in one explicit call ? I think that could be much faster.
