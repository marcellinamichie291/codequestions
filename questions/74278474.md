# Recurstion stack overflow and I dont understand why

A 2 dimensional array with a size of NxN, composed of 1 and 0.
a neighbor is a 1 in the north/south/west/east of the index
Recursively find how many neighbors an index in the array has (neighbors that touch other neighbors are also included).
For the array I built I should get 6, but instead I get a stack overflow exception, and I don't get why.
below is my 7x7 array, that for index 2,5 should return the value of 6.
static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int[,] arr = { {0,0,0,1,0,0,0 },{1,0,0,1,1,0,0 },{0,0,0,0,1,1,0 },{0,0,0,0,1,0,0 },{0,0,0,0,0,0,0 },{0,1,1,1,1,0,0 },{1,0,0,1,0,0,0 } };
            Console.WriteLine(Recursive(arr,2,5));
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
        static public int Recursive(int[,] arr,int x,int y) 
        {   
            if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x > arr.GetLength(0) || y > arr.GetLength(1))
            {
                return 0;
            }
            // check if a 1 has neighbors
            if (arr[x, y] == 1)
            {
              return 1 + Recursive(arr,x-1,y) +Recursive(arr, x + 1, y) + Recursive(arr, x, y -1) +Recursive(arr, x, y + 1);
            }
            else
            {
                return 0;
            }                   
        }
