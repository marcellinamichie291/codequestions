# Update a scheduler dynamically on a button click python

I am making a flask application. So I have this schedule page where I get user values for how many days once that I have to run this function. Initially I have set up values for scheduler function initially but when I post the form values for scheduler I wanna be able to dynamically change the scheduler values and I couldn't do it
MY CODE:
 #The function which calls the scheduler function
 @app.route('/scheduler', methods =["GET", "POST"])
 def abc():
    sch_fun()
 return abc

#The code which executes scheduler function executes
def runalls()
  return runalls

#The scheduler function
def sch_fun():
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents=f.readlines()
    scheduler_val=contents[0].split()[0]
schedule.every(scheduler_val).seconds.do(runalls)

So I tried many methods but I wasn't able to update the scheduler_val dynamically when the abc() function executes. Please help if u guys know
