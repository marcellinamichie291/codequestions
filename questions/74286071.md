# Why can templates only be implemented in the header file?

Quote from The C++ standard library: a tutorial and handbook:

The only portable way of using templates at the moment is to implement them in header files by using inline functions.

Why is this?
(Clarification: header files are not the only portable solution. But they are the most convenient portable solution.)
