for example,
class Foo {
  oldItem: number;
  addedItem: number;
}

let's say I added addedItem field to class Foo, and I want to describe what I have done in a commit message.
How would you describe that exact field?
Because it is not Foo.addedItem nor Foo.prototype.addedItem, but new Foo().addedItem. Though it is a bit awkward to write feat(): added new Foo().addedItem in a commit message section. Any suggestions?
