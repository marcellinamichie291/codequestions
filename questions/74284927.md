# SwiperJS Smooth Transition with slideTo()

I wondering if anybody can point me to the correct direction. I am implementing a SwiperJS slider that's similar to swiperJS virtual slides demo where the pagination is a text. However, in the demo, the click isn't smooth, but rather it jumps to the slides.
Is there a way to have that slideTo method have the same effect as a normal transition?
I've been reading the documention, but I could have missed something. Most of the samples have been dots. However, I did find this sample where renderBullet can be used, but mine is returning two sets of buttons. Still trying if this might work.
