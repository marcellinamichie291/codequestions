# TypeError: string indices must be integers --> Python

I wanted to create a python function which should read each
character of a text file and then count and display
the occurrence of alphabets E and T individually (including
small cases e and t too).
def test():
    f = open("poem.txt",'r')
    count = 0
    count1 =0
    try:
        line = f.readlines()
        for i in line:
            for x in line:
                if (i[x] in 'Ee'):
                    count+=1
                else:
                    if (i[x] in 'Tt'):
                        count1+=1
        print("E or e",count)
        print("T or t",count1)
    except EOFError:
        f.close()
test()

This is what I tried
And it gave :
File "/Users/ansusinha/Desktop/Tution/Untitled15.py", line 23, in test
    if (i[x] in 'Ee'):
TypeError: string indices must be integers

What am I missing here?
