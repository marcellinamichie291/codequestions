# import error with tkcalendar module on visual studio code but not replit.com

I am not sure what I am doing wrong and as I said in the title this problem happens in visual studio code but not replit.
from tkinter import *
from tkcalendar import Calendar
import tkinter.messagebox

I have no idea why this is not working on vscode
and the error message I get is.
importerror: cannot import name "calendar" from partially initialized module "tkcalendar"
