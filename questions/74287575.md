# Is it possible to link different google forms to one spreadsheet tab?

I have multiple forms that should be linked to one spreadsheet. These form are created by a cron function using google api, they all are made by one template, so the structure and content for all forms are the same.
The problem is that the answers for each form is saved in different sheet tabs. Is there a possibility to save all the answers from different forms to one sheet tab ('Sheet1' for example)? Thanks.
