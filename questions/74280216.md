# Processing SQL Updates

I have a table with Table name, Id, Column Name and Value
I need to run these into a Azure SQL Database as updates.
The tables are all different with different columns for the update.
The only way I could think of is RBAR, but there has to be an easier way to process this, either SQL or maybe even data factory?
Example of the data is:
Table Name    Id    Column Name    Value
Table 1       1234  column1        1
Table 1       1234  column2        2022-01-02
Table 2       4321  column6        2144
Table 2       4321  column12       2022-01-02

The column name could be any column in the table with a update value.
As mentioned I have tried Row By Agonising Row but, as you would expect, WAY too painful as I have approx 161K rows that need processing.
