# Line break after every 20th number in Java (for-loop)

I am trying to write a program, which shows numbers 1 to 100. I would like to have a line break after every 20th number. I have tried using a counterloop, which resets itself after every 20th number, but the program runs infinite. How do I fix this?
public class zahlen1_bis_100 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {


        for (int x = 1; x <= 100; x++) {
            for (int counter = 1;counter <= 20; counter++) {

                    if (counter == 20) {

                        System.out.println();
                        counter = 1;
                    }
                }
             System.out.print(x + " ");
            }

        }

    }
