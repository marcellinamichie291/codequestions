# Cannot solve "A named connection string was used, but the name 'DefaultConnection' was not found in the application's configuration." error

I am new to .NET Core 6, coming from .NET Framework.
I configured connection string in appsettings.json file, this way:
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=Plataforma;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False;"
}

Then, I scaffolded from an existing database, this way:
Scaffold-DbContext -Connection name=DefaultConnection 
        -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 
        -OutputDir Models/DB -Force -NoPluralize

Database was scaffolded correctly. When I try to use it, I get this error:

A named connection string was used, but the name 'DefaultConnection'
was not found in the application's configuration. Note that named
connection strings are only supported when using 'IConfiguration' and
a service provider, such as in a typical ASP.NET Core application.

I saw that the Db context created has this method, in generated Plataforma class, which is derived from DbContext:
    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("name=DefaultConnection");
        }
    }

When debugging, I saw that IsConfigured is false, so it calls UseSqlServer method and after that, IsConfigured becomes true.
By reading other posts here in S.O., I added this in Program.cs file:
builder.Services.AddDbContext<Plataforma>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

However, when debugging, I saw that IsConfigured property is still false when called OnConfiguring method, so it tries to configure again using that named connection.
How can I solve this?
