Now I would like to add an additional column based on the values of the Position column.
I would like to create a column called role and this column has only 3 values (Chef, Assistant and Collegial)
Everything in the position who is only chef will have in the role the name one.
Everything in the position who is something with collegial will have in the role the name  collegial.
Everything in the position who is something with assistant will have in the role the name  assistant.
I am expecting these output

I don't know how to code it? Could someone please help. The problem is some names in the column have also chef.
