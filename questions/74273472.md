# Downloading html page

So i'm trying to download a HTML web-page and it downloads the website file structure. It looks just perfect on desktop orientation but goes wrong on mobile orientation tho. Is there any way to download the mobile orientated page or smth?
Important to say that it downloads a HTML file and a folder with javascript and css files. Everything looks just like needed on PC screened orientation but the mobile orientation doesn't look right
