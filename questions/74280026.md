# TYPE APPLICATION OVERLAY in android 11 permission denied

I tried to create a overlay app for android 11 and I see that I can't use the
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY" />

in android 11 only if this is a system app
so I make it for a system app and I still not able to preform a system overlay
I get this error
     Caused by: android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window android.view.ViewRootImpl$W@10f390 -- permission denied for window type 2006
