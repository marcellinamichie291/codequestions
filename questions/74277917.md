# How to redirect a form submission to different pages based on values entered?

I have a form that captures general information like name, sex, age, and email, etc..
I want to achieve something like this:

If someone for example selects "female" and "40-45" then clicks submit, I want the form to go to /female-40-45. Both of the sex and age range are options within a select box.

Thanks for your help.
Not sure how to write the conditional logic for this form submission.
