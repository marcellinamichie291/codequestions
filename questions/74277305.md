# Issue setting up Simba ODBC Connector for BigQuery on Excel for Macbook running M2 Chips

I've been trying to configure Simba's BigQuery ODBC connector to run BQ queries through the Mac Version of Excel on Office 365 and have been unable to properly load the driver.
I'm using iODBC Manager 3.52.12 as an ODBC Manager and have run through the different versions of the simba driver. The iODBC administrator app comes in 2 versions: iODBCAdministrator (Apple Silicon) and iODBCAdministrator64 (Intel64bit).  I have an Macbook pro M2, so tried to use the Apple Silicon version, but keep getting the message:
1: SQLDriverConnect = [iODBC][Driver Manager]dlopen(/Library/simba/googlebigqueryodbc/lib/libgooglebigqueryodbc_sbu.dylib, 0x0006): tried: '/Library/simba/googlebigqueryodbc/lib/libgooglebigqueryodbc_sbu.dylib' (fat file, but missing compatible architecture (have (i386,x86_64) (0) SQLSTATE=00000
2: SQLDriverConnect = [iODBC][Driver Manager]Specified driver could not be loaded (0) SQLSTATE=IM003
Weirdly, if I use iODBCAdministrator64, I am able to successfully test the connection.  However, when I try to use Microsoft Query in Excel, I get the same error message as above.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
