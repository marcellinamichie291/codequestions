# Cypress commands - component architecture / structure

I've got a lot of components and each component has a number of re-usable commands specific to that component. At the moment I have done this as follows:
// table component example (I have more components and commands)
export const getTable = (tableName: string) => cy.get(`.table-${tableName}`);
Cypress.Commands.add('getTable', getTable);

export const haveTableWithRows = (tableName: string, tableRows: number) => {
  cy.getTable(tableName).get('tbody tr').should('have.length', tableRows);
};
Cypress.Commands.add('haveTableWithRows', haveTableWithRows);

declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable<Subject> {
       getTable: typeof getTable;
       haveTableWithRows: typeof haveTableWithRows;
       // each component command declared here too....
    }
  }
}

cy.getTable()
cy.haveTableWithRows()


So my question, is there an easier way to set this up for a component architecture? I would like them namespaced under the component name and only been added once for each component. The above example, requires adding a lot of code for each command.
I would like to Cypress.Commands.add a number of commands at once (for a single component) and declare the interface / namespace for each component without having to specify each function and it's typeof.
So ideally, i would have like this:

// from what I understand I can't actually do this as it requires a function
Cypress.Commands.add('table', table);

declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable<Subject> {
       table: typeof table; // instead of adding each component command
    }
  }
}

// and use the commands like this.
cy.table.get(); // instead of cy.getTable()
cy.table.rows(); // instead of cy.haveTableWithRows()

Does anyone know of a way to create re-usable component commands in an efficient way?
