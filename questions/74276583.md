# Refer to base class with self when called from subclass

I'm having trouble understanding/using inheritance with self. The following is an MRE of the situation:
class Foo:
    def baz(self, num):
        if num <= 0:
            return

        print(f"Base: {num}")
        self.baz(num - 1)


class Bar(Foo):
    def baz(self, num):
        if num <= 0:
            return

        print(f"Sub: {num}")
        super().baz(num - 1)


Bar().baz(3)

The output of the above code is:
Sub: 3
Base: 2
Sub: 1

My question is: why does self.baz(num - 1) in Foo call Bar.baz? I can see in my debugger that self refers to an instance of the Bar class, but I don't understand why it works this way. And whatever the answer, how do I go about referring to the current method (in Foo), while using the current self object? In other words, whether self currently refers to a Foo object or a Bar object, I'd like to call Foo.baz.
My intended output is:
Sub: 3
Base: 2
Base: 1
