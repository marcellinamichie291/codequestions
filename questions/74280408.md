# Is it possible to use the Python Embeddable package as the vscode interperter?

I have the vscode python extension, which requires a Python interpreter. When trying to use the Python installer, it asks for the admin password which I don't have. However, the embeddable comes with a Python executable, so I figured I could just use that. But when setting it to use the python.exe that comes in the embeddable package, it gives me this error.

I tried many things, like using pythonw.exe instead of python.exe. I tried extracting python311.zip, and it still gives the error.
Am I doing something wrong, or is it just impossible to use the embeddable package as the interperter?
