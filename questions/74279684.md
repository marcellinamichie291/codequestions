# Is there a way to grant access to a ServiceAccount from all namespaces in Kubernetes? Or a cluster-wide ServiceAccount?

I'm going to have an unknown number of users access my K8s (specifically OpenShift if that helps) cluster.  Each user will have their own random namespace.  So I do not know the namespaces in advance as they will be dynamically created. But I want each user to be able to utilize a ServiceAccount that I create ahead of time.
So, if I create a ServiceAccount fooSA in my namespace foo, I'd like to be able to define a deployment that utilizes fooSA from the bar namespace.  For example:
myapp.yaml
...
spec:
  serviceAccount: fooSA
...

kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml -n bar
How can I accomplish this?
As ServiceAccounts are namespace scoped I cannot figure out a way to accomplish this.
