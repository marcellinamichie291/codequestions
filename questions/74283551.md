# Can we run automated tests using flutter_driver on Firebase Test Lab?

I am able to run automation tests on sample flutter application using flutter_driver on Android Emulator. I am looking for options of executing on Device Clouds. There are few threads which talk about executions on AWS Device Farm. However, I am interested in Firebase Test Lab. Similar to how we can execute automated scripts in SauceLabs, is there an option to run automated tests in Firebase Test Lab using flutter_driver?
