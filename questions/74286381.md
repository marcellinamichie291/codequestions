# how to prevent fluentui/react Button from firing after a click?

I am using the button from fluentui/react (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/button) and I would like to put a condition on onClick event to prevent the event from firing if the condition is false.
I tried both event.preventDefault(); and event.stopPropagation(); but they did not work.
How can I prevent the onclick event from firing if the condition does not meet?
//The button is inside a child compoment.

const handleOnClick = async (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement | HTMLDivElement | HTMLAnchorElement | HTMLSpanElement | BaseButton | Button, MouseEvent>) =>{         
event.stopPropagation();                                                            
event.preventDefault();
  ...
  }

<PrimaryButton onClick={(event) => handleOnClick(event)}>Save</PrimaryButton>

searched but found nothing that could help me in this particular example.
