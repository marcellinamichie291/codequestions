# How can I import a repository into an Azure DevOps Project using SSH?

I'm trying to migrate a bunch of projects from a corporate Gitlab account to Azure DevOps. Az Devops has a handy "Import a repository" option... but it only has a field for a Clone URL (ie https).

Is there a way for me to use SSH? The Gitlab account I'm migrating from has HTTPS disabled.
I added my SSH key to Az Devops, tried using the SSH link in the field, tried using a hand-crafted https (obviously didn't work).
I tried finding a command to do it from Git CLI but couldn't find anything. The closest I've found is creating a brand new repo, copying everything from the old repo, and pushing to the new one.
