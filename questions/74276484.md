# How can I pass content to a parent template from a child template in Silverstripe

I want to pass some content from a elemental block up to a parent template (to change the page header)   - Is this possible?  I don't have any example code for what I'm trying because I don't have any idea how to implement it.
This would be similar to the content_for facility in Rails / ERB templates.
Parent:
Page Title <%= yield :title %>


Child Template:
<% content_for :title do %>
  <b>, A simple page</b>
<% end %>

Is there anything like this or some other way to do this in SS templates?
