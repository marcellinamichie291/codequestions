# Do I have to rewrite package directory one by one when I change directory of java file on vim?

These days, I am practicing myself to develop Java(Spring Boot) using Vim.
And I just wonder if I have to rewrite package directory in Java file one by one when I change it.
For example, in Java file we should write package directory on top of the file like below.
package com.example.demo.controller;

public class TestController {
...
}

I am wondering if there is any way to change the file contents synchronously when I change the directory of file in Vim.
Thank you in advance.
When I changed the directory of file by m + m(move the current node), I realized in the package directory in the file and also in files which imported that file, the directory has changed.
