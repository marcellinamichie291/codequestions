# Changing icon on Microsoft Access database

This has been driving me crazy, and I really don't understand why it doesn't work...
I am trying to change the icon for my Access database using VBA, and it /almost/ works.
I am using the following code in the OnOpen event of my startup form:
    CurrentDb.Properties("AppIcon").Value = CurrentProject.Path & "\favicon.ico"
    CurrentDb.Properties("UseAppIconForFrmRpt").Value = True
    Application.RefreshTitleBar

The icon shows up in the titlebar and main Access window just fine, however, the icon does NOT show up on forms. The weird thing is: It DOES show up on reports. Can anyone fill me in on what the H is going on? Thank you in advance!
