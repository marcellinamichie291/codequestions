# Javascript for...of is not working as expected with await

for...of is not working as expected while await is added inside the loop. However, when the conventional for loop is used then it produces the correct output.
    for (const appInvocationRule of appInvocationRules) {
      const ruleProd = await appInvocationRule.getProduct()
    }
