# Ignore type checking of node modules files

Is there any way to ignore the node modules files while running the npm run check-types command?
I already tried adding the flag skipLibCheck, but it only ignores .d.ts files. The package I'm using consists of .ts files as well. I also tried some other ways like including maxNodeModuleJsDepth and set its value to 0, but that also didn't work.
