# Vector dev how to use hypenated key names?

Sometimes, when processing log events in vector, a log source might have hyphens as key names - for example json structured logs. Assuming it is from a third party and changing them there is not an option, how can we handle these keys?
A sample log message (contrived for demonstration) is:
{
  "labels":{"no_hypens":"normal field","this-has-hypens":"this is a test"},
  "message":"a message",
  "timestamp":"2022-11-01T12:03:00.941866394Z"
}

Note the field labels.this-has-hyphens there.
