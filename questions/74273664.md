# Cloning of a project from Git to Intellij using HTTPS not working

I am trying to setup Intellij for a project from github repository. While trying to clone the repo, it gives the following error :
unable to access 'https://github.com/petro-it/x.git/': Received HTTP code 404 from proxy after CONNECT
I know this is related to server issue, FYI, server is working fine and credentials too.
