It is possible with MSVC to create a so-called resource-only DLL which essentually is a DLL that contains no machine code, but only resources. Is there a way to create a DLL only resource file using mingw? (If not possible, is it possible using open source tools?)
I know you can use windres to compile rc files into .res files. But the resources are appended with the compiler. but what if I have nothing to compile?
