# How to use sessions in a Laravel API?

I'm aware about it being anti-pattern and down-right absurd, but looking for a way regardless. The idea is for the API to detect whether the current user is logged in or not, and return an 'is_login' param respectively in json format.
I've already tried adding StartSession under 'api' in Kernel.php but it did nothing.
