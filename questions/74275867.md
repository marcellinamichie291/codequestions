# Odoo DIN5008 append or change information_block via XPATH

I'm in a similar situation like:
Odoo DIN5008 append or change information_block
I'd like to add some fields (e.g. the customer number) to the DIN5008 information_block in quotation and invoice PDF reports, but I'd like to do it via QWeb inheritance only, i.e. without patching the python code. However, I cannot seem to get to the information_block via XPATH at all, neither via <xpath expr="//t[@t-foreach='template_data']" position="after"> (as taken from the source template) nor via <xpath expr="//div[@class='information_block'] position=after> (as taken from the code that's been rendered to the client).
I assume this is due to the template being a different file than what I can reach via inheriting from report_saleorder_document.
I can't figure out how to inherit from external_layout_din5008, and even if I figured that out, how would I differentiate the document type that's currently rendered?
