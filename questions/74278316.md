# Deploy multiple VM from an OVF file

I'm trying to deploy multiple VMware from an OVF file to VCenter. I using the same code but split to 2 tasks
This is my code:
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  collections:
    - community.vmware
  vars_files:
    - include_vars: vars.yml
  tasks:
      - name: deploy ovf
        vmware_deploy_ovf:
          hostname: "{{ hostname }}"
          username: "{{ username }}"
          password: "{{ password }}"
          validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"
          datacenter: "{{ datacenter }}"
          name: "{{ vm_name }}"
          ovf: "{{ ovf_path }}"
          cluster: "{{ cluster }}"
          wait_for_ip_address: true
          inject_ovf_env: false
          power_on: no
          datastore: "{{ datastore }}"
          networks: "{u'Management Network':u'Management Network'}"
          disk_provisioning: thin

     - name: Sleep for 300 seconds and continue with play
       wait_for:
         timeout: 300
       delegate_to: localhost

     - name: deploy ovf 2
       vmware_deploy_ovf:
          hostname: "{{ hostname }}"
          username: "{{ username }}"
          password: "{{ password }}"
         .......
