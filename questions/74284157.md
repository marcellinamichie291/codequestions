# MySQL Explain - what this mean : Filtered 100.0 but rows is low

My name is Pascal and i have a question on the EXPLAIN function in MYSQL
I have a table Logs_activeusers (id, ifuser, dateLog)
I have an index on dateLog (timestamp)...
In this query :
explain SELECT * FROM `logs_activeusers` WHERE datelog>1583703429

The Explain table show me this :
rows = 10412
filtered = 100.0
Does that mean that the query pass over all rows ?
Because i have 2 millions rows.. So why filtered is 100.0 and rows is only 10412 ?
Does my query is OK ?
Because i don't want the query looks at all rows..
Thanks a lot !
Pascal
