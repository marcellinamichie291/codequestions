# dotnet build looking for GeneratedMSBuildEditorConfig.editorconfig file?

I'm trying to build a .NET 6 Xamarin iOS app using .NET CLI.
This question is a follow up of this one.
Now the problem is that after a while the build fails with the following error:

#[error]CSC(0,0): Error CS2001: Source file '/Users/runner/work/1/s/TestApplication/obj/arm64/ReleaseiPhone/net6.0-ios16.0/ios-arm64/TestApplication.GeneratedMSBuildEditorConfig.editorconfig' could not be found.

AFAIK this file is used by Visual Studio and has nothing to do with the .NET CLI.
