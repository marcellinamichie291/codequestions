# Spring-Data-Neo4j 6: how to automate unique constraints creation?

I am doing some experiments with the following technologies:

Neo4j 4.4 (community edition)
Spring-Boot 2.7.5
Spring-Data-Neo4j 6.3.5

and I am trying to understand how to automate the creation of unique constraints for a @Node entity.
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.GeneratedValue;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Id;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Node;

import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;
import java.util.UUID;

@Data
@Node
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Organization {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private UUID id;

    // TODO: Annotation for automatic unique constraint generation
    @NotEmpty
    private String name;
}

Based on the SDN6 docs
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/6.3.5/reference/html/#migrating.autoindex
the Automatic index manager and the relevant Neo4j-OGM annotations (@Index, @CompositeIndex, @Required) have been removed in favor of database versioning tools like:

https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations
https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-neo4j

Considering the SDN6 docs https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/6.3.5/reference/html/#faq.sdn-related-to-ogm

How does SDN relate to Neo4j-OGM?
Neo4j-OGM is an Object Graph Mapping
library, which is mainly used by previous versions of Spring Data
Neo4j as its backend for the heavy lifting of mapping nodes and
relationships into domain object. The current SDN does not need and
does not support Neo4j-OGM. SDN uses Spring Dataâ€™s mapping context
exclusively for scanning classes and building the meta model.

The nearest option seems to be using the Neo4j Migrations Annotation Processor
https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations/current/#appendix_annotation
but it seems to rely on the Neo4j-OGM for generating the unique constraints:

https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/tree/main/extensions/neo4j-migrations-annotation-processing/processor/src/test/java/ac/simons/neo4j/migrations/annotations/proc/ogm
https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/blob/main/extensions/neo4j-migrations-annotation-processing/processor/src/test/java/ac/simons/neo4j/migrations/annotations/proc/ogm/SingleIndexEntity.java
https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/blob/main/extensions/neo4j-migrations-annotation-processing/processor/src/test/java/ac/simons/neo4j/migrations/annotations/proc/ogm/UniqueConstraintEntity.java
https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/tree/main/extensions/neo4j-migrations-annotation-processing/processor/src/test/java/ac/simons/neo4j/migrations/annotations/proc/sdn6

How can I configure the Neo4j automatic index creation using one of the suggested migration tools in Spring-Boot-Data-Neo4j 6?
