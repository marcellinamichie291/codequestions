# How to generate x509 certificate from key-pair certificates?

I am trying to implement an OAuth2 in GRPC connection and I found TLS/SSL support on this page. I generated server-cert.pem file and server-key.pem file in my cert folder for mutual connection between client and server. Now, in Go I am familiar of tls.loadX509KeyPair(server-cert.pem, server-key.pem) method. However, I cannot find support for such a function in Node JS. Can anyone please help me with this problem?
I am expecting to load server's certificate and private key. Or, load x509 key pair and parse a public/private key pair from pair of files in node js.
