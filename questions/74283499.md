# How can TsFile synchronization tool of Apache IoTDB synchronize value of data with groups and time series?

I would like to ask a question on TsFile synchronization tool of Apache IoTDB. I know this tool is for data synchronization, but why it can only synchronize groups and time series, but the value of data is not synchronized? I started with Version 0.12.6 and later upgraded to Version 0.13.2, but the same problem happened in both versions. Anyone know how can I synchronize the data value?
