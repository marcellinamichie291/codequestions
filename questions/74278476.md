# Laravel getting value in a for each loop problem

i'm new to laravel. I'm creating a CRUD application and im trying to add a delete functionality to my blog application.I tried looping through for each loop to get the id of each blog. However, i can only get the id of the last item in the loop. How can i get the id of specific item in the for each loop so i can delete specific blog? can anyone guide me the right way to do this
This is what ive tried so far ( Registration view)
@foreach($records as $record)
<td class="row">

        <form class="pr-1" action="{{ url('fetchedit',[$record->user_id,$record->car_id]) }}" method="post">
            @csrf
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Edit</button>
        </form>

    <form class="pr-1" action="{{ url('deletelp',$record->car_id) }}" id="deleteForm">
        <a class=""><button onclick="showDelete()" type="button" class="btn btn-danger">
            </button></a>
    </form>
</td>`

@endforeach

My controller
public function deletelp($car_id)
{
    DB::delete('delete from registered_vehicle where car_id = ?', [$car_id]);
    return redirect('registration');

}
