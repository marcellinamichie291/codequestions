# Function of "[tool.setuptools.packages] find = {}" in pyproject.toml

The GitLab instructions for packaging a Python project for the package registry instruct users to create a pyproject.toml file with the following contents:
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "mypypipackage"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = [
    { name="Example Author", email="author@example.com" },
]
description = "A small example package"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
classifiers = [
   "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
   "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]

[tool.setuptools.packages]
find = {}

Can anyone explain what the function of find = {} in the bottom section is? The GitLab guide doesn't explain and I can't seem to find any documentation for this.
The .toml file works just fine as instructed of course, but it also seems to work fine without including the [tool.setuptools.packages] section altogether.
