# OnCollisionStay2D not calling when colliding with two objects

I am writing a code for ground and wall detection of a 2D game. The ground detection wihtin OnCollisionStay is working fine when colliding with only the floor. But as it reaches a corner and having collision wiht both the wall and the ground, the function oncollisionstay is just not called.

Both the ground and the circle has collider2d and rigidbody2d properties.
void OnCollisionStay2D(Collision2D col){
            
        num = 0;
        foreach (ContactPoint2D wallcontact in col.contacts){
            num+=1;
            position_collide = wallcontact.point;
            tempx = Player_position.x - position_collide.x;
            tempy = Player_position.y - position_collide.y;                
            angle = Mathf.Atan2(tempx,tempy);
            angle = angle / pi * 180;
            a = angle.ToString();
            if (angle>-2 && angle<2){
                onground = true;
                
                }
            else{
                onground = false;
            }
            if ((92<angle && angle>88 ) || (-92<angle && angle<-88)){
                onwall = true;
            }
            else{
                onwall = false;
            }
    }
    Debug.Log("incontact "+num.ToString()+" points");
}

This is the code I have got. And The last line that tells the incontact message stops showing after the ball collides with the wall and has two contact points.
