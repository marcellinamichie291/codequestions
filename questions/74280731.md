# undefined reference to 'pow' using makefile

I'm trying to use the pow function but the make command gives me this error. I did #include<math.h> at the start of the file.
Compiling the .c file on its own using gcc test.c -o test -lm works fine, but as part of my assignment, I have to use the makefile my instructors gave me. (What I'm guessing to be) its most relevant portion looks like this:
CFLAGS = -std=c99 -Wall -O -Wuninitialized -Wunreachable-code -pedantic
LFLAGS = -lm                          

What should I try, and can I fix this without changing the contents of the makefile? Thank you.
Edit:
Including all of my code would be a mess, but this is what causes the error:
int max = pow(2, n);

(n is an int)
