# How to setup port to subdomain in AWS?

I have a domain (e.g. example.com) registered with godaddy.com and use AWS for hosting.
Nameserver on Godaddy later added to AWS

I have an ubuntu (t2.medium) apache server installed. My project in Docker has LAMP, ELK, Node, React, and Postgres installed. Everything works on the local system using direct ports. Few ports open in my project i.e.

example.com:3000 react app [frontend]
example.com:5601 kibana app
example.com:5050 postgradmin app
example.com/radius php applicatinn [backend]
example.com:8080 phpmyadmin app

my desired URLs are:

example.com:3000 react app [frontend] => http://example.com
example.com:5601 kibana app => http://kibana.example.com
example.com:5050 postgradmin app => http://postgradmin.example.com
example.com/radius php applicatinn [backend] => http://example.com/radius
example.com:8080 phpmyadmin app => http://phpmyadmin.example.com

I have tried a few things but nothing is working. on route53

tried reverse proxy on apache by adding separate conf files e.g.
default.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin contact@example.com
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
    ServerName example.com
    <Directory "/var/www/html/">
        AllowOverride all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

kibana.conf
Listen 5601

<VirtualHost *:5601>
    ServerAdmin contact@example.com
    ServerName kibana.example.com
</VirtualHost>

pgadmin.conf
Listen 5050

<VirtualHost *:5050>
    ServerAdmin contact@example.com
    ServerName pgadmin.example.com
</VirtualHost>

when I run docker-compose up on EC2, http://example.com/radius works fine. but others do not (e.g. http://kibana.example.com). but if try with port directly (e.g. example.com:5601) it's working. but I want to use a sub-domain not a domain with a port.
How to do that?
reverse proxy I tried as mentioned in the description but it's not working properly
