# Is there a C# equivalent to the Python := (an assignment expression)?

Assignment expression Python 3.8
I like how it saves line. Example:
for rule in rules:
    place = getPlace(rule)
    if place:
        print(f"Apply rule {rule.__name__} -> {place}")
        return place
raise Exception('No rule found!')

↓↓
for rule in rules:
    if place:= getPlace(rule):
        print(f"Apply rule {rule.__name__} -> {place}")
        return place
raise Exception('No rule found!')

Is there a C# equivalent or it needs to use variable assignment on the line before?
