# KQL - WorkDays Restrict

i have a Question about an KQL Query.
I would like to restrict the Query only of the Work Days from Monday to Friday.
How can i build this in KQL Query?
Thanks a lot.
A short Edit:
How can i build this in a existing Query with a Timestamp "timestamp between (datetime(06:00) .. datetime(15:00))" ??
For Example here the Code:
availabilityResults
| where timestamp between (datetime(06:00) .. datetime(15:00))
| where true
| where name == "warmup" and true
| extend percentage = toint(success) * 100
| render timechart

And now i would like only have an Result when is an Work Day
Best Regards,
Phil
