# Bitbucket pipelines - run dotnet test after docker build

In my bitbucket-pipelines.yaml I have the following config for my dev branch:
dev:
   - step:
       name: Build and Test
       services:
         - docker
       script: 
         - export IMAGE_NAME=$REGISTRY_URL/$SERVICE_NAME:$BITBUCKET_BRANCH
         - docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .
         - rm -rf $BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR/*.Tests.*/TestResults
         - dotnet test $BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR/*.sln --logger "junit" --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
            
   - step:
       name: Generate Tests Report
       script:
         - export PATH="$PATH:/root/.dotnet/tools"
         - dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool --version 5.1.10
         - bash generate-tests-report.sh
       artifacts:
         - TestCoverageReport/**
         - TestCoverageReportsHistory/**

  - step:
      name: Tag and Push Image
      script:
         - export IMAGE_NAME=$REGISTRY_URL/$SERVICE_NAME:$BITBUCKET_BRANCH
         - export FULL_IMAGE_NAME=$IMAGE_NAME-$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER
         - docker login $REGISTRY_URL --username $REGISTRY_USERNAME --password $REGISTRY_PASSWORD
         - docker tag  $IMAGE_NAME $FULL_IMAGE_NAME
         - docker push $IMAGE_NAME
         - docker push $FULL_IMAGE_NAME
     
   - step:
       name: Deploy to dev

My Dockerfile looks like this (I don't want to run tests inside the docker image):
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY *.sln ./NuGet.config ./
COPY MyProject/MyProject.csproj MyProject/
RUN dotnet restore MyProject/MyProject.csproj
COPY . .
WORKDIR /src/MyProject
RUN dotnet build -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish
ARG assembly_version
RUN dotnet publish  /p:AssemblyVersion=${assembly_version} -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:80
CMD dotnet MyProject.dll

I get the following error bash: dotnet: command not found in the Build and Test step. I am aware why this happens, but how am I supposed to get access to the dotnet cli here. Should I specify the sdk image in the step, and if yes, wouldn't that try install the sdk image for the second time (first time in the Dockerfile). And then when I need the dotnet cli in the next steps, should I again specify the image...It seems counter productive to me to download the same image all over again in every step.
