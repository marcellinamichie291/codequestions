# How can I create an ODBC connection on cross os like Linux for the Access database

I am able to establish ODBC connection on Windows os for reading Access Database but I am unable to get the solution to implement this on cross os like Linux.
Does anyone know if this is possible and how to accomplish it? or any other Free/Paid tools available for this implementation.
I am having the Access DB locally but trying to establish connection on Linux but not working.
new PDO("odbc:Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)};DBq=$source_db_file_path;Uid=;Pwd=;");
