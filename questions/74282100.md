# AzureBlobStorage fails when enumerating Pageable<BlobContainerItem> result from GetBlobContainers with RequestFailedException, not authorized

I am building an infrastructure wrapper around Azure Blob Storage for a shared component in a .Net Core 6 suite of applications, both web and desktop-based applications. Iâ€™m using version 12.14.1 of Azure.Storage.Blobs.
public BlobContainerItem[] GetContainers(string sasToken)
{
 blobUri = "https://spiffyaccountname.blob.core.windows.net?" + sasToken;

 var client = new BlobServiceClient(blobUri);
 var containers = client.GetBlobContainers(); // Succeeds!
 var array = containers.array()               // Fails with Azure.RequestFailedException
 return array;
}

Exception Details:
Azure.RequestFailedException: This request is not authorized to perform this operation using this resource type.
RequestId:...
Time:...
Status: 403 (This request is not authorized to perform this operation using this resource type.)
ErrorCode: AuthorizationResourceTypeMismatch

I don't think it's a code issue but rather a configuration issue, as creating and deleting containers work fine, though I haven't been able to find the setting to fix it.
