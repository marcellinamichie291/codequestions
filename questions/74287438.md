# How to display the image from firebase on website using Javascript

Here is my js code
get(child(dbref, "Products/Paintings/Product1/Image")).then((snapshot) => {
if (snapshot.exists()) {
          $("#Image").append(snapshot.val())
        }
        else {
          alert("No Data Found")
        }
      })
        .catch((error) => {
          alert("unsuccessful" + error)
        });

Here is my HTML code:
<img id = "Image" class="default-img"  alt="#">

Image have hierarchy, Products>>Paintings>>Product1>>Image
I want to display it from firebase without clicking any button just to display it as the default image.
Can anyone help me out.
