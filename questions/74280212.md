# Polars scan s3 multi-part parquet files

I have a multipart partitioned parquet on s3. Each partition contains multiple parquet files. The below code narrows in on a single partition which may contain somewhere around 30 parquet files. When I use scan_parquet on a s3 address that includes *.parquet wildcard, it only looks at the first file in the partition. I verified this with the count of customers. It has the count from just the first file in the partition. Is there a way that it can scan across files?
import polars as pl

s3_loc = "s3://some_bucket/some_parquet/some_partion=123/*.parquet"
df = pl.scan_parquet(s3_loc)
cus_count = df.select(pl.count('customers')).collect()

If I leave off the *.parquet from the s3 address then I get the following error.
exceptions.ArrowErrorException: ExternalFormat("File out of specification: A parquet file must containt a header and footer with at least 12 bytes")
