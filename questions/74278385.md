# What is the meaning of the red exclamation mark inside a triangle next to the title of the reports in Google Analytics 4 (GA4)?

I have set up a GA4 account for my company's business website. It was set up about 4 months ago and I have been continually seeing an exclamation mark next to the title of the reports. Not sure what that means. Even the mouse-hovers doesn't give any legend info specific to the exclamation mark. Can anyone help me with it please?
