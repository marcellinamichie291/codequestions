# Telebot (pyTelegramBotAPI): how to wait for a single reply and stop the bot

I'm trying to implement a function in Python that would just send a message via telegram bot, wait for a single reply, stop the bot and return the reply.
The following code works correctly, but only once: on a second call telebot receives the same reply. Tried reading the docs (especially about polling), but got more confused, actually...What would be a simple way to achieve my goal?
def get_answer(question: str) -> str:
    bot = telebot.TeleBot('TOKEN')
    result = ''

    @bot.message_handler(func=lambda _: True)
    def handle_reply(message):
        nonlocal result
        result = message.text
        bot.stop_polling()

    bot.send_message(TELEGRAM_ID, question)
    bot.infinity_polling()

    return result
