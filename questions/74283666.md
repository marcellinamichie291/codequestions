# Is it possible to execute same liquibase for 2 applications at same time

I have two applications needs to be deployed at same time. Both having some common code, which is in another repo. In that common repo i have liquibase file. When i start the applictaions with time gap  this liquibase is executing and not causing any issue. But I am facing a issue, when two applications started same time, Getting exceptions.
My doubt is it possible to execute same liquibase at same time with different applications? Data base is same. And this should be done without doing any manual changes, like deleting record from changelog table manually.
The exception am getting is as follows

Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is liquibase.exception.ValidationFailedException: Validation Failed:
1 change sets check sum
FLIGHT-DB-CHANGELOG-SCRIPT-SDT-845.XML-v1-dev::31-10-2022-IGE-6388::.....@.......com is now: 7:27d219f2f30604542a4a458c891cdbc7

Please help me out. Thank you
