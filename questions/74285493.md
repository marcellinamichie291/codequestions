# How can I build an object in React(typescript) based on an array of objects

I have two user objects:
const user = {
    startDate: new Date('2022-10-06'),
    endDate: new Date('2022-10-10'),
    id:'1234',
    title: 'Title 1'
  };

const user2 = {
    startDate: new Date('2022-10-12'),
    endDate: new Date('2022-10-17'),
    id: '1112',
    title: 'Title 2'
  };

and an array with these two objects and an empty object called dateToUserMap:
  const users = [user, user2];
  const dateToUserMap = {};

I want to add data to dateToUserMap and it needs to look like this:
dateToUserMap = {
    '01.11.2022': [
      {
        id: 'asd',
        title: 'asd'
      }
    ],
    '02.11.2022': [
      {
        id: 'asd',
        title: 'asd'
      },
      {
        id: 'asd1',
        title: 'asd1'
      }
    ],
    '03.11.2022': [
      {
        id: 'asd1',
        title: 'asd1'
      }
    ]
  };

dateToUserMap should be an object with the days of the intervals of each user in chronological order (in my case should be days from 10/6 until 10/10 and 10/12 until 10/17), and each day should have an array of objects with the id and title of the users in that interval.
I tried using forEach to loop trough the users in the users array and calculated the interval of each user but I don't know how to pass that data in the object with all the dates and the id and title
users.forEach(user => {   
    const interval = eachDayOfInterval({ start: user.startDate, end: user.endDate });
    console.log(interval);
  });

I use date-fns library to help me work with dates and when I log the interval to console I get this:
