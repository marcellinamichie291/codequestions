Please help with ideas on how I can plot a heatmap with three variables: Entity, Year, and Category. My data looks like below:

I am hoping to have the 'Entity' on the y-axis, 'Year' on the x-axis, and the heatmap to vary based on the Status (i.e., 0,1,2,3).
Something that looks like a stacked horizontal bar chart would probably do the job for this viz as well (as long as the the Status remains a categorical variable and not a count.
