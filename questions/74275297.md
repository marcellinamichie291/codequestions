some time ago I came across a website for learning Python. I already have experience with Python, but I did a few tasks for fun.
There are of course a few of these websites, but this one showed suggestions from other users after each task. These were sorted by the most compact and smartest solution, I believe, which others have upvoted. I found this interesting despite my previous experience because its nice to improve ones code quality.
Now my problem: I recently wanted to recommend this website to friends who want to learn Python, but I couldn't find it anymore, because I just registered for testing it with a random email.
Do any of you know such a wesite and can tell me the name?
If that helps: I can remember that it had a darkmode design and during the task you had a window with the task and one for the code and at the bootom or top two buttons "Test code" and "Submit" (or something like that).
Thanks in advance!
