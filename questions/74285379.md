# Show TreeSet in Scala / Java

Is there a way, in Scala, to print a TreeSet in a way it stored in the memory?
For example, in case I initialize a tree
val tree_1: TreeSet[Int] = TreeSet(4, 2, 1)

I would expect to see something like -
    4
   /
  2
 /
1

But when I try to approach to root, all I can see is -
println(tree_1.head) //>> 1
println(tree_1.firstKey) //>> 1

Same happens for
val tree_2: TreeSet[Int] = TreeSet(2, 1, 4)

I would expect to see -
    2
   / \
  1   4

But I get the same result -
println(tree_2.head) //>> 1
println(tree_2.firstKey) //>> 1
