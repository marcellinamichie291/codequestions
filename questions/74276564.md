# Buddycommerce Membership Display

I'm integrating buddyboss with buddycommerce, so we can see the type of membership.
but we can only see our membership (current user), how do we get other users to see our membership type, or we can see another user membership displayed on buddyboss profile page..

Buddycommerce membership display as public
