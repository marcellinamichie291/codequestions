# Pairwise mean of all elements of 2 lists

Is there a function to all crosswise means (or sums or whatever) of 2 lists in python?
I can write a nested loop to do this:
import numpy as np

A = [1,2,3]
B = [8,12,11]

C = np.empty((len(A),len(B)))
for i, x in enumerate(A):
    for j, y in enumerate(B):
        C[i][j] = np.mean([x,y])

result:
array([[4.5, 6.5, 6. ],
       [5. , 7. , 6.5],
       [5.5, 7.5, 7. ]])

but it feels like this is a very roundabout way to do this.
I guess there is an option for a nested list comprehension as well, but that also seems ugly.
Is there a more pythonic solution?
