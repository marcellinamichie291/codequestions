# VB.NET Get Local Computer Name

I need to retrieve the local (not server) machine name on an intranet web application. After a lot of searching, it looks like the below should work...
Dim Name As String = (Dns.GetHostEntry(Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_HOST")).HostName)

However, this returns the error "No such host is known". Any ideas where I'm going wrong here?
Thanks
