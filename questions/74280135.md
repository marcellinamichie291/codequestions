# System.Runtime.Remoting not present in COM reference pop up

I have just started with .net development. But while working with my first project for remoting I stucked on an error for an import present in my project.
using System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels

Gives an error showing 'The type or namespace name 'Channels' does not exist in the namespace 'System.Runtime.Remoting.' (are you missing an assembly reference?)'
And after searching a lot on web I got solution to add COM reference to the project with dll named System.Runtime.Remoting but on the pop of add reference I couldn't found the dll. Do I have to download the same or any other solution for that?
