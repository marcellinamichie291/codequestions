# IIS URL Rewrite custom module doesn't work when used with ARR

I have developed two custom rewrite modules. This is the first time I am doing custom rewrite modules.
When used in classic URL rewrite engine (IIS Server Win 2019 with latest URL rewrite engine) it works without problems, if there are problems I have some custom logging to solve it.
I now need to use it with ARR (Application Request Routing).
It won't even initialize the custom provider, and when I try a rule with custom provider I just get an error 500.
Failed Request Tracing which is best tool to solve this has no concrete errors about this in log.
Are custom URL rewrite providers supported in combination with ARR ?
