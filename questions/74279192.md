# How to get the correct type of a Typescript function argument based on another argument's generic type?

I tried to find other answers but could not find any solution to this very simple problem so I am sure I am missing something obvious.
I have a function that takes in a generic argument that can be either string or number and based on the type of this argument, the second argument will have a specific type. The code is very simple:

type OptionsNumber = {
  numberProp: number
}

type OptionsString = {
  stringProp: string
}

export const test = <T extends number | string>(
  input: T | undefined | null,
  options?: T extends string
    ? OptionsString
    : T extends number
    ? OptionsNumber 
    : never
): void => {
  if (typeof input === 'number') {
    // I am getting an error below because TypeScript is not able to apply the `OptionsNumber` type
    console.log(options.numberProp)
  }
}

Working code here: https://tsplay.dev/w17rAm
Basically, all I am hoping is that by checking the type of input TypeScript can know that options have the right type (just like in the options conditional type.
What am I missing?
