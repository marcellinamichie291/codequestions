# UICollectionViewLayout set background color to section or group dynamically

I want to be able to set a background color on Section or a Group of my UICollectionViewLayout dynamically, which means that let's say:
I have a json that sending me a list of items and one of them have a background color that I need to apply only on the related section or group in the collection view. I didn't find anything to achieve that except some workarounds but that didn't work for me. Is in 2022 a new way of handling this ?
I already know that we can set background color with decorationItems but you can't really use it dynamically.
    private func generateLayout() -> UICollectionViewLayout {
    let layout = UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout { (sectionIndex: Int,
                                                        layoutEnvironment: NSCollectionLayoutEnvironment)
        -> NSCollectionLayoutSection? in
        let isWideView = layoutEnvironment.container.effectiveContentSize.width > 500
        
        let sectionLayoutKind = Section.allCases[sectionIndex]
        switch (sectionLayoutKind) {
        case .xs:
            return self.xsLayout()
            
        case .s:
            let section = self.mLayout()
            return section
            
        case .m:
            let section = self.mLayout()
            let sectionBackground = NSCollectionLayoutDecorationItem.background(
                elementKind: BackgroundColorGroupView.reuseIdentifer)
            section.decorationItems = [sectionBackground]
            return self.mLayout()
            
        case .l:
            return self.lLayout()
            
        case .xl:
            return self.xLLayout()
        }
    }
    return layout
}
