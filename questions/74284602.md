# How to view all Flutter app cache files and objects?

Listview / PageView Widgets do cache data and I don't know where, as well as Image.network and another bunch of widgets do cache data.
I know that you may clear cache by these methods below :-
and the methods mentioned in this thread
How to clear app cache programmatically on Flutter
   setState(() {
              imageCache.clear();
              imageCache.clearLiveImages();
              PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.clear();
            });

But I'm not sure that I have deleted ALL cached data allover the app,
Are these enough to clear all cached data or there are more ?
and How can you list and view all the cached data that are misteriously hidden somewhere I don't know where !?
please excuse my ignorance
