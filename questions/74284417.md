# typescript type narrowing `data` is not undefined when `error` is undefined

I have the following interface for HTTP response
interface HTTPResponse<T> {
  ok: boolean, 
  error?: HTTPError; 
  data?: T, 
  init: ResponseInit
}

and this type narrowing check
export function isHTTPError(object: any): object is HTTPError {
  return "error" in object && object.ok === false;
}

when I pass a response through the isHTTPError check, typescript can tell if this is an error response and knows that error can't be undefined at this point.
If the response is not an error how to tell typescript that data is definitely present and should not be treated as possibly undefined?

At this moment I am using the following function
export function isHTTPSuccess<T>(object: any): object is T {
  return "data" in object && object.ok === true;
}

but this requires checking the response twice.
