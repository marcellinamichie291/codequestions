# Get all messages in Outlook using Microsoft Graph API

I have a question about Microsoft Graph API for C# code. Is it possible to get all messages which I have in Outlook?
I found a good article, but I'm still not getting an answer to my question. The article:
Get all email message using Microsoft Graph API in c#
Code:
var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId,clientId,clientSecret);
GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential);
var graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(authenticationProvider);
var messages = graphServiceClient.Users["user@domain.com"].Messages.Request().Top(100).GetAsync();

With this code I'm not getting any messages from my inbox. I checked my authorization and it's a right one. I have client_id, clientSecret and tenant_id.
So, maybe it's not possible to use Microsoft Graph to get all email messages in Outlook?
