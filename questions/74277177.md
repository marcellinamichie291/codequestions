# how to perform update slots from 2 sql table?

I am doing a booking cancellation function. I have successfully remove the data in reservation table as shown in the code below. However, I would like to update the status for the timeslots. For the timeslots table, 1 = not available for booking anymore, 0 = available for booking. While the user logs in into the account, they can view the appointment and perform booking cancellation, which is where I am stucked with on updating the timeslots to make it available for booking again.
For the reservations table, its status means visited or not visited, which is not related to this question. However, the reservation table is the table which shows the information to the users to view their appointment history, and here is where the cancellation feature will be provided, using a button.
The problem is that I do not know how to connect between the reservation table and the timeslot table. I need the timeslot table to show the updated status is 0 after cancellation happens for a particular day instead of continue showing 1. Below I will attach the database in SQL. Thanks in advanced.
