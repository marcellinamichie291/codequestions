# Run app on http instead of https using tomcat configuration

I want to run the application on http instead of https. How can I modify server.xml file for that. I tried various solutions mentioned here , but not able to resolve it.
here is server.xml file configuration
<Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
            redirectPort="8443" />

<Connector port="8443"
                     protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
                     maxThreads="150"
                     scheme="https"
                     secure="true"
                     SSLEnabled="true"
                     truststoreFile="/opt/server/conf/tomcat.keystore"
                     truststorePass="pathway"
                     keystoreFile="/opt/server/conf/tomcat.keystore"
                     keystorePass="pathway"
                     clientAuth="true"
                     keyAlias="serveralias"
                     sslProtocol="TLS"/> 



<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" />

FYI: This server.xml file is configured in docker. I am running the app using docker.
