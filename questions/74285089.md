# Lights stop working on only some even when component is the same

I'm trying to make lights in Unity for my house.
I've got 14 lights in my house, however, there is a small problem. This is because the lights are dimmed in some parts of the house and not in others. I have checked that all of the light components are the same (they are), and sometimes I get this flickering thing? I have wondered if it is because something isn't done correctly, like baking the house or whatnot.
Here is the light component:

Here is what the lights look like (they are red because I thought it would be easier to see):

As you can see, the lights just stop working as shown by the line
If anyone can help me that would be great!
