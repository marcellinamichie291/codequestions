# Define and retrieve custom meta information from Apache Camel Route

Is it somehow possible to define meta information in Apache Camel routes, such as:

Which features are enabled
Which properties does the route require
Which impact does enabling feature xyz have
What does the route provide in return

and retrieve it from a route or even a series of routes without executing them?
I'd like to use such properties to dynamically generate a "control dashboard" based on the information the routes expose.
