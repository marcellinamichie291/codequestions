# how to access and print the value of inner index in python list

I have a list of strings i will like to access and print its inner elements as shown below:
mylist = ['apple', 'balls', 'camera', 'dough', 'eleven']
specified_index = random.choices((range(len(mylist))), k=len(mylist))
print("specified_index =", specified_index)
merged_index = [mylist[tt] for tt in specified_index]
print("merged_index =", merged_index)

The result of merged_index keeps printing the words found at specified_index.
Sample Output:
specified_index = [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]
merged_index = ['camera', 'dough', 'eleven', 'apple', 'balls']

What i want instead is to keep printing the corresponding letter of specified_index -not the whole words even if the list is shuffled.
#For example: My preferred output == "mgeaa"
specified_index = [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]
merged_index = ['caMera', 'douGh', 'elevEn', 'Apple', 'bAlls']

Note::: I tried
import more_itertools as mit
merged_list = mit.random_product(mylist)

but it doesn't allow me to maintain same specified_index whenever mylist is shuffled
#Other answers i found does not really solve this.
