# Using X-tabs with more than 2 variables

I need some help using xtabs
When using xtabs for two variables, (species and site) I get the desired output. But, when I try to add another variable, (example2) xtabs seems to ignore the added variable and it produces the same output as example1. Is it possible to add another variable with xtabs? Or am I limited to just two? Any help would be really appreciated.
**extra info (I'm trying to make species accumulation curves using the inext package. I then want to use a facet_wrap to view individual graphs for each of my sites. So far, I am only able to produce a graph that shows all the treatments for all the sites combined. However, I am unable to facet_wrap by site, since xtabs won't let me add in the extra variable. I could do this manually by subsetting by site and then using xtabs, but I rather not do this if I can use a workaround)
data_matrix<-xtabs(Row1~Species+Site,data=df) #example1

data_matrix<-xtabs(Row1~Species+Site+Treatment,data=df) #example2
