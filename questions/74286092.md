# VBA macro removing rows with 3 conditions

I'm trying to write a macro that removes rows with the condition that the string in the cells in column A contains "--" or "-4" or "" (empty). I'd do it with a normal filter, but that gives me max 2 conditions.
Sub Delete_Rows()
Dim cell As Range
For Each cell In Range("A:A")
If cell.Value = "*--*" Or cell.Value = "*-4*" Then
cell.EntireRow.Delete
End If
Next cell
End Sub

What am I doing wrong?
