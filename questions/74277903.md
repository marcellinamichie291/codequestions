# How to change, customize, Mongoose default _id property?

I have the following schema:
const { ObjectId } = Schema.Types

const Account = new Schema({
    name:           { type: String, required: true },
    accountId:      { type: String, required: true },
    piracicaba:     [{ type: ObjectId, ref: 'Piracicaba'}]
})

I know that by default MongoDB creates an _id property, but I would like to make accountId my default ID instead. Also, I would like to change that default generated string to a custom one.
How could I do that?
I have tried to change the accountId type to ObjectId:
const { ObjectId } = Schema.Types

const Account = new Schema({
    name:           { type: String, required: true },
    accountId:      { type: ObjectId },
    piracicaba:     [{ type: ObjectId, ref: 'Piracicaba'}]
})

But then when I try to store my customized ID mongoose throws BSONTypeError: Argument passed in must be a string of 12 bytes or a string of 24 hex characters or an integer.
My customized ID is from Oracle Cloud Account and it looks like this: ocid1.test.oc1..<unique_ID>EXAMPLE-compartmentId-Value
