# running sudo -i command in bash script?

I was making setup script for me
where I have to run
sudo -i

then
echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'

I don't know if I can even use this echo on already open sudo su
I check some old query but most not able to find sudo -i
any help
