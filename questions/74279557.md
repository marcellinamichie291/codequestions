# Set quantity of different values

I'm kinda fresh in SQL and I really need help :)
I have a code:
select *
from table1
where action_code_is in ('pink', 'yellow', 'blue', 'green') 
AND group = 'colors'

What I want to filter is only values in action_code_is (I have thousands) which I wrote. The main thing is that I want to have only 4 pink values, 5 yellow, 6 blue and 3 green.
Could someone help me? I'm not sure how to see only a set quantity of actions not all values from table.
