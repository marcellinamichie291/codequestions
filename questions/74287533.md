# Euclidean Division in VBScript to convert decimal to binary

I just started out with VBS and I need to convert Decimal Numbers (that are randomly generated) to Binary so I can save them in a file.
When converting Decimal to binary on Paper I use Euclidean Division. Can I program this in VBScript?
