I have a wordpress page with an image that doesn't fill the whole page and a caption underneath it. But the caption won't align in the center of the image. Instead it aligns in the center of the whole page.
The picture has the following html:
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="xyz" alt="" class="wp-image-3183" width="768" height="512"/><figcaption>Foto: xyz.com</figcaption></figure>
and I used
.wp-block-image figcaption { text-align: center; }
in the additional CSS section and I tried left, and right as well. Those too work only on whole page not under the picture.
Please let me know if you need further information.
Thank you in advance!
