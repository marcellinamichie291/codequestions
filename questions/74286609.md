# So I've got a school project to make a German grammar-help-tool using c#

I recently started learning c# So I got a school assignment to make a German grammar-help-tool. It's a group assignment my task is:
The application loads prefabricated sentences from a file, and randomly makes small changes to these sentences. For example, commas can be deleted, ies can be replaced by i, s can be replaced by ss, and so on. The user is presented with the changed sentence, and it is up to him to find the error.
I tried using the string. Replace and streamReader/Writer, but it didn't work.
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(File.OpenRead(@"C:\Users\kamil\OneDrive\Dokumente\test grammatik.txt"));
string fileContent = reader.ReadToEnd();
reader.Close();
fileContent = fileContent.Replace("tier", "aff");

StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(File.OpenWrite("C:\test grammatik.txt"));
writer.Write(fileContent);
writer.Close();

the sentance in the txt file is: "Ein grosses Tier" and I wanted to replace the "Tier" with "Aff" and it's what i expected and I got:

System.IO.IOException: 'The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. : 'C:\Users\kamil\source\repos\test\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\ est grammatik.txt''

in the Line:
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(File.OpenWrite("C:\test grammatik.txt"));
