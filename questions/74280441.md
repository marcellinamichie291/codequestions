# How to get rid of the window left behind after a HoloLens2 process is killed?

This is a question for HoloLens2.
After I kill an app (programmatically), frequently there is an empty window left behind. See attached picture.
Is there a way not to have this window or kill it too?
I am using "/api/taskmanager/app (DELETE)" from Device portal API reference.
Thanks,
