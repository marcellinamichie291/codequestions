# Is there a problem with using Angular, nginx(server) and ingress with rewrite

This can be a reference
Can we change the URL route in between ingress and service?
  metadata:
  name: ingress-srv
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 20m

spec:
  rules:
     - host: www.mysite.com  
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /custom(/|$)(.*)
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: image-service
                    port:
                      number: 80 
              - path: / 
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: frontend-service
                    port:
                      number: 80

Both of my services only work on /
What rewrite does(according to my understanding) is, it strips off the /custom before sending it to the service, so basically the service sees /
www.mysite.com/custom => works
But, it's not working with my frontend-service (angular app with nginx)
www.mysite.com => does not work (angular app)
Instead I see this error:

Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.

My applications works fine (except for image-service) if I remove the

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2

I am using HashlocationStrategy, <base href=".">
Why is this happening? What should I change for rewrite to work?
