# If null use other variable in one line in PHP

Is there in PHP something similar to JavaScript's:
alert(test || 'Hello');

So, when test is undefined or null we'll see Hello, otherwise - we'll see the value of test.
I tried similar syntax in PHP but it doesn't seem to be working right... Also I've got no idea how to google this problem..
thanks
Edit
I should probably add that I wanted to use it inside an array:
$arr = array($one || 'one?', $two || 'two?'); //This is wrong

But indeed, I can use the inline '? :' if statement here as well, thanks.
$arr = array(is_null($one) ? "one?" : $one, is_null($two) ? "two ?" : $two); //OK
