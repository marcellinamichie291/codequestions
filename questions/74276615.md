# Adding binary scores to a table, linked to pat_no and timestamp

I have two df's with the same patient numbers (pat_no).

DF1 contains pat_no, logging_timestamp, logs
DF2 contains pat_no, scoring_timestamp, scores

I want to add the scores to the first DF, sorted by pat_no and timestamp.
The two timestamp columns are different, but I want to see what the scores were at certain logging moments. I wat thinking of using merge_asof() and tolerance=pd.Timedelta(hours=2) for when the timestamps don't match exactly.
This is what I tried:
data = df1.merge(df2, on = ['pat_no', scoring_timestamp'], suffixes=('_left', '_right))
How do I do this?
Thanks in advance!
