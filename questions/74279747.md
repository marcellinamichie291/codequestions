I have a host pc connected to a kvm over ip swithch. Both the host pc and the kvm over ip switch have ethernet connections, no wifi. When I access the host pc from a remote pc via vnc viewer, the connection is very very slow. I have tried a few diff networks on the remote pc. Same result. How can I troubleshoot this issue. Thank you.
