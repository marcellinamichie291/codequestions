# Can we generate push notification using onPressed in Flutter (using Firebase)?

I know that we can use firebase cloud messaging and from the firebase console only we can generate notifications for flutter app (after we setup up everything in the app
). But is there any way by which I can generate notification on press of a button. For e.g. The admin of the app adds a new event, as soon as he/she presses [Add Event] button, a notification gets generated for each user (using firebase) that a new event has been added? How can this be achieved?
