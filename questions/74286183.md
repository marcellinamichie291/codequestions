# Unresolved external linker error in C++Builder

I am new to C++ Builder and am translating a Delphi project into C++. I have translated some of the Delphi code into C++ and it compiles fine in C++ Builder BUT I get the error
Unresolved external ColorClasses::TColorList:: referenced from ...
when I use the TColorList constructor in my main form in this way:
  ```
  ColorClasses::TColorList *cl;

  cl = new ColorClasses::TColorList();
  ```

The TColorList constructor is defined as follows in file "ColorClasses.cpp":
__fastcall ColorClasses::TColorList::TColorList() : TColorClass()
{
  fcolor_list = new TList();
}

The TColorList class is declared as follows in file "ColorClasses.h":
class DELPHICLASS TColorList;

class PASCALIMPLEMENTATION TColorList : public TColorClass
{
private:
  TList* fcolor_list;

public:
  __fastcall TColorList();
  virtual __fastcall ~TColorList();
};

I have searched the stack overflow site for similar questions relevant to C++ Builder but I can't find one specific to my problem.
