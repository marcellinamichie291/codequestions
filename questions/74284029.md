# iOS For AVAssetReader, whether copyNextSampleBuffer can read video frames at specified intervals?

I am trying to write a custom iOS video player app. The principle is to read and render images to the screen frame by frame through AVAssetReader. Now I want to realize the function of doubling video playback, such as playing videos at 10x or 20x speed. If I'm using the copyNextSampleBuffer method to read a video frame by frame, I seem to have to execute this function several times in a row, which is time-consuming and tends to stall. I wonder if there is a more efficient way to read a video frame, for example, if I can set the interval between reading a video frame, Read it every 10 frames or 20 frames. Can anyone help me? Thank you very much
I tried to perform copyNextSampleBuffer several times in a row and then take a frame to render, but in my tests this was inefficient and time-consuming
