# What would be the best way to sort these into columns?

I want all the red boxes in the right side, and the green ones on the left.
The color is based on the divs having different classes based on a boolean value.
I have obtained how to sort them, but i want them to ignore the rows, so they're as close togehter as possible.
Check it here!
Thanks in advance!
