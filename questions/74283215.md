I am defining a structure and accessing its fields through a pointer. I am trying a scanf statement to input the fields using a pointer. I dont get any syntax errors but unable to achieve my objective.I am trying to populate a queue of structures.I am a novice to C.
void enque(struct queue* q) {
  if(isempty(q)==1){
    q->front+=1;
    q->rear+=1;
    scanf("%19s",E->Dept);
    scanf("%d", &E->Id)
    scanf("%19s",E->Name)
    q->arr[q->rear]=*E;

I expected to enter the structure fields using a pointer from the console. I type in the first field and the program terminates instead of accepting and assigning the successive fields/
