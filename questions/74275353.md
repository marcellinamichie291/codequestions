# How to invert a matrix with transfer functions in python?

I know that in matlab I can do the following:
s = tf('s')
G11 = (s + 1)/(s + 2)
G12 = 1/(2*s + 1)
G21 = 1/(3*s + 1)
G22 = 1/(4*s + 1)

A = [G11 G12; G21, G22]
Ai = inv(A)
bode(A)

and it will work just fine. In python, I tried to do something similar:
import control as co
import numpy as np

s = co.tf('s')
G11 = (s + 1)/(s + 2)
G12 = 1/(2*s + 1)
G21 = 1/(3*s + 1)
G22 = 1/(4*s + 1)

A = np.array([[G11, G12], [G21, G22]])
Ai = np.linalg.inv(A)
co.bode(A)

But this doesnt work - numpy doesnt know how to invert this matrix.
Is there a good way to do this in python? I know that I can use scipy with s being a symbol, but I think that doesnt help me when using the others tools in the control toolbox.
