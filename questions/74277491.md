# How to find out that a Windows program has stopped working / C#

I am working on a C# application that can be configured to supervise other programs so that if they become unresponsive, they will automatically be killed and then restarted. This is done by examining the processes' (System.Diagnostics.Process) values and observing unresponsive programs seems to work  ok. However, there is a quite common situation where Windows decides that a program has stopped working and Windows waits for user input to close the program. Windows informs this by a pop-up message window with the following information:
"Program X has stopped working
A Problem caused the program to stop working correctly.
Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available"
BUTTON : Close program
In this scenario the program is not yet deemed unresponsive, so the supervising program does not detect this situation currently.
My question is whether there is some process value or some other way that could be used to detect this situation? I have tried to locate a process value corresponding to this scenario, but have been unable to find it so far.
I would appreciate your assistance in solving this problem very much.
