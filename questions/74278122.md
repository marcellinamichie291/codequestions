# Tensorflow Datasets with different structure Merging to Batch Merged Dataset

**
`
I have 2 TensorFlow datasets.  One dataset is 19 million and other one is 24000. I want to create 19million * 24000 type input feature matrix.  Can I achieve it using TensorFlow dataset operation.
Currently I am trying to merge the datasets using pandas as follows. But I get memory error in AWS Sage maker pipeline and it needs 2.74TiB.  So I decided to batch inferencing After converting my 2 users_df and items_df data frames to TensorFlow datasets!
Is there any way to do this pandas merge operation in tensorflow datasets?`
