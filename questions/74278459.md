# Apply a different dataset on REBEL module

I am trying to apply a different training/testing dataset on the REBEL module, please see the following page. https://github.com/Babelscape/rebel
If I understand it correctly, the following module should be able to provide a specific dataset for the module; https://github.com/Babelscape/crocodile. Does anyone know how this can effectively be applied?
Kind regards
