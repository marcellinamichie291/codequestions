# AWS Ruby lambda namespaced handler setting in AWS CDK

I have a question about lambda function handler in Ruby https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/ruby-handler.html. They say that you can namespace your function logic in a modules and class, like so:
module LambdaFunctions
  class ApiHandler
    def self.process(event:,context:)
      "Hello!"
    end
  end
end

and then in CDK the handler setting would be source.LambdaFunctions::Handler.process
const apiProxyLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'apiProxyLambda', {
 runtime: lambda.Runtime.RUBY_2_7,
 handler: 'source.LambdaFunctions::Handler.process',
});

What if I wanted to define the entry point to ApiHandler#process class instance method, like so?
module LambdaFunctions
  class ApiHandler
    def process(event:,context:)
      do_some_stuff
    end
  
    private
    
    def do_some_stuff
      ...
    end
  end
end

I suspect that the correct reference to the class instance method in this case would be source.LambdaFunctions::Handler#process. Does anyone know if this is correct? If this is possible, the my question is, how would lambda 'know' that it needs to instantiate my class first
handler = LambdaFunctions::ApiHandler.new

and then call handler.process(event: event, context: context)?
