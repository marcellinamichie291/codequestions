# Display in Woocommerce the product price per gram on Shop page and singel view

I'm currently trying to find a solution how to automatically display the gram price on the Woocommerce Shop Page and on the single product view below the regular price. I would like to do this without an additional plugin. Unfortunately, I'm still a newbie when it comes to woocommerce costumizations.
Unfortunately I've only found this post about it so far.
Can someone briefly explain to me how I could achieve this?
Thank you very much
<?php 
global $product; 

if ( ! is_a( $product, 'WC_Product' ) ) {
    $product = wc_get_product( get_the_ID() );
}

$price  = wc_get_price_including_tax( $product );
$weight = $product->get_weight();

if( $product->has_weight() ) {
    // echo __("Weight") . ': ' . wc_format_weight( $weight ) . '<br>'; // Uncomment if needed
    echo wc_price( $price / $weight ) . ' ' . __("per gram");
}
?>
