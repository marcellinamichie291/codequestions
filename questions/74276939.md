# bat file but get the credentials from a .ini file or some other kind of file

I have a batch file which will open a website within chrome.exe, and automatically log me in. However I want my credentials to be taken from a separate file, not from the batch file itself.
I have tried to make a data.ini file, but I have no clue of how I can make my batch file read the .ini file and get the credentials from it.
