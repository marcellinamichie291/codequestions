# Why does pnpm seem to detect an extra workspace?

I have set up a new project with pnpm and I'm unsure about some of the output I'm seeing when I run recursive commands. Specifically, it seems like pnpm is detecting 3 workspaces when I expect there should only be 2.
The project structure looks like this:
| workbooks/
|-- workbook-one/
|---- package.json
|-- workbook-two/
|---- package.json
|
| package.json
| pnpm-workspace.yaml

The pnpm-workspace.yaml file is:
packages:
  - "workbooks/*"

I have a build command in the top-level package.json like so:
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "project:deploy": "pnpm -r --if-present --workspace-concurrency=1 project:deploy"
  }
  ...
}

Each of the two workspaces has a project:deploy script. However, when I run pnpm project:deploy I see this in the output:
> pnpm -r --if-present --workspace-concurrency=1 project:deploy

Scope: 2 of 3 workspace projects

Why is the scope "2 of 3", rather than "2 of 2"?
