I have a list I created through a process that looks like this (so that I could pull from tidycensus):
dv_acs = c(
  hus          = "B25002_001", 
  husocc       = "B25002_002", 
  husvac       = "B17001_002"
)

I want to know if I can turn that into a data.frame. When I try to ask it to be a data.frame by:
out <- data.frame(dv_acs)

Then I get this:
           dv_acs
hus    B25002_001
husocc B25002_002
husvac B17001_002

Where the lefthand names replace what is normally 1:n but is not, in itself, a column of variables (data is noted as 3 obs of 1 variable).
