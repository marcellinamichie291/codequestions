# Xcode 14 No Platform For watch Although I Downloaded WatchOS 9.0 Simulator Now Redownload it Gives Error Duplicated

My Xcode 14.01 was working fine and Run On the iOS And WatchOS Perfectly then one time I Notice it give me error with new build Saying No WatchOS Platform and I'm Sure I Already Download it.
So I go To Settings and try to download it again then An Error Of Duplicated was there , But I Notice That My WatchOS Platform Is Already There With Same Size With word beside it saying On Disk, But Why its Not Working.
Here is what I see In Menu Xcode -> Settings -> Platform

So Should I Remove the One There And Re Download again In fact It Is Quite Much To Download 3.6 GB Every time Or Should I Re Install The Xcode 14.01 Again
My System Is like that
MacOS : Ventura macOS 14.0
MacBook Air M1 2020
