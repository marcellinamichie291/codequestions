# pre-select which column to be chosen for generating plots in shiny

I'm building a shiny app, where the user, uploads a dataset and the app directly generates several plots since the columns are pre-chosen in the app, like the example below with "TIME" and "DV". However, I would like to modify the code so that the app can still generate plots automatically, even if the uploaded dataset has different column names, so for instance, the app should always choose column 2 and column 3, no matter the name of them if its "time_min", "TIME_h"  etc. I tried with data[[2]], data[[3]] but didn't work
sim_st1<-reactive({
  graph_st <- ggplot() +
    geom_point(data = data(), aes(.data[["TIME"]], .data[["DV"]] *1000, colour = factor(SIM)), size=1) +
    
    labs(x="Time (h)", y="Conc. (ng/ml)", color="SIM", fill=NULL, shape=NULL) +
    
    scale_y_log10() +
    
    theme_bw()
  
  
  graph_st
  
})
