# MonkeyType: No traces found for module src.projectname.__main__

Context
While trying to generate type hints for all python files in some project named projectname, I am experiencing some difficulties applying the stubs. The project directory is:
projectname/
|-- src/
|   |-- projectname/__main__.py
|   |-- projectname/some_folder/some_script.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- projectname/test_something.py
|   |-- projectname/another_folder/test_another_thing.py
|
|-- setup.py
|-- README.md

The main code is executed with:
python -m src.projectname

and the tests are executed with:
python -m pytest

Output
Based on this issue, I tried running:
monkeytype run src/snncompare/__main__.py

Which generates the monkeytype.sqlite3 file in the root directory of the project. However, when I try to apply the generated type hints with:
monkeytype stub src.snncompare.__main__.py
monkeytype apply src.snncompare.__main__.py

or:
monkeytype stub src.snncompare.__main__
monkeytype apply src.snncompare.__main__

I get:
No traces found for module src.projectname.__main__
No traces found for module src.projectname.__main__.py

respectively. And for:
monkeytype apply src.snncompare

It says:

No traces found for module src.snncompare

Question
How can I apply the generated stubs to all the (touched) .py files in the project?
