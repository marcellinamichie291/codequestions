# spring junit test data preparrer class access repositories trough field

I have simple class annotated with @Component and injected repositories like
@Component
class TestsDataPreparer(
    private val carRepository: CarRepository
) {

fun withCar(builder: Car.() -> Unit = {}): Car {
    return carRepository.save(
        Car(
            name = builder.name!!
        )
    )
}

}

which is clear..
But i wonder if it would be ok to do something like this, or if it is considered as anti-pattern.
@Component
class TestsDataPreparer(
    val carRepository: CarRepository
) {

fun withCar(builder: Car.() -> Unit = {}): Car {
    return carRepository.save(
        Car(
            name = builder.name!!
        )
    )
}

}

@Test
fun testCar() {
   testsDataPreparer.withCar{this.name="Super-cool-car!"}
   assertThat(testsDataPreparer.carRepository.findAll()).hasSize(1)
}

So the question is if it is okay to not inject repository in test class itself, but reuse it from TestsDataPreparer class
