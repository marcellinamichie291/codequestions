# How are JavaScript arrays represented in physical memory?

It is my understanding that I can store mixed data in a JavaScript array, as well as change any element in the array to some other type. How does the interpreter keep track of what place in physical memory any element is at. Also how is the overwriting of the data in the next element prevented if I change an element to a larger data type.
I assume that arrays only store references to actual objects, and primitives are wrapped behind the scenes when placed in arrays.
Assuming this is the case, If I have a different handle on the primitive variable and change the value stored in the array is synchronicity maintained?
I know I probably already answered my own question, but I don't know for sure and I can't find any information on the matter.
