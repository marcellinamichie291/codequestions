I am using try-except to see if the model file exists, if exists, then load the file, otherwise go to except to create a new model.
Now inside try statement, I added if-else to change filename if re-train Model='yes' such that the modified filename doesn't exists so I expect it will go to except to create a new model. Basically to re-train the model.
Now it is not working. it always go to except directly. I added print('symbol_1=',symbol_1) and this print() never run. why? Thanks for your help.
    print('re-train Model=',re_train_ML)
    try:
        if 'yes' in re_train_ML.lower(): 
            symbol_1=symbol+'_temp' # create a wrong file name in order to make model not found so we can re-train the model
        else:
            symbol_1=symbol.copy()
        print('symbol_1=',symbol_1)
        svc = load(os.path.join(path,f"Models/{symbol_1}_SVC_cla.joblib"))
        print('Found the ML Model, and Loaded it')
    except:
        # Initialize the class
        svc = SVC()
