# ethers.js queryFilter event throws errors

I am able to query some events from my smart contract like this:
const eventFilter = contract.contract.filters.MyEvent();
const theEvents = await contract.contract.queryFilter(eventFilter);
console.log(theEvents);

It works and fetches all the events once.
However after a bit it tries to fetch again automatically (polling) and it throws this same error a bunch of times:
Error: missing response (requestBody="{\"method\":\"eth_getLogs\",\"params\":[{\"fromBlock\":\"0x0\",\"toBlock\":\"latest\",\"address\":"0xMY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS........",.....

Not sure what the issue is... any help would be greatly appreciated.
