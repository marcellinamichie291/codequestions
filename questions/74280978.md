# is there anyway to achieve the mvc pattern in flutter developpment without using the getx package

is there any way to achieve a better approach for the MVC, Model-View-Pattern architecture pattern, without using the Getx flutter package?
since the Getx package is just a lot, and I don(t want to use it's other features but the state management
is there any packages or some ways that help manage my app state with MVC
any information are welcome
