# Make a condition if a polygon contains a point

I need to set up a condition using shapely that accuses whether or not a point belongs to a polygon.
If the value is true, a message "point belongs to polygon" should be displayed. If the point does not belong, then the message "the point does not belong to the polygon" should be displayed.
Also, if the point belongs to the polygon, it must be shown which polygon the point belongs to.

I tried to set up a condition using the "if" inside the "for" but it didn't work.
