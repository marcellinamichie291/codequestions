# SQL Ignoring duplicate values if ID difference larger than

Lets say I have a simple table:
ID value
1   15
2   30
3   **10**
4   **10**
5   16
6   20
7   **15**
8   **15**
9   40
10  70
11  **50**
12  **50**
13  19
14  11
15  3

My select should ignore consecutive double values. I know how to do that - I am using lead function
But this eliminates all consecutive duplicates.
SELECT   [DetectorParameterValue] 
FROM  (
   SELECT lead(DetectorParameterValue,1) over (partition by runid order by runtime) AS prev_DetectorParameterValue 
   FROM table_Detector 
   WHERE  RunID = @run_id
) AS [InnerDetector] 
WHERE (prev_DetectorParameterValue is null or or prev_DetectorParameterValue <> DetectorParameterValue

But it should ignore them only if ID diff is more than 5.
So my select should be
ID Value
1   15
2   30
3   10
5   16
6   20
7   15
8   15
9   40
10  70
11  50
13  19
14  11
15  3

ID 4 and 12 should be ignored but ID 8 should not because ID 8 - ID 4 is not > 5.
Is there a way to do this?
Thanks in advance.
