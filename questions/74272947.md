# Can a local variable's memory be accessed outside its scope?

I have the following code.
#include <iostream>

int * foo()
{
    int a = 5;
    return &a;
}

int main()
{
    int* p = foo();
    std::cout << *p;
    *p = 8;
    std::cout << *p;
}

And the code is just running with no runtime exceptions!
The output was 58
How can it be? Isn't the memory of a local variable inaccessible outside its function?
