# How to use VBA to copy the content of specific filtered colums from one excel sheet into another?

I have an Excel Sheet with many columns, where the content of each column can be filtered. For a named subset of these columns I need to copy their filtered content into another sheet and on the way change the name of these columns. So if SheetA has columns named "C1", "C2", ..., "C9", I want to copy the filtered contents of "C2", "C5" and "C8", into SheetB, and where the copied colums get renamed to "Cn1", "Cn2" and "Cn3".
I appreciate any suggestions!
