# Can I intercept HTTP requests that are coming for another application and port using python

I am currently thinking on a project that automatically executes defensive actions such as adding the IP of a DoS attacker to iptables list to drop their requests permanently.
My question is can I intercept the HTTP requests that are coming for another application, using python? For example, can I count how many times an Apache server running on port 80, recieved a HTTP POST request and extract its sender etc.
I tried looking into requests documentation but couldn't find anything relevant.
