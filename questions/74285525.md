# How to extract data of work items in Azure Devops to Excel

I have a list of work items which contain some data in Description, Acceptance Criteria and Test steps. Is there a way I can extract that data and place it in an Excel spreadsheet ?
I installed Azure DevOps Office integration 2019 and grouped the work items using query. Then when I click on export to Excel, I get the data about the grouped work items, like Assigned to, work item type etc.
What I want instead is the data in those work items.
