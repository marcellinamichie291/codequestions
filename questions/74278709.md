# How to specify field path when excluding firestore indexes

I'm confused what exactly I should specify as the 'field path' when excluding the indexes for this document.  I'm hitting the 40k limit for the array, I don't need to ever query it, this is used solely to sync data into bigquery and the data is processed there.  For collection id i put in g-views but not sure what to specify in Field path when adding the exemption.
views_arr = [{id: 'abc', views: 20}, {...}, ...];
await db.collection('g-views').doc(dtISOString).set({'views': views_arr});
