# Assigning value in C macro

Is it ok to assign a value in a C macro (i.e. have an lvalue in a macro)? For example, I would like to set a bit of a number to 1 based on the specified bit position. Is it ok to do this:
#define SET_BIT(data, pos)  ((data) |= (1U << (pos)))

I've tested this and it works, but I feel like I'm walking on thin ice here and if I get used to macros like this, I would eventually run into problems.
