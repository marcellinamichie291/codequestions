# Can't import 1 column into a mysql database table successfully

Yesterday I tried all day to import a CSV containing the data for 1 column of a mssql DB table. I was using the following:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/home/myinfotel/dump_new/NewsItems_Story.csv' 
INTO TABLE NewsItems 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
(Story);

However, every time I run this (and any other variation including FIELDS TERMINATED BY and ENCLOSED BY parameters) I get a result similar to Query OK, 0 rows affected, 65535 warnings (47.509 sec) Records: 742447  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 742447  Warnings: 831555  in the query output. But there should be 742,447 rows affected, as that is the number of rows existing in the csv. The data I'm importing takes the following format:
"<p>long_article_text<p>"
"<p>long_article_text2<p>"
"<p>long_article_text3<p>"
...

Why would the above LOAD DATA statement not import this correctly? All it needs to do is read the .csv line by line and import it row by row in the database.
Btw, I have already tried using FIELDS TERMINATED BY '' ENCLOSED BY '"' within the statement.
