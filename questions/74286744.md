# Getting the following error in dropwizard version 2.0.19

I am getting the following error in dropwizard version 2.0.19:
java.lang.AbstractMethodError
    at io.dropwizard.logging.DefaultLoggingFactory.configure(DefaultLoggingFactory.java:170)
    at io.dropwizard.cli.ConfiguredCommand.run(ConfiguredCommand.java:94)
    at io.dropwizard.cli.Cli.run(Cli.java:78)
    at io.dropwizard.Application.run(Application.java:94)
    at com.helloWorld.main(HelloWorldApplication.java:100)

The DefaultLoggingFactory comes only from dropwizard-logging 2.0.19 and there are no conflicting versions for the same.
Can somebody help in pointing out the issue?
I tried checking for conflicting versions but none were present
