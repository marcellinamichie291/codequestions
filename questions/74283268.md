# Ubuntu 22.04 - Http Method PUT not working

Trying to setup a fresh install of ubuntu 22.04 with the ability to use the GET and PUT method.
I am trying to backup some Avaya phones to the server but I keep getting 405 errors when attempting to PUT.
I created a directory in the /var/www/html/PhoneBackup as well and gave it 777 permissions just to be sure it was not a permission issue as well.
Error
"PUT /PhoneBackup/10010_96xxdata.txt HTTP/1.1" 405 521 "-" "AVAYA/SPICE/v6.8+(9608)/Std/05"

I have tried various articles to no avail.
I was told this would work but unable to get it to work so far.
Add this to the config in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
                <Location /var/www/html/PhoneBackup>
                        AllowMethods GET PUT
                </Location>

then run the command
a2enmod allowmethods

This alone does not seem to work for me.
Any suggestions on how I can get PUT to work on a fresh ubuntu 22.04 working would be apprecaiated.
