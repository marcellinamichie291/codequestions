# How can I make a button, like a target, move in a set div when it is clicked

I am making a basic aim trainer game. I have a gameboard which is just a div with a range and a target icon which is really just a button. I want the button to move inside the range every time it is clicked.
this is my code for the gameboard and target


function targetClicked() {
    score++;
    document.getElementById("scoreLabel").innerHTML = score;

    moveTarget();
}

function moveTarget() {

}
#gameboard {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 50px;

    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
    background-color: darkgray;

}

#target {
    width: 75px;
    height: 75px;

    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    margin-right: -50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, 50%);
}
<div id="gameboard">
  <input hidden type="image" src="target.png" id="target" onclick="targetClicked()">
</div>



everything else such as the countdown timer and score counter work. (not shown here) I even got the gameboard and everything to dissapear when the counter reaches 0, but I don't actually know how to move the target everytime it is clicked.
Can I used something like this and inside the moveTarget function adjust the property of the buttons location?
Is there a better way to go about it or can I simply make the button move its position when its clicked?
