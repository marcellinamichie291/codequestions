# R Shiny changing variable types

does anyone know how to show one plot with a variable as a continuous variable, and then to convert that variable into a categorical variable to show a different kind of plot in R shiny.
I'm trying to do this with mt cars data
I also wanted to add a file input widget so the user can input the data
