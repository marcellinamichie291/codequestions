# pandas - create sparse matrix for collaborative filtering

I have a pandas dataframe like this:




user_id
music_id
rating




A
a
5


B
a
3




and I would like to create a sparse matrix from it, putting music_id as column and user_id as a row like this:
->





a
b




A
5



B
3





what would be the way to achieve it by using pandas or numpy for this task?
