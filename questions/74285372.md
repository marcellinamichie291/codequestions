# Terraform SSM module - ignore existing keys if value is passed is null

I'm a bit new to this so I apologize if it's basic.
We have an AWS parameters store managed by terraform.
we use a model for it:
the values of the keys are not stored and each time we do terraform apply we need to enter them manually.
suppose id like to add a new key, id need to edit the tf files to add another key and when i got terraform apply i need to re enter all the values of existing keys and then enter the value for the new key.
Im looking for a way to add to terraform another key, when ill terraform apply, i want terraform to see that only new key is added so all the current existing key are not to be modified. i was thinking about passing null to the variable of the existings keys and then terraform see it is null it will disregard the parameters store and wont touch it.

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "default" {
  count           = var.enabled ? 1 : 0
  name            = "${module.label.id}-parameter"
  type            = var.type
  value           = var.value
  description     = var.description
  tier            = var.tier
  key_id          = var.key_id
  overwrite       = var.overwrite
  allowed_pattern = var.allowed_pattern
  
}


This is the module iâ€™m using.
