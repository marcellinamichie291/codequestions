# Mapbox Unity Android Build No Map Seen

I am using the built in example scene of the "AstronautGame". Under the locationprovider gameobject I am enabling only the AndroidDevice so that I use the "LocationDeviceProvideAndroidNative".
I published the app into Android.
I dont see the map at all.
I have made sure that I have clicked on "Initalize on start".
I also ensured that the build on Android has no other errors.
In the build options i have made sure to use Minimum API level to 24.
Everything works well in Unity editor.
Please can someone give me some directions on what is going wrong.
