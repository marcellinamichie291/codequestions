# Before insert trigger doesn't change column value

I have this simple trigger, which should change the data before insert.
CREATE OR REPLACE function product_fts_create_trg() returns TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
        new.name := 'example';
        return new;
    end
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER "product_fts_create_trigger" BEFORE INSERT ON "productmodel" FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE procedure product_fts_create_trg();


But it doesn't change column value. I thought, that this trigger doesn't processed, but if i change new.name to null (this column has a not null constraint), i got a error, which indicates, that trigger are works.
I use Tortoise ORM with sql query down below (i guess that this didn't ruin trigger, but mb it will be useful for discussion)
INSERT INTO "productmodel" ("id","created_at","modified_at","deleted","deleted_at","fts","name","short_description","long_description","price","old_price","currency","status","weight","length","width","height","count_available","address","text_verification","product_verified","delivery_types","delivery_payed_by","user_id","video_id","video_verification_id") VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10,$11,$12,$13,$14,$15,$16,$17,$18,$19,$20,$21,$22,$23,$24,$25,$26): ['41ab62f0-1cab-47b5-a360-fcc9fbaf3b69', datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 1, 9, 39, 33, 360691, tzinfo=<UTC>), datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 1, 9, 39, 33, 360713, tzinfo=<UTC>), False, None, None, 'Iphone 20', None, None, 100.0, 100.0, 'rub', 'review', None, None, None, None, 0, None, None, False, '["pickpoint"]', 'self-delivery', 3, None, None]

Very interesting that I have BEFORE UPDATE trigger and it works.
create function product_fts_trg() returns trigger
    language plpgsql
as
$$
    BEGIN
        if old.name <> new.name or old.short_description <> new.short_description or old.long_description <> new.long_description
            then new.fts := 'example';
        end if;
        RETURN new;
    end
$$;

alter function product_fts_trg() owner to vlad;
