# Xcode 14 and iOS 5.5 simulators

After updating to Xcode 14 with iOS 16, I'm not seeing any 5.5 devices - makes sense, as Xcode simulators only seem to support one iOS, and none of the 5.5 devices (for instance iPhone 8 Plus) run iOS 16.
However, 5.5 screenshots are still mandatory for the App store. So how do I create these screenshots? The solutions I can think of are these

Using physical 5.5 device like iPhone 8 Plus (I don't have one)
Downgrade Xcode to version 13 in order to support iOS 15. I would very much like to avoid this, besides some of my Mac setup is Virtual and I am not in control of the Xcode version)
