# How to declare variables from an input() with different class ( int and str)

iLig1, iCol1 , iLig2 , iCol2 , carac = map(int, input ().split ())

hello I try to get this ligne of input in my code right, I get 5 variables from an input that look like this:
1 12 7 14 u

how can I declare the last one as a str properly,
I tried to consider them all as str and convert the 4 first as int but I cannot interpret str as int (you know..)
Thank you for your help !
