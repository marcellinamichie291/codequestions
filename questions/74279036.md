# What is the difference between .iloc[0:1] and .iloc[0] in Pandas? Is 1 Exclusive or Inclusive?

When I execute some function with df.iloc[0:1] it shows...
Expected first_row to have type <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'> but had type <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
But same function, with df.iloc[0] it gives me the output in series...
Please give me a explanation. Why two different outcomes?
