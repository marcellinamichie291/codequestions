# Deploying kafka bridge with authentication

I'm trying to deploy kafka bridge with authentication type scram-sha-512, i have used below code . but in this case pods are not coming up .In events I can see "No matching POD found ".
then i tried with authentication type TLS , that is working fine, kafka bridge getting deployed but when I tried to connect using  external endpoint of this kafka bridge its not asking for any certificate .
authentication type : scram-sha-512
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: bridge-dep-tls
spec:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapServers: xx.xx.xx.xx:31002
  tls:
    trustedCertificates:
      - secretName: kafka-cluster-cluster-ca-cert
        certificate: ca.crt
  authentication:
    type: scram-sha-512
    username: adminuser
    passwordSecret:
      secretName: adminuser
      password: password
  http:
    port: 8080

authentication type : tls
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: my-bridge-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapServers: xx.xx.xx.xx:31002
