# How to score means and p-values

I have multiple sets of data, example;
x= 0, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 0, 0
y= 10, 12.3, 14, 0 ,8, 0
and so on..
I have done a one sided t-test for each set and retrieved a p value for each.
I have also calculated the mean for each.
I would somehow like to score each set by how much they differ from zero, taking into account the p-value and mean.
Thanks
I have some sets with means of 500.. and very small p-values and others with means of 0.9 and p-values close to 0.05.
However is there a way i can relate the mean and p-value to score each set?
