# two different model into a single model

Lets say that I have a model that detects Apples, oranges and grapes in an image and I also have another model that detects Jack fruit and Banana in a image. So how do I create a model such that the model can detect Jack fruit, Banana, Apples, oranges and grapes?
My main query is how to combine both the above models?
I searched online and I found out about Ensemble technique, but I think ensemble techniques use the model which predict the same thing.
