# How to put a parameter in the assign function of DataFrames?

I would like to iterate over the columns and change the content of the columns with the assign function.

So in that example they show that you can use the assign function:
df = df.assign(industry='yyy')


To change the content of the column called industry.
I thought I could perform:
for column in df.columns[1:]:
     df = df.assign(column='yyy')


But now a new column with the label column is created, instead of all columns obtaining 'yyy' as content.
