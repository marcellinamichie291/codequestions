# How to store an NSImage as Data in an app group on macOS

In iOS I can store UIImage to an app group as Data. I can convert the png image with pngData() to a Data object:
let imageData = scaledImage.pngData()!

I store that object in an app group, retrieve it and convert ik back to an UIImage:
let image = UIImage(data: imageData)

It's works great, but it doesn't work on macOS. MacOS doesn't have a UIImage, but a NSImage. How can I convert an NSImage tot Data and back?
