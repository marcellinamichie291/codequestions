# Github actions to prevent a deletion of a piece of code

sorry If I am not able to explain better this inquiry but is there a way to create a github-action to detect if some piece of string/keyword in the PR was deleted and offer an action ( ignore/cancel, etc)?
I have a large repository used by developers with a sensitive piece of keywords inside and if one of them tries to delete that with a PR I would like to prevent it in an automated way.
EDIT:
I am using protected branches and the CI action is passing because the code is still valid but the piece of code for example:
def function(foo):
    #Do not delete this line
    print(foo)

has been deleted and I would like to avoid that, I would like to DENY a PR merge if this keyword "#Do not delete this line" is trying to be removed with the PR.
Thank you very much.
