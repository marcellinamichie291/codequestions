# ios app rejected, the app has been submitted by an Apple Developer Program account with a different seller and company name

We noticed that your app provides financial services for the financial institution but the app has been submitted by an Apple Developer Program account with a different seller and company name.
Unless you have authorization from the financial institution, an app offering financial services must be submitted by an account with a seller and company name that matches the institution.
what's the meaning of the problem above? how to resolve?
