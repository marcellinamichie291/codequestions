Using a 3 lead ECG device and the ProtoCentral HealthyPi v4 HAT microcontroller, I want to read data into visual studio in C#. I can connect to the serial port and I can create a chart, but I don't know how to convert the scanned data so that it can be displayed on the chart and not just a bunch of digits next to each other.
I receive the data in ASCII encoding, which I managed to convert to decimal. There is no separator between the numbers.
I found similar questions but in all of them they use the Arduino software, can I do it without using that?
