# drawing point on canvas not working on safari

I would like to use canvas to draw points on mouseover: my implementation works fine on chrome and firefox, but for some reason it doesn't work on safari (however, drawing a line on mouseover works on safari)
any help would be appreciated!

code:
let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");

let x = 0;
let y = 0;


let context = canvas.getContext("2d");
context.strokeStyle = "black";
context.lineWidth = 15;
context.lineCap = "round";

canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", function(e) {
  
    x = e.offsetX;
    y = e.offsetY;

  context.moveTo(x, y);
   context.lineTo(x, y);
    context.stroke();
});
