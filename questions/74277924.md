This is the example i am taking to understand the concept of "move" keyword
int main()
{
 int a=5;
 int temp = move(a);
 cout<<"Address of a="<<&a<<endl;
 cout<<"Address of temp="<<&temp<<endl;
}

Address of a=0x7ffd80b375b0
Address of temp=0x7ffd80b375b4

According to my understanding we are using the "move" keyword when copying is expensive and we don't care about what happens to the value of a variable/object after using it. Here we are not copying the data of "a" to "temp", we are just giving the same memory block( in this example "a") different name(in this example "temp"). This is my understanding of move keyword in c++.
What is the issue???
The issue is if I am printing the address of "a" and "temp" then it should come same , according to my understanding of move keyword. But unfortunately the value is not coming same.
Can anybody tell me why the address for "temp" and "a" is different?
Thanks in advance.
