# Terraform recreates BQ Dataset access resource every time there are changes in the plan

I manage my BQ infrastructure through Terraform.
I recently found out about the google_bigquery_dataset_access resource, which can be used to either grant access to a dataset to every resource of a specific type, or individually grant access for views.
So I implemented this in my foo dataset module
dataset.tf:
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "dataset_authorization" {
  dataset_id = "foo"
  dataset {
    dataset {
      project_id = "some-project"
      dataset_id = "bar"
    }
    target_types = ["VIEWS"]
  }
}

module "foo_dataset" {
  source  = <path to google provider google_bigquery_dataset>
  version = "some_version"

  dataset_id  = "foo"
  description = "lorem ipsum"
  location    = "some_location"
  project     = "some-project"

}

But every single time there is a change anywhere in my configuration (not even just in this foo module), TF plan says there's been changes to the access resource and it will try to recreate it
# module.foo.module.foo_dataset.google_bigquery_dataset.dataset has changed

  ~ resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {

      ~ etag                            = "VH7HJLt5Avl4zcT1spXxtA==" -> "ZQFENhnM/wOpJrgaccOfgQ=="

        id                              = "some-project:foo"

      ~ last_modified_time              = 1667311213019 -> 1667312336825

The etag and last_modified_time change even if no changes were done on the module
Anyone knows what might be going on here?
