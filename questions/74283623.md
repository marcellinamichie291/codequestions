# AZ CLI Task not logging in

I am somewhat new to AZURE Pipelines. Trying to run a simple bash script by itself that will create a resource group, storage account and container. I am being prompted by the Bash@3 task to run az login. Did some research and found out I likely need to add the AzureCLI@2 task as well, which I did. Still prompts me to run az login using a browser and device code. I did setup a service connection in ADO.
trigger:
- none

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:

- task: AzureCLI@2
  displayName: 'Prepare Credentials'
  inputs:
      addSpnToEnvironment: true
      azureSubscription: 'ADO'
      scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
      scriptType: 'bash'
      inlineScript: |
        az --version
        az login
- task: Bash@3
  inputs:
    filePath: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/Terraform/remotestate.sh'
    workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/Terraform/'
    failOnStderr: true
