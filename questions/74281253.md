# Hyperlink doesn't working in iMacros 2021 but does in iMacros version 12

I've written a macro in iMacros version 12and it works exactly like a user navigating through several pages in a application.
I'm trying to update the macro to work in iMacros version 2021.
The macro logs into the application, navigates to a specific page.  On that page the macro enters a "ref id" in a specific field and presses the search key.  The application displays the results on the next page.  So far so good.
The first field on the results page is a record number as a hyperlink.  In version 12, the macro clicks on the hyperlinked record number and continues the process.
In version 2021, the cursor remains as an arrow and does not change to the "finger".  This is the point I'm stuck at.  iMacros 2021 does not allow me to click on the hyperlinked record number.
Has anyone seen this behavior before in 2 different iMacros versions?  If so, were you able to resolve the issue and how did you resolve it.
I have never seen anything like this before.  Here is the code that I'm trying to execute to click on the hyperlink in version 2021.
IM = "CODE:"
IM = IM + "TAB T=1" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + "TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + "SET !TIMEOUT_STEP 1" + vbNewLine
IM = IM + "TAG POS=2 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:" & vLetters4(Y) + vbNewLine

Thanks in advance for your help......
