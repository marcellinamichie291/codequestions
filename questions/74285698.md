# Visual Studio Git

I use my Surface Pro 7 as my development machine.
Since the SSD only 256GB and the storage almost full.
So I plug a micro SD Card as D: and put the project on D: drive.
I think there is problem if I put my project to removable storage that Visual Studio cannot push the project changes to Github.
Is it the restriction of Git that the project cannot saved to removable storage?
