# Setting up a web server with node.js on a Raspberry PI

I am trying to set up a web server using node.js on a Raspberry PI 4 (Model B).
I have read a few tutorials to get started, but I can't finish putting the pieces together.
I have installed apache2 on the PI and I can see the web server working (with the default page) using apache2 by pointing a browser from another computer.
I have also installed node.js, I can confirm on the command line that it is working like this:
pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ node -v
v18.12.0
pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ npm -v
8.19.2
pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ 

Beside I have a page index.js on my local computer that I can see locally.
Starting the server with:
$ node index.js

And then using the browser to see the result.
I want to bring index.js to the PI and then serve it from there.
What do I need to do to achieve that?
