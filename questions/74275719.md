For my programming class I need to make an animated poster but we're getting stuck. Does anyone maybe have a template we can take some inspiration from or help.
Thanks!
The movie is Mary Poppins so we already got her silhouette flying through the air by pressing keys and we got clouds behind her that are moving randomly but that's ofcourse not enough.
