# How can I select a document where a maximum subdocument from an array has a certain property?

My document contains an array of subdocuments. Each subdocument has two values - one is a number and the other is a string. One example of such documents would be:
[{
properties: 
    [{
        "A": "Forest",
        "B": 1
    },
    {
        "A": "Mountain",
        "B": 2
    },
    {
        "A": "Lake",
        "B": 3
    }]
},{
properties: 
    [{
        "A": "Forest",
        "B": 1
    },
    {
        "A": "Lake",
        "B": 2
    },
    {
        "A": "Mountain",
        "B": 3
    }]
},
]

where properties is the array of subdocuments. Subdocuments are indexed by both B and A. The maximum subdocument in this context is the one with the largest B.
If I query Lake, the result is supposed to be:
[{
properties: 
    [{
        "A": "Forest",
        "B": 1
    },
    {
        "A": "Mountain",
        "B": 2
    },
    {
        "A": "Lake",
        "B": 3
    }]
}]

because that is a document where the maximum subdocument contains A equal to Lake.
How can I perform this query?
I found a similar question here - Highest value from sub-arrays in documents - but this question is about retrieving the documents with the maximum B. Mine is about filtering documents by property A of maximum B.
I would appreciate any pointers.
