# Trim all Chars from String

I would like to truncate all characters in a column, no matter where they are.
Example:
"+49123/4567890(testnumber)"
Should be changed to
"491234567890"
Is there a way without doing a replace for each char?
I have tried to replace it with several, but it is very time-consuming.
