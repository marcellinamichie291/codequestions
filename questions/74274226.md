# How to calculate superscript values in SQL

I have prices coming in my source file like below -
78-22¼,
78-18⅝
I need to calculate these price. For example for first case result should be 78-22.25. I searched a lot but found that SQL supports few of these characters only. Is there anyway to make sure we are able to calculate for whatever value we are getting. Solution in either SQL or PowerShell could work.
