# Does a linter that ensures the object is not undefined when accessing its properties exist?

I'm looking for a linter that can find errors caused by not checking if object(s) exist before accessing its properties, and the 'sub'-properties.
E.g. it should raise an error for this code
const x = foo.prop
Where it should be
const x = foo && foo.prop
A nice bonus would be raising an error in a case like this
const x = foo && foo.prop.prop2 where the object itself is checked, but all properties might not be.
Any way of doing this is fine - be it an eslint plugin, pre-commit hooks via husky or similar.
Using ?. notation is not currently an option for us as we still need to support some browsers without this feature.
We've looked for any way of doing this, and it seems this only exists on typescript as an eslint rule, and not JS. We haven't been able to find any existing eslint plugins on npm or similar that does this either.
