# How to clear underneath app from stack after launching it?

Practically on app start I run simultaneously a service and a device application, the service has a button that on click brings the user to my apps main activity, now my problem is that when I press back button I see that the launched app is still there. What I tried so far was calling this function intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK); but it didn't work, I guess because that's not my activity. Don't have a minimum clue how to do it. Any solutions would be appreciated.
