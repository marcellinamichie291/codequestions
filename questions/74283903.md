# How can I make rounded border with CSS?


I mean the green rounded border that's outside the check icon. Currently, I have the entire circle around the check but I'm really confused about how to introduce that little cut in the top-left corner.
Here's the code:


<div v-if="verified" class="flex justify-center items-center border-3 border-green rounded-full">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 15 14" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="w-3 h-3">
          <path
            d="m10.51 4.525-3.6 3.6-1.65-1.65a.636.636 0 0 0-.9.9l2.1 2.1a.636.636 0 0 0 .9 0l4.05-4.05a.636.636 0 0 0-.9-.9z"
            fill="#fff"
          />
        </svg>
</div>



There's the SVG, and I'm using Tailwind, so the border class is right there in the <div>. Any suggestion/help is greatly appreciated, thanks!
