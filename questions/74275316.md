# I have irregular java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method issues in complex multi module project

Basically, it starts with me making some refactoring like moving the extension to another file, then I get an exception of this type in some place of code at runtime and I have to find the right module and delete manually the build folder.
If any has some more insights or a better solution would be nice.
I use gradle.properties:
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache=false

Setting configuration-cache=true makes this issue frequent.
