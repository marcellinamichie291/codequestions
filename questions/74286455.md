# C# Filestreamresult not returning file instead syntax unexpected token 'P' error

I am new to using Filestreamresult and MemoryStream. I am trying to download excel file. Below is the code in C#.
var stream = await _exposureRatingRiskProfileDownloadTemplateService.Get(sessionId, erConfigId, request);
        await stream.FlushAsync();
        stream.Position = 0;
        return new FileStreamResult(stream, new MediaTypeHeaderValue("application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"))
        {
            FileDownloadName = fileName
        };

I am using the above code to download a xlsx file. It was working fine earlier, but all of sudden getting the following error. Not sure what is wrong. Can anyone please help with this?

Thanks
When i try from Postman with 'Send and Download' i am able to download the file. But only 'Send' not working. Should i add any content headers?
