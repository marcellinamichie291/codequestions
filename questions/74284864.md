# Typescript transform output into nested array

I have this array of records which is being duplicated for each users's courses:
id  name  courseId  title   
1   user 1  11  course A
1   user 1  22  course B
2   user 2  33  course C
3   user 3  44  course D

But actually I want response like this, I want to remove the duplicated record of user and put courses as an array against each user
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "user 1",
    "courses": [
      {
        "courseId": 11,
        "title": "course A",
      },
      {
        "courseId": 22,
        "title": "course B",
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "user 2",
    "courses": [
      {
        "courseId": 33,
        "title": "course C",
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "user 3",
    "courses": [
      {
        "courseId": 44,
        "title": "course D",
      }
    ]
  }
] 

I am very new to Typescript, how can I achieve this response in an optimized way?
