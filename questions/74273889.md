# How to split the chain (Reply & Forward) of email from MSG or EML file using the C# application?

I have an application. It first reads thousand of Msg and Eml files and then converts them into a word document. Some of the individual emails have a chain of emails (Reply and forward emails). We want a split every single email into separate word document files. When we open an email in the outlook application and open a word document in the word application the look and feel must be an exact match in both applications
We want the best approach to achieve the Above stuff.
I have tried with regular expression but not properly split. The look and feel also do not exactly match.
