# Add a substring based on a condition in r

I would like to add a substring add the end of a string variable in my data. This variable represents a question asked during a specific case and can be either irrelevant ("00"), partially relevant ("01") or very relevant ("02"). Hence I would like to make this a conditional statement based on the specific value of the case ID. Here is some sample data:




Case_ID
Question




1234
QS1


4321
QS1


1234
QS3


1234
QS2


4321
QS3


4321
QS2




Where:
Case_ID 1234: QS1 very relevant ("02") , QS2 irrelevant ("00"), QS3 irrelevant ("00) AND
Case_ID 4321: QS1 irrelevant ("00"), QS2 partially relevant ("01"), QS3 very relevant ("02).
I hope to receive the following output:




Case_ID
Question




1234
QS102


4321
QS100


1234
QS300


1234
QS200


4321
QS302


4321
QS201
