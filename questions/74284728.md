# https://<domain>/route doesn't work but https:///www.<domain>/route works

It seems that it works with https and www but curiously doesn't work with https alone.
Though if you access the domain with just https (no route), it works. See below to avoid confusion:
Works:
https://<domain>
https://www.<domain>/route

Doesn't work:
https://<domain>/route

Is it possible to make a redirect in GoDaddy instead of htaccess? Thanks.
