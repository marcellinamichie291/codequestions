This is best explained by an example:
netlist::get_netlist(std::string &filename){      
     auto project = read_project(filename);      
     return get_netlist(project);
} 

That calls another function (often overloaded)
netlist::get_netlist(project_t project){ 
...
     > 100 lines to read netlist 
... 
     return netlist;
}

I often find this in projects and I feel this can be better written if it's all in the same function.
Shouldn't functions be specific and do one thing ? what's the reason behind complicating code like this?
PS: they are both Public methods of the netlist class ...
