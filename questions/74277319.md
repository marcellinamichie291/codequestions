# WARNING: Multiple variants of AWS Tools for PowerShell are currently installed

When I run a powershell script, I get the following warning:

WARNING: Multiple variants of AWS Tools for PowerShell (AWSPowerShell,
AWSPowerShell.NetCore or AWS.Tools) are currently installed. Please
run 'Get-Module -Name
AWSPowerShell,AWSPowerShell.NetCore,AWS.Tools.Common -ListAvailable'
for details. To avoid problems with cmdlet auto-importing, it is
suggested to only install one variant. AWS.Tools is the new
modularized version of AWS Tools for PowerShell, compatible with
PowerShell Core 6+ and Windows Powershell 5.1+ (when .NET Framework
4.7.2+ is installed). AWSPowerShell.NetCore is the monolithic variant that supports all AWS services in a single large module, it is
compatible with PowerShell Core 6+ and Windows Powershell 3+ (when
.NET Framework 4.7.2+ is installed). AWSPowerShell is the legacy
module for older systems which are either running Windows PowerShell 2
or cannot be updated to .NET Framework 4.7.2 (or newer).

How do I fix the warning? Do I uninstall one or 2 of these modules? Which ones?
