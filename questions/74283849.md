I am now using Ubuntu v 22.04 but sometimes my device freezes.  The problem is when I am running an application, sometimes my device freezes. I can not press anything and to solve it, I always restart my device to restart it. I always hold Alt + PrtScr and type REISUB and it will be restarted I make it not freeze?
