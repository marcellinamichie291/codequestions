# How do I fix a git "fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly" error?

So when I've committed everything on my local branch and I'm ready to push to remote origin I will receive this error randomly:
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
remote: 
remote: ========================================================================
remote: 
remote: ERROR: user canceled the push

remote: 
remote: ========================================================================
remote: 

This really only happens when I'm trying to push to a remote branch for the first time. So for example git push --set-upstream origin feature/Project-XXXX/new-feature. This error only happens seemingly randomly.
My only solution so far is to keep reentering the command until it finally gives in and pushes it to remote. I can not remember if this happens in regular pushes but I don't believe it has.
Please help! I haven't seen an error like this anywhere else. I've tried things like git config http.postBuffer 524288000, downgrading the HTTP to 1.1 and then back to 2, but nothing works.
