# CSS transition within JavaScript not working

Here is my HTML, CSS, JS


const Col = document.querySelectorAll('.col')

function onCol() {
  Col.forEach(function(el, idx) {
    el.style.transition = '0s';
    el.style.height = '0%';
    el.style.transition = '0.9s';
    el.style.height = '100%';
  });
}
onCol()
.work {
  display: flex;
  height: 140px
}

.col {
  background: red;
  width: 20px;
  height: 100%;
  margin-left: 5px;
  max-height: 0
}
<div class="work">
  <div class="col"></div>
  <div class="col"></div>
  <div class="col"></div>
  <div class="col"></div>
  <div class="col"></div>
</div>



I think that columns should become bigger SMOOTHLY WITH TRANSITION 0.9 !!!
but they do not.
If I type the word with el.style.height = '100%'; into setTimeOut, it will work.
but I don't want to make this in callback queue.
I just want to solve this in the call stack.
and I want to know why doesn't this work now.
i changed this with for loop. but not works
