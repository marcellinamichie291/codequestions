# How to save array data with python?

I developed code in python (in Pycharm) that generates an array. I would like to save the data from this array in a way that I can import this data file into Jupyter and call the elements with array[i][j] notation.
I already tried a way to do this I used the following command in Pycharm
with open(path + '/data_Sevol.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
     fieldnames = ['Sevol']
     writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
     writer.writeheader()
     for i in range(len(Sevol)):
         writer.writerow({'Sevol': Sevol[i]})

and called the data in Jupyter
data_Sevol = pd.read_csv(path + str("\\") + str("data_Sevol.csv"))

However, the output in Jupyter is an array with 300 rows and 1 column. It turns out that the data was saved line by line and not element by element. The way this is as follows:

and I would like the elements to be separated by rows and columns (or instead of having only 1 column, there would be 300 columns as well..square matrix). How can I fix this and call the elements with array[i][j] notation in Jupyter.
