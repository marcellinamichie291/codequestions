# Why "key in myObject" does not narrow the type if key is of type string?

I don't understand this:
const VALUES = {
  name: "name",
  age: "age",
  address: "address",
};

export function getVal(key: string) {
  if (key in VALUES) {
// Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ name: string; age: string; address: string; }'.
//  No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ name: string; age: string; address: string; }'.ts(7053)
    return VALUES[key];
  }

  return "";
}

The conditional is explicitly making the key be one of the keys in VALUES in the true branch. So why is typescript complaining? Wouldn't key in obj narrow key to be one of the keys in obj?
I understand I can do one of two things to fix it:
A/
const VALUES: { [index: string]: string } = {
  name: "name",
  age: "age",
  address: "address",
};

B/
export function getVal(key: keyof typeof VALUES) {
  ...
}

But what if I want to keep VALUES type constrained to those keys, and/or the key param remain as a string?
