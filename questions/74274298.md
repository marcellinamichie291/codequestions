# Set Legal Hold in Azure Blob using REST API

Has anyone tried calling set legal hold API from Azure Data Factory Web activity using Managed Identity. The MI of ADF has Storage Blob Data Owner on the storage account. But when I call this API from Web Activity it gives below error:
InvalidQueryParameterValue Value of one of the query parameters specified in the URI is invalid. Parameter Name comp and parameter value legalhold
Below is the settings of web activity:

P.S. The other GET APIs work successfully. Also, I am looking only via MI and not SAS
