# C++ read "enter" in command line

I have a very simple question.
I have a project like below:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string file_name;
    cin >> file_name;
    ifstream file(file_name);
    if(file.good()){
        cout << "File can be loaded";
    }
    else{
        cout << "Default file will be loaded";
    }
    return 0;
}

In the command line, if I just hit Enter on my keyboard, I want to read nothing in file_name and then it will load a default file automatically. The current situation is it will wait until I type in something.
How can I do this?
