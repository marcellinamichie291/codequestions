# Angular 13 : converting base64 to file

I am uploading image to S3, before uploading i am using image compression that return base64 string in result. I tried to convert base64 string to file before uploading
var file = new File([base64string], fileName, { type: 'image/png' });

but while i check the uploaded file it is malformed.
