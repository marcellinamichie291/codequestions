# How to uninstall a github package with all its dependencies brew

I tried to install valgrind using brew except that the version is not compatible on MacOs Monterey.
brew install --HEAD LouisBrunner/valgrind/valgrind

The problem is that this command installed a lot of brew dependencies that were not present, I would like to know how to remove this valgrind package and everything that came with it.
Sorry if it seems like a silly mistake but I haven't found a solution to this problem
