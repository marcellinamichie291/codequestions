# How to make bar charts for columns of a dataframe all at once?

I have several catigorical and numeric features in a pandas data frame.
For the numeric features I was able to plot several histograms at once, using this code: (the data was downloaded from kaggle).
%matplotlib inline

axarr = temp.hist(bins=45, figsize=(20, 15))  # histograms of dataframe variables. Pick number of bins!
xlbl = ['Age [$Years$]', 'fnlwgt', 'capital_gain[$dollars$]','capital_loss [$dollars$]', 
        'hours_per_week']

for idx, ax in enumerate(axarr.flatten()):
    ax.set_xlabel(xlbl[idx])
    ax.set_ylabel("Count")
    
plt.show()

Now I'm trying to do the same for the catigorical values (bar plots), using thise code:
xlbl = ['workclass', 'education', 'educational-num','marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race',
       'gender', 'native_country', 'income']
BARplt = sns.displot(data=temp2);

for idx, ax in enumerate(BARplt.flatten()):
    ax.set_xlabel(xlbl[idx])
    ax.set_ylabel("Count")
    
plt.show()

This is producing an error:
----> 7 for idx, ax in enumerate(BARplt.flatten()):
      8     ax.set_xlabel(xlbl[idx])
      9     ax.set_ylabel("Count")

AttributeError: 'FacetGrid' object has no attribute 'flatten'

and at the same time, it shows the barplot of the educational-num variable.
NOTE: numeric and catigorical features and were separated. numeric in temp df and catogirical in temp2 df.
How can I do that?
