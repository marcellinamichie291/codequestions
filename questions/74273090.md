# (GeometryTypeError: Unknown geometry type: featurecollection) How to extend a function to all values in a column dependent on another dataframe?

I have written a function to check if a point is within a polygon, and if it is to return "True,{branch_name}" where branch_name is the name of the polygon, and when trying to extend this function to the whole column, I keep encountering the "GeometryTypeError: Unknown geometry type: featurecollection" error.
The function I have written is:
def latlon_check(intsct, area, branch): #intsct = point, area = polygon, branch= branch name
    check = intsct.within(shape(area))
    if check == True:
        within.append(f"True,{branch}")
    else:
        within.append(f"False")
    return within

intsct is in df1 - a dataframe with a few hundred rows in it
area and branch are in df2 - a data frame with 10 rows
Note: The function works fine when inputting single values as arguments.
I want to make a new column in df1 where every row will either say "False" or "True,{branch_name}" showing which branch the point is in.
Using:
df1['within'] = df1['intsct'].apply(latlon_check, args = (df2['area'],df2['branch']))

and get the error:
GeometryTypeError: Unknown geometry type: featurecollection

I have tried rewriting the column as a string then converting it back to 'geometry' and still had the same error, will appreciate any help!
