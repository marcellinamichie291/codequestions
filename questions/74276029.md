# How can I use customer object on HTML template? Is there any way to do this?

I want to access customer object on html form template, is there any way to do this other than creating object on our own.
I created different class for customer with customer.ts file.
Below is the component class:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Customer } from '../customer';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-cutomer-form',
  templateUrl: './cutomer-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./cutomer-form.component.css']
})
export class CutomerFormComponent implements OnInit {
  

  constructor(private customer: Customer) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }


  customerForm(data: any){
    
  }

}


I tried creating object, then i can access the class data but i dont want to create object rather I have to implement dependency injection concept here. How can we achieve this?
