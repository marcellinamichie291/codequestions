# Will the flutter dropdown button work on an iOS device?

Not a coding question. I'm building a registration page in my flutter app where the user will need to select their hometown using the flutter dropdown button. But my main concern is whether the dropdown button will work on an iOS device or not. I know that there is another widget called the Cupertino Picker, which is used as a substitute for the dropdown button. Since I don't own and never have owned an iOS device, so I don't know whether the dropdown button will work on an iOS device. Moreover, I also don't have a MacBook, so I can't test it using an iOS simulator.
Will the flutter dropdown button work or do I have to build a platform-specific widget?Â If I use the dropdown button on an iOS device, will the app crash?
