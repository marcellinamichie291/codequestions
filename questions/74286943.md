# using dot-trace to analyze high CPU usage application

My application is based on .NET CORE 3.1 in a Ubuntu20 x64 machine, and randomly experiencing High Cpu(100% for 4 cores) cases.
I'm following diagnostics to start a diag for my app likeï¼š
dotnet-trace collect -p 1039 --providers Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler

from the resulted .nettrace file opened in Visual Studio, I can see the Funcions list with used CPU Time for each single function, this is good.
But I noticed the CPU time here is actually the wall time, like the hotest spot (the chart says it used over 70% Total CPU) now is pointing to this line of code: Thread.Sleep(1000), obviously this blocking will not consume real CPU resource, so any way to trace the functions that used the real cpu usage?
