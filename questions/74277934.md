# Avoid delegate allocation capture when subscripting to event

I want to subscribe to the Closed event of Window, and in that subscription, it should modify a variable that is outside of the subscription delegate.
Is there a way to pass an argument or avoid allocation closure when subscribing like this?
ReSharper says `Delegate allocation: capture of 'this' reference.
public class MyWindow : Window
{
    private bool _closed;

    public MyWindow()
    {
        Closed += (_, _) =>
        {
            _closed = true;
        }
    }
}

I can't think of a way to pass the MyWindow instance into the subscription to avoid this.
