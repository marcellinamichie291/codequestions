# I am having issue to run my NLP model with JupyterLab on Google Cloud Platform

I am facing a problem running my model on GCP. Everything was working fine before and then one day I was not able to have access to my notebook anymore. I was obliged to create a new notebook and yesterday my tensorflow was disturbing (throwing many messages that I have used to seacrh on google), I followed some steps and my notebook start running and then stop again. When I try to run the notebook now, I get bellow error. I am using PyTorch for my code. Thanks

I have try to search on google but didn't find accurate answer for my problem. I am expecting some guidance to solve the problem.
