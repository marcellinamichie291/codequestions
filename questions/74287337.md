# Push git changes to a shared network drive, data on remote repository not visible

I do have a local repository on my local drive and a remote repository on my network drive.
Everything is working, i can push data to the remote repository and my colleague is able to pull my data from the remote repository on the shared network drive. There is just one mystery. I do not see the data on the remote repository on the network drive? Is the data in a different form in the .git\objects folder?
i expected if i push sth to the remote repository on the network drive it will appear (data ist visible) on the remote repository.
