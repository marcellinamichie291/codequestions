# API Gateway (Kong or Tyk):. Can I have swagger-ui on gateway?

I am in the process of implementing an API Gateway as a point of access to several existing APIs that run as microservices.
Each microservice API is defined in OpenAPI and runs an instance of swagger-ui to document and expose endpoints.  Everything is written in Ruby on Rails as separate API-only projects.
I'm looking at Kong or Tyk in the role of API Gateway.  Is it possible with either project to run swagger-ui on the gateway to document available routes through the gateway and to allow authenticated users to try the various endpoints exposed by the different services in one place rather than per-service?  If not, does either project provide such an interface in any form?
