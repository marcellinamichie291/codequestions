# Crystal Reports dynamic parameter

In Crystal Reports 2020, I have a dynamic parameter. Since there can be 100000's of values, the user does not want to scroll through all of them,but wants an option to enter the value in a search box (like when we set Static parameter) and then add it to Selected Values box.
Is it possible?
