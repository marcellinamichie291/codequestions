# Not Printing anything on screen

def even_number_list(even_list):
    for i in even_list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            return True
        else:
            pass
        
even_number_list([1,3,5,6,9])

This code is not printing anything on the screen, I believe that it should print True, please help a beginner.
Thanks,
I think I'll get an output, True
