# How to open a program within another already open program window through terminal? (PyMOL)

I have a python script that, when you type in the PDB code for a protein, will generate pictures of the protein as well as make a movie of it. However when I run all of this at the same time (by having python open and run the .pml file that does all of this) it takes too long, so I split the .pml file up into a 'generate pictures' file and 'make movie' file, and would like to run the 'make movie' file after the user enters 'y I would like to make a movie' into python. Is it possible to open a pml file in the same window of another that has been opened?
I tried to run the two pml files one after the other but I want to wait for and respond to user input so this doesn't work.
Thank you
