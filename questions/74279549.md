# I need a count of serial numbers (last 6 months) that are under warranty for a failure rate report

My table has the following columns:
SerialNo
ProductNo
WarrantyBeginDt
WarrantyEndDT
I would like to get a monthly in warranty count looking back about 6 months. I know how to get a month by specifying in the where clause. Would like to have a query that generates the last 6 months with out having to specify the month in the where clause.
SELECT count(*)
FROM Supplemental_Warranty
WHERE WarrantyBeginDt <= '6-15-2022' AND WarrantyEndDt >= '6-15-2022'
How could I create a query that looks back 6 months from the current date?
