# mocking partials in jest: need to check that an inner function gets called

Here's a madeup piece of code to illustrate what I need:
const mulByFactor = (factor: number) => (x: number): number => factor * x;

export const mulHandler = (a: number[], factor: number): number[] => {
    const mulBy = mulByFactor(factor);
    return a.map(mulBy);
};

console.log(mulHandler([1, 2, 3, 4], 2));

All this code is placed in a separate file. I'm writing tests in another file and one of the tests that I want to have there should check that mulByFactor is called.
describe('mulHandler tests', () => {

    it('should check that mulByFactor is called', () => {

    });
});
