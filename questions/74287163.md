# How to publish Vue3 components each in separate NPM registry

I have blank Vue3 application created with npm init vue@3 and I want to publish each of my future components in private NPM registry so I can install them like:
npm i @my-registry/app/component-name

I am new in NPM packages and want to know whether is it possible to do so.
