# How can I allow an ECS Task to assume a role in another account

Specifically what my setup looks like, what I tried to do, and what it failed with
I tried to run an ECS Task in Account B that assumes a role in Account A, however I got an access denied error in my ECS Task logs.  (Below I mention quicksight just to add the context of why I'm assuming a role in another account.  I'm not asking about how to interact with quicksight, just how to assume a role in another account from within my ECS Task.)
Account A:

Has quicksight deployed
Has a role, QuickSightInteractionRole, for interacting with quicksight which should be "assumable" from account B
QuickSightInteractionRole has a trust relationship like this:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::<account_b_id>:role/MyECSTaskRole",
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

Account B:

Runs my ECS Task that wants to assume the role, QuickSightInteractionRole, that exists in account A
The mentioned ECS Task runs with the "Task Role", MyECSTaskRole, which has an attached policy granting it permission to assume the role, QuickSightInteractionRole, in account A.
MyECSTaskRole has an attached policy like this:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<account_a_id>:role/QuickSightInteractionRole"
        }
    ]
}

When I run my ECS Task in account B it tries to assume the QuickSightInteractionRole role in account A like this:
def assume_role(sts, account_id=None, role_name=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs['RoleArn'] = f"arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/{role_name}"
    kwargs['RoleSessionName'] = kwargs.get('RoleSessionName', 'EnvironmentCreator')
    credentials = sts.assume_role(**kwargs)['Credentials']
    return credentials['AccessKeyId'], credentials['SecretAccessKey'], credentials['SessionToken']


access_key, secret_key, session_token = assume_role(
    sts = boto3.client('sts', region_name=<region>),
    account_id=<account_a_id>,
    role_name=`QuickSightInteractionRole`,
    DurationSeconds=3600
)

But I get an access denied error upon trying to assume the role:
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:sts::<account_b_id>:assumed-role/MyECSTaskRole/33b237414a014f118891fc1c436f9ed5 is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::<account_a_id>:role/QuickSightInteractionRole

 What did I try, what did I expect to happen, and what actually happened summarized
I tried to run an ECS Task that programmatically assumes a role in another account and I expected to work because I thought I'd configured all of my IAM permissions correctly, however, my code and my ECS Task fail upon trying to assume the role.
