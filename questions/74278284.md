# Jest expect a mock to be called only once with an argument

If I am testing a function and want to make sure it is only called once with an argument how can I do that succinctly?
This is the sort of function I am testing (I can't produce a MCVE here, but see later for something similar from jest-extended):
const patHeadAndShout = (birdName, thisChild, otherChild) => {
  thisChild.patHead(otherChild);
  thisChild.shout(birdName);
};
const duckDuckGoose = (thisChild, birdArray) => birdArray.some(bird => {
  patHeadAndShout(bird.name, thisChild, ChildrenCircle.next());
  if (birdName === BirdNameEnum.GOOSE) {
    thisChild.runAwayFrom(otherChild);
    return true;
  }
});

And my test is currently:
const testingBirdArray = [BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.GOOSE];

it('only calls patHeadAndShout with 'goose' once', () => {
  jest.spyOn(Games, 'patHeadAndShout');
  Games.duckDuckGoose(testingBirdArray, new ChildrenCircle(testingBirdArray.length+1));
  expect(Games.patHeadAndShout).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4);
  expect(Games.patHeadAndShout).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(4, 'goose');
});

This feels a little fragile, and inelegant. Of course I can get rid of toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4)if only check the function islastCalledWith` goose but then if somehow my function is broken like so:
const duckDuckGoose = (thisChild, birdArray) => birdArray.some(bird => {
  patHeadAndShout(bird.name, thisChild, ChildrenCircle.next());
  if (birdName === BirdNameEnum.GOOSE) {
    thisChild.shout(birdName); // <-- the dreaded double goose shout
    thisChild.runAwayFrom(otherChild);
    return true;
  }
});

It passes incorrectly (it's still last called with 'goose' but we got rid of the toHaveBeenCalledTimes check which would have flagged it up).
If I use the jest-extended function [toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith][1] it still fails:

Use .toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith to check if a Mock was called exactly one time with the expected value.
test('passes only if mock was called exactly once with the expected value', () => {
 const mock = jest.fn();

 expect(mock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
 mock('hello');
 mock('goodbye')
 expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith('hello');
});

Expected mock function to have been called exactly once, but it was called:
2 times

The messy solution would be to filter the fn.mock.calls ... but that is, like I said, messy:
const testingBirdArray = [BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.DUCK, BirdNameEnum.GOOSE];

it('only calls patHeadAndShout with 'goose' once', () => {
  jest.spyOn(Games, 'patHeadAndShout');
  Games.duckDuckGoose(testingBirdArray, new ChildrenCircle(testingBirdArray.length+1));
  const { calls, lastCall } = Games.patHeadAndShout.mock;
  expect(calls.filter((args) => args[0] === 'goose')[0]).toEqual(lastCall);
});

Is there a more elegant way to achieve this, without being too fragile?
