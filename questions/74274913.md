# How to write a wrapper function for FindOptions in go mongo-driver

I want to write a wrapper function for FindOptions in my dbobject code so that I can avoid importing package options in my service code .  Basically i'm trying to accomodate three func under one interface
SetSkip() 
SetLimit()
SetSort()

Also I want to know the usage of MergeFindOptions
func MergeFindOptions(opts ...*FindOptions) *FindOptions

Any examples will be of great help.
