# Postgres Date checking - is_date fn shortcircuit

I have a set of records in a table, with some records having invalid date. I wanted to ignore those invalid records and do a check with rest of the records. I framed a query like below but I don't find it working.
select * from tbl_name i
             where is_date(i.dob) and i.dob::date > CURRENT_DATE;

I got to know that sql doesn't short circuit so it also consider invalid record and end up in date/time out of range. Please help me alter this query in a way i could eliminate invalid dates and do date comparison on valid dates only.
