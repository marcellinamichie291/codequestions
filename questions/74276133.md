# Ruby Event Store::Wrong Expected Event Version

I got error RubyEventStore::WrongExpectedEventVersion, but i don't know why.
And the page displays the code referenced by the error Rails.configuration.event_store.publish(event, stream_name: type)
What is the problem and where can I find a solution?
