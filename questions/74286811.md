# How to make macro run every 30 seconds

I have the following macro that takes the data from the MAIN sheet and copies it into the Static Data sheet.

Public Sub CopyMain()
    Dim i As Long
    i = 1
    Worksheets("Static Data").Cells.ClearContents
    With Worksheets("Static Data")
        
        Worksheets(i).Range("A1").CurrentRegion.Copy .Range("A1")
        .Range("A1").CurrentRegion.Value = .Range("A1").CurrentRegion.Value
    End With
    Call macro_timer
End Sub


I am trying to run this macro every 10 seconds. Such that every 10 seconds the data from MAIN is copied into the Static Data sheet.
I define the following sub above CopyMain:
Sub macro_timer()
'Tells Excel when to next run the macro.
    Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:30"), "my_macro"

End Sub

However, this fails basic testing like changing a few values in MAIN and they aren't being copied to the second sheet at 30 second intervals
