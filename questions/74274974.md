# Uploading a zip file using curl in python

hi i have a simple curl command that i want to implement using request but as i am a bit new to python i am not able to follow with the examples i found so if any one can help me understand the requests.put while converting the curl command.
this is the curl command :
curl -u user:<token> -X PUT "http://<Artifactory url>/something.zip" -T something.zip

i have already tried this approach but the zip file shows 0kb
requests.put('https://<Artifactory url>/something.zip', auth=(user, token))

thanks for the help.
