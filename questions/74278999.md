# Create a dictionary with values from another dictionary

Here's the challenge: Imagine you're working on an electronic diary application. Create a dictionary where the key will be the student's name and the value will be another 3-element dictionary containing the subject name and grade.
var items = ["Mathematics": 4, "Literature": 5, "Chemistry": 3]
var diary = ["Mike": items]
print(diary)
