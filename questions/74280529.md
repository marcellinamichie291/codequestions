# ssh: connect to host ssh.github.com port 443: Connection timed out while pusing to github

Since the last Ubuntu update I can't push using the cmd, and I don't know why (prob. a coincidence).
If I type:
ssh -T git@github.com 

-> ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out 
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com 

-> ssh: connect to host ssh.github.com port 443: Connection timed out
Right now I only have one pair of keys, the id_ed25519.pub added to my github account. And my ~/.ssh/config looks like:
Host github.com
 Hostname ssh.github.com
 Port 443

What I don't understand is that If I use SmartGit for pushing, it ask me for the key and passphrase and I can push with it, using the id_ed25519 key.

I don't have a firewall. 
I tried with other networks to check if my ISP was blocking those ports (22), but it did not work.
If I change a repo from git@github.com/username/repo to https://github.com/username/repo I can push with username & password.

I did look for solutions, but none work for me, that's why I'm posting here.
