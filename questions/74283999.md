# XML canonicalization in Delphi7

I am modifying an old project with Delphi7 to use certificate and signing. My goal and what I need is to find a way to canonicalize XML before signing it. I have the follow restrictions :

I have to use Delphi7.
Application must run on Windows7 32 bit.
I can't use any Dot Net library or any other commercial library.

Waiting for some advises or samples.Note : I tried Microsoft webservices.dll but no luck.
