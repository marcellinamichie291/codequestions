# got Can't resolve 'react/jsx-runtime' error while running jest

I am having a project which is using react 16.X and with es6 and I added babel config
something like this
module.exports = { presets: [ '@babel/preset-env', ['@babel/preset-react', {runtime: 'automatic'}], ], };
But I am getting 'react/jsx-runtime'  error on running jest
