# Convert Oracle SQL Query to MySQL

I have just written an Oracle SQL query for a school project and apparently we need it to be in MySQL. I have no knowledge of the latter. How can I convert it to MySQL Dialect? Thanks in advance!
The query :
         SELECT C.CITY_NAME,
         'XX/XX/XXXX' WEEK,
         TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'Day') DAY,
         TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') HOUR,
         /* Use for No of Requests*/
         COUNT (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP) NO_OF_REQUEST,
         /* Use for Unfilled Orders*/
         (SELECT COUNT (tr.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP)
            FROM TRIPS TR
           WHERE     CITY_ID = C.CITY_ID
                 AND TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                        TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM')
                 AND ORDER_STATUS = 'unfulfilled')
            UNFILLED_ORDERS,
         /* Use for Request Accept After x Min */
         (SELECT   (  SUM (
                         TO_NUMBER (
                              TO_CHAR (ACCEPT_TIMESTAMP, 'HH')
                            - TO_NUMBER (TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH'))))
                    * 60)
                 + SUM (
                      TO_NUMBER (
                           TO_CHAR (ACCEPT_TIMESTAMP, 'MI')
                         - TO_NUMBER (TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'MI'))))
            FROM TRIPS
           WHERE     CITY_ID = C.CITY_ID
                 AND TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                        TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM'))
            REQUEST_ACCEPTED_AFTER_X_MINS,
         /*Minimum Radius*/
         (SELECT MIN (RADIUS.RADIUS_END - RADIUS.RADIUS_BEGIN)
            FROM TRIPS
                 INNER JOIN CITIES ON TRIPS.CITY_ID = CITIES.CITY_ID
                 INNER JOIN RADIUS ON CITIES.CITY_NAME = RADIUS.CITY_NAME
           WHERE TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                    TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM'))
            MINIMUM_RADIUS,
         /*Maximun Radius*/
         (SELECT MAX (RADIUS.RADIUS_END - RADIUS.RADIUS_BEGIN)
            FROM TRIPS
                 INNER JOIN CITIES ON TRIPS.CITY_ID = CITIES.CITY_ID
                 INNER JOIN RADIUS ON CITIES.CITY_NAME = RADIUS.CITY_NAME
           WHERE TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                    TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM'))
            MAXIMUM_RADIUS,
         /*Average Radius*/
         (SELECT AVG (RADIUS.RADIUS_END - RADIUS.RADIUS_BEGIN)
            FROM TRIPS
                 INNER JOIN CITIES ON TRIPS.CITY_ID = CITIES.CITY_ID
                 INNER JOIN RADIUS ON CITIES.CITY_NAME = RADIUS.CITY_NAME
           WHERE TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                    TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM'))
            AVERAGE_RADIUS,
         /*Peak Time Radius*/
         (SELECT AVG (
                    CASE
                       WHEN TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH') BETWEEN 12 AND 14
                       THEN
                          RADIUS.RADIUS_END - RADIUS.RADIUS_BEGIN
                       WHEN TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH') BETWEEN 19 AND 21
                       THEN
                          RADIUS.RADIUS_END - RADIUS.RADIUS_BEGIN

            FROM TRIPS
                 INNER JOIN CITIES ON TRIPS.CITY_ID = CITIES.CITY_ID
                 INNER JOIN RADIUS ON CITIES.CITY_NAME = RADIUS.CITY_NAME
           WHERE TO_CHAR (REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM') =
                    TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM'))
            AVERAGE_PEAK_TIME_RADIUS
         FROM CITIES C
         INNER JOIN TRIPS T ON C.CITY_ID = T.CITY_ID
         INNER JOIN RADIUS R ON C.CITY_NAME = R.CITY_NAME
         GROUP BY C.CITY_ID,
         C.CITY_NAME,
         TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'Day'),
         TO_CHAR (T.REQUEST_TIMESTAMP, 'HH AM')

I tried comparing syntax between the two of them but I didn't find any difference which is surprising
