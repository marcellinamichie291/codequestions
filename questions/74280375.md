fn main() {
    let foo: String = From::from("foo");
    let foo = String::from("foo");

    let bar: Vec<u8> = foo.into();
    let bar = <String as Into<Vec<u8>>>::into(foo);
    let bar = Into::<Vec<u8>>::into(foo);
}

The above code has two sections. The first section sets foo in two different ways, and the second section sets bar in three different ways. I'd like to understand if the statements in each section are entirely the same, and which one shall be preferred in each section.
