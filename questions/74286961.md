# Convert lists into higher dimension so that elements can be reached by following

I have a matrix that I want to convert to 3D so that I can be able to print the element of list[i][j][k]
a = [[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 2, 3, 4,5], [3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4], [4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3], [5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4]]]

print(a[5][5][0]) # I want to be able to print in 3D`

I get right output if I do a[5][5] but wrong when I add the [0]. Is there anyway of converting my matrix such that this will be solved?
I tried to just wrap the list up with brackets [list], but it did not work. I also did:
b = [[i] for i in a]
which gave me [[[0,1,2,3,4,5]],[[1,2,3,4,5,6]],...
and it still did not work!
