I'm learning writing script in Maya, and sometimes my maya just crash and pop a error report(like thisâ†“)

Then I choose 'View Report Details', and it seems there should be a maya crash log in the given path. But I just can't find it. In fact, I think I got all the other stuff except the crash log. Can anybody help me find it?

Please forgive my language if there is anything incorrect for I'm not English native speaker :(
I have also just closed the window and checked the folder, but still cannot find it.
