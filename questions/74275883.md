I need to overwrite a text file into another one, while deleting lines containing palindromes
For example i have file data.txt inside which: (Anna hello, my name Is Groo How are you doing ? Are you feeling alright ?)
And get the result in file res.txt: (How are you doing ? Are you feeling alright ?) Becouse 'Anna' is palindrom
#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 
#include <algorithm> 
#include <sstream> 
#include <windows.h>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;




int main() {
    ifstream ifs("data.txt");
    if (ifs)
    {
        cout << ifs.rdbuf() << endl << endl;
        ifs.clear();
        ifs.seekg(0);

        ofstream ofs("res.txt");
        string str;
        stringstream ss;
        while (getline(ifs, str))
        {
            ss << str;
            str.clear();
            string s;
            while (ss >> s)
            {

                str.append(s);
                if (!ss.eof())
                    str.push_back(' ');

            }
            ofs << str << endl;
            ss.clear();
            ss.str("");
        }
        ifs.close();
        ofs.close();

        ifs.open("res.txt");
        cout << ifs.rdbuf() << endl << endl; 
        ifs.close();
    }
    else
        cout << "Error opening file!" << endl;
}
