# How to mint a collection of NFTs using `mintBatch` function of ERC1155 with custom URI for each collection?

I'm trying to mint multiple NFTs using mintBatch from the ERC1155 contract. However, I want to use a custom URI whenever I call mintBatch function.
Example: I mint collection1 of 10 NFTs by calling the mintBatch function with a URI. This URI will be the same for all these 10 NFTs in the collection. Next, I want to mint another collection2 of 10 NFTs using the mintBatch with a new URI. This URI should be the same for all NFTs of collection2 but should be different from the URI of collection1.
Note: I don't want to have a custom URI for each NFT, but for a collection of NFTs created using mintBatch so that all the NFTs in the collection have the same URI.
How to mint a collection of NFTs using the mintBatch function of ERC1155 in such a way that each collection should have its custom URI?
