# Removing Neovim window focus

I love the Gruvbox theme. The only problem I've ever had with it was when it started to cause a W18 warning on all of my newly opened buffers so, I finally decided to get rid of it. I've replaced it with the Tokyonight theme, but I've come across another issue: it doesn't seem to override the settings for transparency nor dim-inactive like the example config says it would. Frustrated and incompetent, I'm asking you guys at SO as a last resort if there is a way to remove the inactive pane/buffer dim using the solely the Neovim API in Lua?

Updating the Tokyonight config to the following


The above configuration resulted in this which is anything but what it's supposed to do.



This is what I expect to happen (with the statusbar visibility toggling on focus and other default behaviors)
