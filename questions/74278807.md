# Unable to install pandas profiling for python 3.6.5

I want to install pandas-profiling in my system but unable to do so.
I have ran this code in my jupyter notebook
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pandas-profiling

After that I'm trying to import pandas-profiling but giving me the below error
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport


ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas_profiling'

How should I proceed with this after installing pandas-profiling in the jupyter notebook?
