# Python multiple x,y,z values - is there a way to write them in short?

!!! >> I'm a total newbie, I opened matplotlib like 3 hours ago and self-taught myself here. If you introduce any new commands/lines, please let me know what they're called so I can look up tutorials, thanks!
Attempting to: Make a 3d plot of tracks/lines
Problem: I have a .csv files with 29 sets of x y z data points with 49 rows (time points). i.e. I'm tracking 29 particles in 3d space over 49 timepoints. The column headers ATM are "x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 ..." etc.
The 3D part is not an issue, but I'm kind of not interested in writing out 70+ lines of the same thing.
I.e. I'd rather not write:
x = points['x'].values
x2 = points['x2'].values
x3 = points['x3'].values
...
x29 = points['x29'].values

etc.
Is there a way to say "plot x1,y1,z1 to x29,y29,z29 from that .csv" instead?
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas
import numpy as np

points = pandas.read_csv('D:Documents\PYTHON_FILES/test3d.csv')

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

x = points['x'].values
y = points['y'].values
z = points['z'].values

x2 = points['x2'].values
y2 = points['y2'].values
z2 = points['z2'].values


ax.plot(x, y, z, c='red', marker='o', linewidth=1.0, markersize=2)
ax.plot(x2, y2, z2, c='blue', marker='o', linewidth=1.0, markersize=2)


plt.show()

Thanks in advance!
