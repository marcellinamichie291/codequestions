# Statically include large binary file in C++ executable in Visual Studio

I have a large binary file, ~1gb in size. I'd like to include this statically in a C++ executable compiled in Visual Studio 2019. The executable is built for Windows.
I'd like to access the binary file at runtime, but don't want to ship it alongside the application. So reading at runtime from a file is not an option.
I have seen the solution that just includes it as a byte array, but that is cumbersome, is there no better solution?
How would including it as a resource file look like?
