# How to append in a XML file using ANT?

I have an XML and ANT file. In my XML file I have a plugin tag, what I need to do is to append a plugin tag after plugin end tag.
<I have few lines of code here>
    <plugin>
    <groupId>mygroupid</groupId>
    <artifactId>tycho-sample-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>myversion</version>
    <configuration>
    <profiles>JavaSE-1.6</profiles>
    </configuration>
    **</plugin>**
<I have few lines of code here>

I have tried using  task from ANT and provided append="true", but this appends at the end of the file not after plugin. Is there some way like to add a piece of code after  tag using ANT (Highlighted the end of plugin tag, append after that) ?
