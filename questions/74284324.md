# Splitting string into a new line in apache-pig

I want to split the string in a dataset that is joined by a backslash (/) into a new line.
The example datatset is:
(David Jones / John Smith)

I want the result to be:
(David Jones)
(John Smith)

The code i have written is:
A = FOREACH data GENERATE FLATTEN(STRSPLIT(name,'/',2));
DUMP A;

However the result i'm getting in the terminal is:
(David Jones, John Smith)
