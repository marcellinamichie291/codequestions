# How to retrieve ESXi hostname where VCenter is located?

I need to find out with Ansible on which ESXi host the VCenter is located and then test the ESXi if it is accessible.
With community.vmware.vmware_vm_info I can see on which the host the VCenter VM is located. I would the just connect to that host.
This works so far but I have the feeling that this could be done smarter.
Any suggestions?
Thanks and best regards,
Haiko
