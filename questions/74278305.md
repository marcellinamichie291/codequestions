# Concurrency SQL Procedure

We have an application that uses data from the Table e.g
Product
It has product ID , available quanity

The issue is there are many separate application using this table for calculation. The issue we are having that the Available Quantity can be updated by any of them.
We have a java application that also reads from this but sometimes when it reads there was an other application already updated so we have dirty read.
What are the potential options we could use to alleviate this race condition on DB level or Java Level?
