# vs code terminal has problems with non-English chararacters

Vs Code Terminal shows non-English characters like this:

letters covering each other, is there a way to change this? on ubuntu it works just fine but on windows 10 it has this problem.
I tried to change terminal font but it didn't work. maybe I didn't try right font.
