# SAS - PROC SQL - Macro variable for between dates not working as expected

I've several queries using a MIN(startdate) and MAX(enddate).
to avoid having to calculate these every time I want to do this once at the beginning and store it in a macro variable but I get an error every time.
What is going wrong or how to achieve this ?
Thanks in advance for the help !
This works:
WHERE DATE BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(startdate format yymmddn8. FROM work.mydata) AND (SELECT MAX(enddate format yymmddn8. FROM work.mydata)

DATE format is YYMMDD8n and length is 8.
Creating macro variables:
PROC SQL;
    SELECT MIN(startdate), MAX(enddate)
    INTO :start_date, :end_date
    FROM work.mydata
QUIT;

/*Formatting the macro variable:*/
%macro format(value,format);
    %if %datatyp(&value)=CHAR
     %THEN %SYSFUNC(OUTC(&value, &format));
    %ELSE %LEFT(%QSYSFUNC(PUTN($value,&format)));
%MEND format;

Tried:
WHERE DATE BETWEEN %format(&start_date, yymmddn8.) AND %format(&end_date, yymmddn8.)

WHERE DATE BETWEEN "%format(&start_date, yymmddn8.)" AND "%format(&end_date, yymmddn8.)"
    

Error message:
ERROR: Expression using equals (=) has components that are of different data types
