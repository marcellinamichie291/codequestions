# Calculate width of a line depending on a number with a base of 50 %

I want to increase the width of a line depending on a number (0 - 10). The width of the line should not be bigger 50 % since I set either left: 50% or right: 50% to the line to let it move to the right or left depending on a second parameter:


#line {
  height: 10px;
  background: gray;
  position: relative;
}

#line::after {
  content: '';
  height: 10px;
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  width: 25%;
  background: red;
  right: 50%;
}
<div id="line"></div>



Within my example, I set the width to 25 % which results in an active line in the center of the left part.
Instead, I want to use CSS calc() within PHP to calculate the width by a given variable:
width: calc(50% / <?= $number ?>);

The number can hold values (stepping of 1) up to 10 which should result in a full line (50 % = 100 %) of the left part, 5 the half and so on. 0 means no width.
I'm not sure if this is possible this way? I've tried dividing them, which seems to be the right direction but not the full deal.
