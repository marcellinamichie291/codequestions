# My linked image in CSS is not displaying in my div and the file path is correct

I created a div with a .section class in HTML where I want to display my image and linked the file path in CSS by setting the background image of the class with url(‘./images/myfilepath’) and set the background-size: cover with  width: 100% and height: auto but it’s still not displayed.
I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling VS Code but the problem still persists, and I downloaded another VS Code but it’s still the same; not loading my image in my <div> tag.
