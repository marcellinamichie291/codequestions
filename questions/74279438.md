So i had this code as my basic (i got this from ytb)
Sub Preview_Button()
Dim awal, Akhir, Numberpick As Integer
awal = Range("N6").Value
Akhir = Range("O6").Value
Numberpick = Range("M4").Value = .Range("Q4") + 5
If awal <= Akhir And awal >= 1 Then
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    For a = awal To Akhir
        With Sheets("Print Out")
            .Range("N4").Value = a
            .Range("O4").Value = a + 1
            .Range("P4").Value = a + 2
            .Range("Q4").Value = a + 3
            .PrintPreview
        End With
    Next a
Else
    MsgBox "Cek lagi Nomor yang akan dicetak...!!!!", vbCritical, "Cetak Halaman"
End If
End Sub
