# Swift - Creating a new nested array based on the date values of an array consisting of a model

There is an array of users coming from the database.
struct Model {
    var name: String
    var date: String
}

let data: [Model] = [
    Model(name: "Mick", date: "12.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Donald", date: "12.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Melissa", date: "07.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Kerem", date: "12.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Caren", date: "24.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Jhon", date: "07.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Miles", date: "19.09.2022"),
    Model(name: "Rick", date: "19.09.2022"),
]

What I want is to create a new array by grouping the ones with the same date.
The array I want:
let groupedData: [[Model]] = [
    [
        Model(name: "Caren", date: "24.09.2022")
    ],
    [
        Model(name: "Rick", date: "19.09.2022"),
        Model(name: "Miles", date: "19.09.2022")
    ],
    [
        Model(name: "Mick", date: "12.09.2022"),
        Model(name: "Donald", date: "12.09.2022"),
        Model(name: "Kerem", date: "12.09.2022")
    ],
    [
        Model(name: "Jhon", date: "07.09.2022"),
        Model(name: "Melissa", date: "07.09.2022")
    ]

]

I tried to enter the master array with the for loop, but I could not come to any conclusion because the size of the future data is variable.
