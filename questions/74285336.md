# Issue while using apollo client with react "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')"

I am following this guide to use apollo client in react using Apollo Provider but I am getting an issue described below:
react.development.js:1618 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
    at useContext (react.development.js:1618:1)
    at useApolloClient (useApolloClient.ts:9:1)
    at useQuery (useQuery.ts:48:1)
    at UserAlias (UserAlias.tsx:21:1)
    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.development.js:14803:1)
    at mountIndeterminateComponent (react-dom.development.js:17482:1)
    at beginWork (react-dom.development.js:18596:1)
    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:188:1)
    at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (react-dom.development.js:237:1)
    at invokeGuardedCallback (react-dom.development.js:292:1)

When making the query directly through apollo client it is working fine but when doing it through apollo provider it is throwing the above error.
Any reference would be appreciated.
