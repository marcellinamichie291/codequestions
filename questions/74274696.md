# How do I safely terminate a state in an asynchronous event-driven finite state machine (in python)

I am working on an event-driven state machine. An event handler processes incoming events continuously (while true) in its own thread. Depending on the current state, all possible transitions are checked and a state transition is executed if the event matches.
Only the task in the current state is to be executed, therefore with a state transition first the execution of the old state is terminated and then the new state is executed. Since I want to asynchronously terminate a state with a STOP event, the execution of a state runs on a separate thread. However, I have now found out that threads cannot be terminated (also makes sense in order not to generate unsafe states). It would therefore be very nice if I could interrupt the execution of a thread (similar to handling exceptions) by a signal to establish a safe state. Is it possible to throw an exception in a thread externally for this?
from time import sleep
from threading import Thread

class StopEvent(Exception):
    pass

class State:
    def _task(self):
        # Will be executed within the thread
        print("Starting state ...")
        try:
            for i in range(10):
                print(i)
                sleep(0.5)
        except StopEvent:
            print("Establish safe state.")
        print("Terminate state ...")

    def run_task(self):
        self._thread = Thread(target=self._task)
        self._thread.start()
    
    def stop_task(self):
        raise StopEvent

state = State()
state.run_task()
sleep(2)
state.stop_task()

I have only tried the threading package so far. Multiprocessing would give me the possibility to terminate the process, but then the system also can be in an unsafe state.
I first had the idea to terminate the state task thread via a thread daemon, but this only works if the entire program ends.
