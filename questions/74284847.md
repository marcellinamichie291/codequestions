# How to create a new user with a set of permissions on AWS RDS mariadb read replica?

I have a mariadb AWS RDS. For giving access to my data analytics team, I created a read replica. I can set master password in the AWS RDS console. I did this so that password for main standalone DB is different from read replica password. This is fine.
Now I want to control the read access to certain schemas (databases). I want to create new users and grant specific permissions on specific databases. How do I create a new user on read replica and grant desired permissions.
