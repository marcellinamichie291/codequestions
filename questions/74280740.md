# How to wait multiple times in one function? (Kotlin)

I'm trying to make a code that will wait one second before switching something, wait one more second and switch again?
I tried using Thread.Sleep() and Delay() but both of them just skip to the final result
(If I have img1 and img2, it will not show img1 but instantly freeze everything and show img2 after all the delays are done)
How can I make it wait, run a line, wait again, run another line without it just freezing the app and showing the final result?
