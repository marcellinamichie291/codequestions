# inside and out side for loops difference

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
for k in range(3):
    temp = a[len(a) - 1]
    i = len(a)-1
    while i >= 1:
        a[i] = a[i-1]
        i -= 1
    a[0] = temp
print(a)

rotating array by K.
I have a doubt regarding to LOOPS , If I assign the temp variable and variable i outside the for loop the temp variable is constant and  need to decrement i by i -= 1,but when they are inside the for loop even  decrementing the variable i is same in the next iteration and temp is not constant .why ??
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
temp = a[len(a) - 1]
i = len(a) -1
for k in range(3):
    while i >= 1:
        a[i] = a[i-1]
        i -= 1
    i = len(a)-1
    a[0] = temp
print(a)
