# PHP code is not being executed, but the code shows in the browser source code

I'm trying to execute some PHP code on a project (using Dreamweaver) but the code isn't being run.
When I check the source code, the PHP code appears as HTML tags (I can see it in the source code). Apache is running properly (I'm working with XAMPP), the PHP pages are being opened properly but the PHP code isn't being executed.
Does someone have a suggestion about what is happening?
Note: The file is already named as filename.php
Edit:
The Code..:
<?
include_once("/code/configs.php");
?>
