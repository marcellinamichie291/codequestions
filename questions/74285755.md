# Can a foreign key be primary key in the same table?

I have a table A with a primary key Aapk, a table B with primary key Bapk, and a table C. Can these two keys (Aapk and Bapk) be at the same time foreign keys and primary key in the table C?
Example:

Table A is the table "Course", table B is the table "section" and the table C is the table "Class".
