# Creating matrix with values 1-4 in a random placement with limitations

I have an experiment where we are going to plant 4 different bushes in two different sized square plantings (8x8 bushes and 12x12 bushes) and we want their placement in the plantings to be randomized. I thought of trying to create a matrix in R for this purpose, since it's the software I'm used to. The issue is that the randomization has to follow a few limitations, and I’m not that experienced in creating matrices. The limitations are:

There has to be one of each species in each corner of the planting.
The two outer rows in the square has to contain an equal amount of each species.
The inner 4x4 quadrant in the square has to contain an equal amount of each species.
Plants of the same species can’t be planted next each other, but if they are placed on the diagonal of each other it’s fine.
I hope the issue is clear, otherwise ask!
