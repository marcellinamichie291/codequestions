# Counting all the 5 from a specific range in Bash

I want to count how many times the digit "5" appears from the range 1 to 4321. For example, the number 5 appears 1 or the number 555, 5 would appear 3 times etc.
Here is my code so far, however, the results are 0, and they are supposed to be 1262.
#!/bin/bash
typeset -i count5=0
for n in {1..4321}; do
        echo ${n}
done | \
     while read -n1 digit ; do
        if [ `echo "${digit}" | grep 5` ] ; then
                count5=count5+1
        fi
     done | echo "${count5}"

P.s. I am looking to fix my code so it can print the right output. I do not want a completely different solution or a shortcut.
