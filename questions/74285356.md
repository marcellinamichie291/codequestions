# How can we create separate Spring Boot app for users and admin but admin can access all the functionalities of users

I'm working on a project which requires a separate spring boot app for admin and users but admin can access all the functionalities of user application, React App use used in the front-end. To demonstrate scalability each user will have a separate database and application running on different server, admin will have a separate server with its application and database. Admin can create new user anytime and that should create a server and setup database with some default data and put spring app on server and run it. What architecture or technologies should I use to achieve this? Severs here can be like Droplets of DigitalOcean.
I'm considering using an api gateway and discovery service running each on a different droplet to handle routing but how can I creation of new users, DigitalOcean has a REST API to using which I can create a droplet but how can I setup database on it. Or is it a bad approach for it problem?
