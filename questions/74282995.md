# Child UIScrollview Not Receiving Scroll or TapGesture events

I have a UITableViewCell which has a child Scrollview. The scrollview has not been scrolling even with its content size much bigger than the frame (and with subviews to fill it).I then wanted to verify if it was even receiving touch events and it turns out its not. The parent view is receiving the tap gesture and printing but the scrollview is not.
A few other facts about the scrollview:

I verified its frame and contentview at runtime and the content view is much bigger than the frame
I've explicitly set isUserInteractionEnabled to true
On my tests I set the tap gestures to not swallow the touch event

Here is the code where I create it, I welcome any and all suggestions as to why the scrollview is not getting touch events.
    func initWith(items: [UIView], title: String, enclosingScrollview: UIView) {
        frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 260, height: 216)
        backgroundColor = .yellow
        selectionStyle = .none
        
        let scrollviewFrame = CGRect(x: leftOffset, y: 56, width: enclosingScrollview.frame.width, height: 160)
        scrollview = UIScrollView(frame: scrollviewFrame)
        scrollview.backgroundColor = .red
        
        let offset: CGFloat = 16
        var itemWidthSize: CGFloat = 0
        for i in 0..<items.count {
            let item = items[i]
            scrollview.addSubview(item)
            let leftOffset = CGFloat(i) * (item.frame.width + offset)
            item.frame = CGRect(x: leftOffset, y: 0, width: item.frame.width, height: item.frame.height)
            itemWidthSize += leftOffset + item.frame.width
        }
        scrollview.contentSize = CGSize(width: itemWidthSize, height: frame.height) // Valid size results and is much bigger than frame width
        
        addSubview(titleLabel)
        addSubview(scrollview)
        bringSubviewToFront(scrollview)
        
// Tap gestures added for testing why scrollview not scrolling
        let tap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(tapped))
        scrollview.addGestureRecognizer(tap)
        scrollview.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
        tap.cancelsTouchesInView = false
        isUserInteractionEnabled = true
        
        let tap2 = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(tapped2))
        tap2.cancelsTouchesInView = false
        addGestureRecognizer(tap2)
    }
    
    @objc func tapped() {
        print("b") // Called
    }
    
    @objc func tapped2() {
        print("a") // Never called
    }
