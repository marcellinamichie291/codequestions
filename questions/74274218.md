# How to stop Animate.css animation after one scroll in Rect.js?

I'm using react-on-screen and Animate.css to create slideInUp animation on scroll. But I want to the animation to show up when the page is loaded and the scroll-down happened. Now in my code, the animation happens every time I scroll up and down. How do I prevent that? Additional to that, if there is any way to do it without using Animate.css or react-on-screen I would love to learn it.
Here is the code that I track scrolling and Animate.css:
    <>
        <div className={`container mb-5 `}>
          <h1 className='text-center my-5 blue-text'>SOME HEADER</h1>
          
         <TrackVisibility partialVisibility>
            {({ isVisible }) => 
              <div className={`row animated-row my-element ${isVisible  ? "animate__animated animate__slideInUp animate__repeat-1 my-element" :""}`}   >
                <Card />
                <Card />
                <Card />
                <Card />
            </div>
            }
        </TrackVisibility>  
    </div>
   
</>

I saw the "Usage with Javascript" codes on the Animate.css main page but I couldn't apply them to my React code.
Thanks.
