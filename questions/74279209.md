# Cloud Flare pages with Php Laravel

I want to deploy a static site without github integration in cloudflare pages. I have searched too many blogs or documentation on this but every blog is specified with GitHub. Through CLI it's possible because it's taking the login AUTH in CLI but with Php ,I don't know that how to do this. Can you please help me with this??
