# How to add switch to UIView?

I have a UIView with gestures added, how can I have switch-like functionality?
this is my code

@objc func funcName(_ sender: Any) {
        
        if (sender as AnyObject).isOn == true{
            print("It's on")
            
            
            AppearanceService.shared.theme = Themes.light
            view.window?.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = AppearanceService.shared.theme.getUserInterfaceStyle()
            
            
        }else{
            print("It's off")
            
            
            
            AppearanceService.shared.theme = Themes.dark
            view.window?.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = AppearanceService.shared.theme.getUserInterfaceStyle()
            
        }
    }
