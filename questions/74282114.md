# Angular routing on apache is returning File not Found

I'm using the PathLocationStrategy and deployed my angular14 application on apache. My angular application files are inside the folder "test", which is inside the folder "public_html".
so folder path looks like this: /var/www/game_sites/public_html/test
I have changed the .htaccess file that is inside the "public_html" and I'm still getting File Not found.
My base ref looks like so:
<base href="/teste/">

Rewrite Rule in .htaccess file.
RewriteEngine On
  # If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is 
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d
  RewriteRule ^ - [L]
  # If the requested resource doesn't exist, use index.html
RewriteRule ^/index.html

What am i doing wrong please? I'm guessing maybe the ReWrite rule is wrong?
I have tried updating the rewrite rule and changed to useHash but to no avail
