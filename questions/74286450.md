# Docker file TLJH privileged access

In the following tutorial for installing TLJH on a docker:
https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/contributing/dev-setup.html
The docker file has privileged access:
  --privileged \

Does anyone know why? Is it necessary to let the docker running TLJH have root access to the host machine?
