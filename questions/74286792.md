# How to get any token price (ERC20) according to a block number or timestamp?

I am trying to get price of a token in a range of blocks or timestamp using the Uniswap V2 subgraph. (https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2)
Here is the query I try:
{
  tokens( where:{id:"0x6070c2215a18cd8efaf340166876ac9ce4d1e79b"},  first: 10, orderBy: txCount) {
    id,
    symbol,
    name,
    totalSupply,
    derivedETH
    txCount
  }
}

The exact thing that I try to get is, price of the X token in Y timestamp but the query above does not return as I expect. (I couldn't understand why)
Thanks in advance
