# How to find if two XML files are same and if not will I be able to Identify the mismatched fields using python?

The given below is my current code
from lxml import etree

tree1 = etree.parse('sample1.xml')
tree2 = etree.parse('sample2.xml')

set1 = set(etree.tostring(i, method='c14n') for i in tree1.getroot())
set2 = set(etree.tostring(i, method='c14n') for i in tree2.getroot())

print(set1 == set2)

Here it just prints "True" if the xml files are same and "False" if they are not equal.
What I am trying to do is to find the fields or places where the data is showing mismatch. both the files will be equal eventually. But if the files have any difference in the data's, I need to know where all there is differences.
