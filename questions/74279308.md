# pip conflict with the backend dependencies

Started since yesterday morning, I keep getting this error when I tried to "pip-install" couchbase:

ERROR: Some build dependencies for couchbase==3.2.7 from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e3/b1/b77badb03e77a9ee9e20c6b9a4374e892aaaffa80600e3287f9567d7fde8/couchbase-3.2.7.tar.gz#sha256=76d9c81197b55d04890f9834f5c4599888f58f1bfeaba50a708d659b920f8dae (from -r requirements.txt (line 6)) conflict with the backend dependencies: typing-extensions==4.4.0 is incompatible with typing-extensions==3.7.4.3; python_version<"3.8".

I have no idea why typing-extensions now requires 4.4.0 version.
I tried adding typing-extensions==3.7.4.3 to requirements.txt file and it didn't help.
I removed all other packages from requirements.txt file and only had couchbase==3.2.7 and I still got the same error.
Tried this on macOS with Python version is 3.7.15.
