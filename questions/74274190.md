# zsh command not saving as alias

I use CDK to deploy infra to AWS. I work in multiple projects and have a sequence of commands that I use to update the packages in the project.
npx ncu -u && `rm package-lock.json && rm -Rf ./node_modules && npm install` || npm install

what it's doing:

checks the versioning of the packages currently installed in the project.
attempts to remove package-lock.json file and ./node_modules dir; then install updates
if deletion of files cails, assumes they are not there and attempts to install updates

This command works fine when I execute it in a terminal, but I get the following error when trying to save it as an alias:
alias:
alias cdku="npx ncu -u && `rm package-lock.json && rm -Rf ./node_modules && npm install` || npm install"

error:
zsh: parse error near `||'

Is there a nice oneliner way to create this alias or would I be better creating an alias for rm package-lock.json && rm -Rf ./node_modules && npm install and then reference that in the alias I am trying to make?
Thanks in advance for your help.
