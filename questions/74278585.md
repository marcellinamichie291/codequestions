# How to style A tag without styling also IMG tag inside?

I am trying to use "border-bottom: 3px #ffa5af solid;" in the a tags inside our blog post, but the style is also applied to the image tag that is linked. How can I style only the text-links like this site: https://www.amandocozinhar.com/2022/10/receitas-de-pudim.html ?
Bellow is an image of the style being applied also to the images.
