# Does the async attribute block the page content?

My question is related to async attribute in script tag.
In the https://javascript.info/script-async-defer link, I can see "The page content shows up immediately: async doesnâ€™t block it."
But as far I understand, if we use the async attribute, fetching the script will happen in parallel but executing the script will block HTML parsing. So obviously page content will be blocked by the async attribute.
Can someone clarify what goes wrong in my understanding? will async block the page content?
