# Concourse Pipeline - send an HTML email

Bonjour !
I use a Concourse pipeline with my PowerShell script.
In my PowerShell script, I build a functionnal HTML file.
In the pipeline, I send an email.
I would like the HTML file directly in the body.
Here is what I do now :
resources:
  - name: send-email
    icon: email
    type: email
    source:
      smtp:
        host: ((smtp-server))
        port: "((smtp-port))"
        anonymous: true
      from: ((from-mail))
      to: ((to-mail))

      - put: send-email
        params:
          subject_text: "Pipeline job ${BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME} - ${BUILD_JOB_NAME} - ${BUILD_ID} ended"
          inline_css: false
          body: backup/body.html
          attachment_globs: ["backup/Results.zip","backup/body.html"]


I have the attachments joined.
But in my email body, I have all the le HTML code in one line
How can I do to have the right HTML result on the email body ?
Thanks !
