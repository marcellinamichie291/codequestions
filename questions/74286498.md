# Set custom breakpoints in long String during dynamic resize

I have a string of text that dynamically resizes. At its core its basically a Text widget in a SizedBox in a Column.
When it resizes, the words wrap to the next as you typically expect...it breaks to the next line by using the 'SPACES' between words (as opposed to breaking up words character by character).
However, an email address can be a very long string without spaces. When it no longer fits within the bounds of the box it begins to resize itself by breaking on individual characters and moving into the next line.
It's a minor issue, but not visually appealing.
How might one create breakpoints within the String to resize itself by wrapping to the next line based on custom characters? For example, in an email address I'd prefer it break on the '@' and/or '.' before resorting to breaking up the String on individual characters.
