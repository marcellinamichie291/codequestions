# Is it possible to move SecurityStamp column to another table (other than AspNetUsers)

It looks like it's possible to ignore certain columns, like this.
However, if I don't want to totally ignore, e.g. SecurityStamp column, but to move it to a separate table. Is it possible through configuration?
