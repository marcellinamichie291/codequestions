# Container Failing to deploy on GKE

I have a container written in go. It deploys and runs on my DockerDesktop & on my Kubernetes cluster in DockerDesktop.
I have pushed the same container to Artefact Repository and it fails to deploy.
So I deployed it to CloudRun, and it works! Very confused.
My GKE cluster is autopilot so I assume the are no resource issues.
I expected to get a running container however i got
Cannot schedule pods: Insufficient cpu.
PodUnschedulable
Reason
Cannot schedule pods: Insufficient cpu.
