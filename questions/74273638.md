# Getting photo dimension of locally stored photo

I'd like to know photos width and height before loading a bitmap. I'm using latest approach of ContentResolver to query locally stored photos.
        contentResolver.query(
            collection,
            projection,
            selection,
            selectionArgs,
            sortOrder
        )!!.use { cursor ->
            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
                // Use an ID column from the projection to get
                // a URI representing the media item itself.
                val idColumn = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Images.Media._ID)
                val widthColumn = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Images.Media.WIDTH)

                val id: Long = cursor.getLong(idColumn)
                val width: Int = cursor.getInt(widthColumn) //CRASH                    
            }

Cursor is crashing on the selected line width:
IllegalStateException: Couldn't read row 0, col -1 from CursorWindow.  Make sure the Cursor is initialized correctly before accessing data from it.

How am I supposed to do that then?
