# Retrieving ALL the facet search values - impossible?

Seems that there is a limit of retrieving only 1000 values per facet from the AzureSearch api.  Is there any way to overcome this?  We just want to run a report listing the values/counts per facet.  We do not need the actual documents returned for this report.
Looks like our only alternative is to query the database, but with all the money we're spending on AzureSearch it's disappointing to not find an easy solution.
