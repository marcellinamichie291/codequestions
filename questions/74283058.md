# syscall: 'write', code: 'EPROTO', errno: -4046, or AxiosError: read ECONNRESET

I am trying to test out using proxies for the first time in my coding career and been trying for a while now. However I keep getting this weird error that doesnt make any sense in my head. The proxy I use here is taken from http://free-proxy.cz/en/proxylist/country/US/https/date/all. I have no problem paying for some proxy servers I just wanna make sure it works before paying for anything.
However I keep getting the error AxiosError: read ECONNRESET OR AxiosError: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established OR write EPROTO E0DA0000:error:0A00010B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number:c:\ws\deps\openssl\openssl\ssl\record\ssl3_record.c:355:
I am running the code on Localhost so my connection to the proxy server is not https.
Here is the code I am trying to excecute. I have imported
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

But this clearly is not the problem.
router.get("/userInvTest", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const axiosDefaultConfig = {
            proxy: false,
            httpsAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent('https://205.134.235.132:3129'),
        };
        const axiosUse = require('axios').create(axiosDefaultConfig);
        const steamInventory = await axiosUse.get("https://steamcommunity.com/inventory/76561198027016127/730/2?l=english&count=5000");
        console.log(steamInventory.data)
        res.status(200).send(steamInventory.data)
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
})
