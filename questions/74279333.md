# why does php crypt function with hash return hash

I recently inherited a legacy php project that rolled it's own auth using the crypt function. I'm working on reverse engineering it but don't quite understand how this works.
the code to save this password looks like the following
$pass = crypt('password') // no salt. This result is saved to password col of user table


To verify the password hash, the app first pulls the hash from the DB then verifies it against the hash something like this

$pass = get_submitted_password()

$hash = get_the_hash_from_database()

return $hash == crypt($pass, $hash)   // the hash is used as the salt

The app is 5.* but i've verified that this snippet of code still works on php 8.1. Can someone explain how/why this works?
