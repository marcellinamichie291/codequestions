# Dental clinic database design - teeth

I am designing a database for dental dentistry. I do not know if I have designed the database correctly.
I named it TYPE OF TOOTH because there are baby teeth, permanent teeth
I named it JAW, because there are upper jaw, lower jaw and both
I named it TEETH, because there are teeth number 1, 2, 3, 4....
TYPE OF TOOTH (N:N) with JAW: TYPEs OF TOOTH (Baby teeth will have upper jaw, lower jaw) in contrast, TEETH will belong to many types of teeth (upper and lower jaw both have baby teeth and permanent teeth).
JAW (N:N) with TEETH: There will be many teeth (the upper jaw will have teeth number 1, 2, ,3, 4) and vice versa (tooth number 1,2,3,4 belongs to the lower jaw of baby teeth or tooth number 4,5 3,6,7,8 belong to the lower jaw of the permanent teeth).
