# How to send/store dataframe from R to Neo4j Database using "neo4r" package?

I've managed to connect R to Neo4j via neo4r package using the following code
library(neo4r)
con <- neo4j_api$new(
  url = "http://localhost:11004",
  user = "neo4j", 
  password = "helloneo4j"
)

Now, I would like to store dataframes from R to Neo4j, how to do that?
