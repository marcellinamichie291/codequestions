# Flutter Riverpod - `ref.listen` callback triggers even when not updating the state

I am using ref.listen method inside the top statelesswidget (this widget's build method returns MaterialApp widget) to navigate user to login page if state changes to unauthenticated.
The problem is listen method calls its callback function whenever I hot reload the app. This shouldn't be happening. The real behavior I expect is callback function triggering only when state is changed.

I have confirmed that the state of authNotifierProvider isn't updating unless Triggering Hot Restart or by pressing login button inside LoginRoute
