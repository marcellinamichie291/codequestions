# Linq to SQL Dynamic Where Clause

I have a simple query:
dim res = (From x In db.INVENTORies
         Where x.INVENTORY_ACTIVATION_DATE IsNot Nothing).count

I need to run this for 14 different date fields, so how do I run this where INVENTORY_ACTIVATION_DATE can be a variable/dynamic?
something like:
function GetCount(aField as string) as integer
return (From x In db.INVENTORies
        Where x.**<Use aField here>** IsNot Nothing).count

end function
Thanks in advance.

I've tried Dynamic Linq and PredicateBuilder, but there are no good examples for my scenario.
