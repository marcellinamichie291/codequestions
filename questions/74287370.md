# NFS daemon starts failed

I trid to host the window as the NFS server using WinNFSd
text
I suecess to use a specific file to share when first time to use it. However it display this message after I close cmd and use WinNFSd again:
Path #1 is: C:\NFS\share, path alias is: /share
Portmap daemon started
NFS daemon starts failed.

How to solve it ?
I did some research, the reason may be having a hidden daemon running
if it is true, I can I kill the daemon?
