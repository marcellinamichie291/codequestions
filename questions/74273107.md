# How to modify the Handle order in the UEFI Handle Database?

In the code, the following boot service is being used to obtain an array of Handles with the array size equals HandleCount.
gBS->LocateHandleBuffer (
                ByProtocol,
                &gEfiSomeProtocolGuid,
                NULL,
                &HandleCount,
                &Handles
                );

I was expecting a particular order of the array of Handles I can get after this boot service call. Let's say this represents the EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL. The system connects to 3 video cards and I want to ensure the GeForce RTXâ„¢ 3090 is always loaded before 3070, and then 3060. How do I trace the source of this Handles array to modify the handle database?
