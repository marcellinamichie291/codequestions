# How to get a id value of tables in postgres

How to get a unique, identical value of a table?
For example, if there are tables like 't_aa', 't_bb', 't_cc', I want a result like below.
id   |   table_name
-------------------
1    |    't_aa'
2    |    't_bb'
3    |    't_cc'

What I exactly want is to get a specific, and unique number from the name of tables.
I have tried
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;

-- or

SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;

but this doesn't provide any identical numbers to me.
I hope there is some way to get results like above by using some lines of query,
but if I really have to make a new table for this, that could be okay as an alternative.
please help me, thank you
