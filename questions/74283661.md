# Pattern substitution and delete the resulting line

I need to substitute a pattern, let's say  (the symbols need to be too) to a NULL string.
If this results in an empty line, the line should be deleted. It explicitly says that curly brackets may be needed to make this happen, and here is where I get stuck.
I can easily substitute the pattern but not delete it as the "s" command in sed does not accept my syntax:
This is what I tried:
sed 's/<"patern">//{/g/d}' file.txt   

Edited: I put it like this because it gets it like an HTML header.
Maybe the curly brackets are to specify somehow if the resulting line from substituting is empty do something else?
