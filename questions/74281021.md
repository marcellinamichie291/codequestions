# Hide records that are not matching search box filter

I am using MS Access 2010.
I have a table named "Dashboard"
I have a field named "Client Name"
In my tab named "Search Form" I have a subform called "Dashboard_subform"
The code is working corectly but I have two minor issues:
1. When combo box is empty and i press enter then Run-time error "Extra ) in query expression '([Client Name] = )'.
2. All records are showing up when the combo box is empty. I want no records to show up until i search the particular field data is typed in the combo box. Only records matching the data typed in the combo box must be listed.
Private Sub SearchClientRecords_AfterUpdate()

    Me.SearchClientRecords.AutoExpand = False

    Dim myclient As String

    myclient = "Select * from [Dashboard] where ([Client Name] = " & Me.SearchClientRecords & ")"

    Me.Dashboard_subform.Form.RecordSource = myclient

    Me.Dashboard_subform.Form.Requery

End Sub

I assumed "AutoExpand" False will hide all records until a entry is typed in the combo box.
Also not sure why the run time error is showing up because the closed paranthesis is needed in this case.
