# Close all webdriver sessions using Python

I am running a Flask server and I have the following problem.
When an user login in, a Selenium webdriver is initialized and performs some task. It store some cookies and then it communicates with frontend (I can't control WHEN it will save the cookies and I cannot close it with driver.close(). After this I need to start again the chromedriver but preserving the cookies (I'm using User dir for this reason and this works).
The problem is that the second time I start the webdriver I get error because the previous one is not closed. How can I close it before starting a new one, using Python?
Thanks!
I expect to close all the active chromedriver sessions without using Selenium (I cannot use it), but using Python.
