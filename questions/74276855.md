# Finding specific array or list in a numpy array

I have a list of numpy arrays, which consists of all possible configurations of 0 and 1 in a 10-pixel arrays. I'm trying to determine the number of arrays that have specific group of 1s for more than two 1s. For example, the array is [1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1]. I want to determine this array has five 1s as a block. Another example, the array is [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. I want to find the block as six 1s instead of three 1s block. I couldn't find a way to do this.
Here is the code I generate the list of all possible arrays:
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

all_arrays = np.array(list(product([0,1], repeat=10)))
