I have created one object and I want to store multiple arrays in the same object how can I do it? when I click on save I need an array in the object, I have tried arry_push but it could not work for me.

when we click on submit need store every time.e array in the single object. I have created the object but I'm not getting everything array in the same object.

see below my object
{"hotelId":"1","hotelName":"Hotel Bharat","pos":"nl","hoteldetail":[{"room_type":"2","mealplan":"99","ex_adult":"0","ex_child_with_bed":"0","ex_child_without_bed":"0","infant":"0"}],"addondetail":{"1411":{"couple":"0"}}}
