# Adobee illustrator just crashed, data recovery was on but it's a bunch of seemingly corrupted files. How can I recover my files?

I am using a Windows 11 laptop.
Adobe illustrator crashed while I was working on a drawing. There was no pop ur or anything, the application just froze and closed. Data recovery was turned on and should back up every 2 minutes. However every single file in data recovery is just a bunch of random characters. When I attempt to open it I just get an error that the file type isn't supported.
The files have names like: "ed300414-e34d-461f-9c40-e35173755706" without any file format. adding a .ai at the end still gives the same error.
here's the first 20 lines of one of the files opened in notepad:

How can I recover my work?
I tried to open the files from the reovery directory with illustrator, expecting my original file. However I got an error that said the file type was not supported.
Then I tried adding .ai as the file extention but that gave me the same error.
