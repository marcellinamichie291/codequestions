For the project i am working on i need to capture webcam in real-time. I want to show real-time web cam captured frames in slow motions like in different picture box. Real-time in picture box, slow motion in picture box 2. I think i need to use EmguCV, functions capture and query frames but i do nÄ±t know how to start.
Please give me any suggestion, any tutorials step by step. I am quite new to C# and image processing so do not hesitate to show me any basic tutorials.
