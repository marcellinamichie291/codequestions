# Nestjs with Heroku : Error R15 (Memory quota vastly exceeded)

I successfully deploy a backend application using Nestjs technology on heroku. Then I added the twilio service to the project to send sms and the deployment no longer works. In the console I get the error:
Process running mem=973M(190.2%)
Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded)
Stopping all processes with SIGTERM
Process exited with status 143
I tried several solutions without success including the command:
heroku config:set NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=2560"
