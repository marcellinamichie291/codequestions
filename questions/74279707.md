# MS VBA: Why is my nested if statement in a case statement not executing the code based on the combo box value?

I have built the foundation and most of the functionality for a user-form that is supposed to allow a user to pick a category of data and move the cell references of that data between two different options. I have three separate sales categories to select from as the main data in the tables where they are stored. Additionally, for reference, I have a fourth and final category that moves all of the previous three categories at once. So essentially, I have four category selections in a combo box to move the data from a cell for "not-shipping" and "shipping" data for sales. I am using the formula functions for the box to move the data between locations. However, for some reason, I have not been able to get any iteration of my nested statements to work.
If the data is also present in the other shipping status (not shipping change to shipping and vice versa), it deletes the cell reference in the formula with a find and replace statement using strings. I have four option buttons as well that set parameters for time period and the likelihood of shipping. I also have exception handling if statements that flag the cell if the data is already present in one of them so that it doesn't double-count my data. It should send a warning message saying the data is already there.
I have tried changing the basic outline of the nested statements from if/elseif/end if to a SELECT Case case is = "sales category" end select layout. My biggest issue is getting the nested statements to trigger when the prescribed event takes place (either moves the cell reference to the new cell or flags it as already being in that location).  Theoretically, it should function exactly like the other three.
I have truncated the code to show a basic overview of the data since the actual code is very long and can be cumbersome to read through.

I have the exact same sort of layout for a month period table as well. Note: by table, I do not mean that it the table is one of excel's especially formatted tables with built-in filtering. Mine are just formatted to look like a generic table.
Here is the code for the combo box that is initialized when the user-form is opened up. I do not have them hard-coded in a spreadsheet so if that is a problem, I would love some guidance on making those changes.
`
```
`
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim wb As ThisWorkbook
    Dim strfilename As String
    Dim ctrlType1 As String

    strfilename = "C:\Users\user-name\~.xlsm"

    Set wb = Workbooks.Open(strfilename)

    Set ws = Worksheets(1)

    ws.Activate

    With AddinSales
       .AddItem "Select an Option"
       .AddItem "Sales Category 1"
       .AddItem "Sales Category 2"
       .AddItem "Sales Category 3"
       .AddItem "All Sales Categories"
   
        If AddinSales.Value = Null Then
            AddinSales.Value = "Select an Option"
        End If
    
        .DropButtonStyle = fmDropButtonStylePlain
    End With
End Sub`
