# Writing DWORD to end of file on Windows

I am trying to figure out how to write a integer value to the end of my file. The value is size.
DWORD size = 12314432;
BOOL ret = WriteFile(hFile, size, sizeof(DWORD), NULL, NULL);

However WriteFile() requires that parameter 3 be of type LPCVOID so I am not sure how I would give it the DWORD instead.
I have tried..
unsigned char b[sizeof(DWORD)] = {0};
sprintf(b, "%d", size);
WriteFile(hFile, b, sizeof(DWORD), NULL, NULL);

However this just puts the hex value of each digit. So if size=1234 then it would write "31 32 33 44" to end of the file.
I would like the end of the file to just get the number in 4 bytes.
