# How can I solve this issue nInvalid `db.user.create()`?

when I try to store data in DB its getting an error like this
"Error: \nInvalid `db.user.create()` invocation 

.

const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const db = new PrismaClient();

function createUserByEmailAndPassword(user) {
  user.password = bcrypt.hashSync(user.password, 12);
  return db.user.create({
    data: user,
  });
}

I try to change the importing method of the Prisma client but that is not a solution for that. I want a better method to solve this.
