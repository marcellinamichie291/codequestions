# There isn't any debug in my code but Webstorm says there is a debug

I'm getting below error when trying to send commit. I checked everything and there isn't any debug in my code but still getting the error. Is there any solution for it ?

I tried to check left side of webstorm to be sure there isnt any red circle(debug).
I expect to send code as a commit.
