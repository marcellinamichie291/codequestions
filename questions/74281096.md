# Is there a Way of telling Appleskript to Open Mission control > Screen Mirroring > Select ipad?

So currently I am working on a Macbook Pro which Screen is cracked! the problem is I need to somehow execute a skript that i can activate with the Touchbar of my macbook to tell To

open the Mission Control
Select the Screen Mirroring
Select the Ipad.

Is there any way?
otherwise the Same Would be

Apple Symbol
system settings
Display
click on the plus icon
Select ipad

i am really new to skripting or coding!
But I would be really grateful about some useful links or starting points!
I tried to find some other ways, but the other ways are outdated...According to the skripts I haven't found any thing which brings me closer to solve my problem.
I downloaded a screen mirroring app, but i think there must be a shorter way to use this feature...
Thanks in advance!
