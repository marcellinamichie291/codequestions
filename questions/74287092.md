# PromQL join a metric with a group left with another metric resticted by a boolean condition

I need to join a metric m1 with a metric m2 where m2 is filtered, something like
m1 > on(...) group left m2 > xxxx
The above query returns mi timeseries joined with m2 but "> xxxx" is applied to value of m1 instead
of reducing the set of m2 timeseries
This could be a syntax
m1 > on(...) group left (m2 > xxxx) but, obviously  I get a parse error
