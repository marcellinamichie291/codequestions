# How do people give name to the colors? How is the tonal value of a color calculated?

I have seen companies naming the color like red-10, red-20, red-99, etc. After refering to the color material design guidelines, I found that the value after the color name are the tonal value of the respective value.
The following image and text from material.io shows that the color name are made from the main color and then the tonal value of the color. Despite looking for results on how the tonal value is calculated, I could still not find how the tonal value of the color is calculated.
I don't know if this question has already been asked, I could not find it, but if there is please refer me to the question.
Thank you for looking at the question.
I was trying to make a design for my site and I saw that naming colors in the way that other companies do would make my job easier. So, I started to name the colors but didn't find any ways on how to calculate the tonal value of the color.
