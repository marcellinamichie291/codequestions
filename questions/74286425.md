# Is there a way to resolve this MongoDB error on M1 Mac?

When I run mongosh from the terminal, the following error message is showing up:
Current Mongosh Log ID: 63622a3e44b4f06269433548
Connecting to:          mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.6.0
MongoNetworkError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017

What can be done to resolve it?
I tried reinstalling MongoDB multiple times through homebrew. Nothing seems to be working.
