# How to override existing object with dynamic values using spread/Object.assign

I have an object in my state. Then I'm adding values dynamically and it can look something like this:
{
  2311: 2
}

How can I override that 2311 value if it already exists without mutating the state.
Adding a new value is simple. I have an object obj = { prop: val} and then { ...this.state.obj, obj }
but I can't remember how can I change the obj value that is dynamic.
I know that I can do deep copy using lodash or something, change that specific value and I' done but I want to know how to do that the way I described above.
Thanks for any help.
