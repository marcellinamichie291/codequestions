# Localstack not creating cognito user pool

IÂ´m trying to create a Cognito using localstack locally but when I run:
awslocal cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name test

as mentioned on the docs I get the following error:

2022-11-01T19:21:56.136 ERROR --- [   asgi_gw_0] l.aws.handlers.logging     : exception during call chain:
2022-11-01T19:21:56.136  INFO --- [   asgi_gw_0] l.aws.handlers.service     : API action 'CreateUserPool' for service 'cognito-idp' not yet implemented or pro feature - check https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/feature-coverage for further information

Anyone face this issue?
