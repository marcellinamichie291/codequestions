The problem I am having at the moment is that I cant add a certain character to a list at a certain position if a condition is met.
def guess(word,secondword):
    lst1=[]
    lst2=[]
    evaluation=["x","x","x","x","x"]
    for letter in word:
        lst1.append(letter)
    for letter in secondword:
        lst2.append(letter)
    c_let= [i for i in lst1 if i in lst2]
    x=0
    while x!=len(c_let):
        evaluation.insert(c_let[x],lst2.index(c_let[x]))
        x+=1
    print (evaluation)
    
 
guess("fubar","freak")

I have a definition that takes two words and breaks them into character lists. It then create another list of common letters. I now want to insert those common letters into the evaluation list with respect to their positions in lst2. The definition only uses 5-letter words. Can someone help in regards to this?
