# Is it possible to write to an existing csv file in MySQL?

I have an event that exports the stock of products from the database every week. 1 Column is the product_id and the other one is the stock of products at the begging of the week. Is it possible to write a query that creates a new column in this file with the stock at the end of the week ?
Thanks in advance!
Couldn't find a way to do it.
