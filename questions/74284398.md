How do I let TS compiler know a method is in an object?
I have a function, purpose of that is check a function is in an object, my expecting is if hasFunction returns true, that means function exist in object that I'm checking, and typescript compiler stop giving me error:
function hasFunction(obj: any, func: string) {
    if (func in obj && (typeof obj[func] === "function"))
        return true;
    return false;
}

I tried to use it, but received an error:
function callMyFunc(obj: object) {
    if (hasFunction(obj, "myFunc")) {
        obj.myFunc();
    }
}
// error: Property 'myFunc' does not exist on type 'object'.

I tried something like that, but 'in' is not a valid syntax:
function hasFunction(obj: any, func: string): func in obj

so what can I do to let compiler know that function exist on object?
