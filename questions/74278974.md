# How to send a "password reset" email from Swift with Supabase?

I try to rest passwords for users in my swift application. I'm using Supabase as backend. How I can trigger the send?
In Java or Flutter it's like:
supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(
  'sample@email.com')

But in swift I cannot select this option... Can someone help me?
supabase.auth.update(password: newPw)

I can update the password but can't send the email
