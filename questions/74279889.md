# 'Cannot find module' Gitlab CICD pipeline on a gatsby build job

I'm trying to setup a CI/CD pipeline to upload my gatsby project to a server. My web page is multi language and I have a custom script that generate a JSON file for each language pulling the keys from my database. The problem is that Gitlab CICD terminates the job because it can't find the script generatetranslateFiles.js
The file generator script is inside a folder called translator and my npm script point to it like this and generates a folder called locales that contains each language file.
"scripts": {
    "translator": "node ./translator/generatetranslateFiles.js"
  }


I originally had the file path like this, but same problem.
"scripts": {
    "translator": "node translator/generatetranslateFiles.js"
  }

I also was able tu run the job locally and successfully run the script, but when deploying to the gitlab pipeline the same error appeared.
gitlab-runner exec shell install-job

This is my CICD yaml file
image: node:16.17.0-alpine

    - node_modules/
    - locales/

  - build

    - npm run translator
  artifacts:

build-job:
