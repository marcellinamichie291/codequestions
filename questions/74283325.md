# Formatting Phone Numbers in PHP

I am working on an SMS app and need to be able to convert the sender's phone number from +11234567890 to 123-456-7890 so it can be compared to records in a MySQL database. 
The numbers are stored in the latter format for use elsewhere on the site and I would rather not change that format as it would require modifying a lot of code.
How would I go about this with PHP?
Thanks!
