# error when output plugin add kafka in fluent-bit


I am trying to collect log files(.csv / .txt) from any folders and send them to kafka server.
To collect log files and print to stdout is working great.
but, when I changed the config file to send the log file to kafka server,
this error message was shown "kafka plugin doesn't exist."
Is there anyone who can help me?

I tried to copy CMakeLists.txt to default fluent-bit folder and do cmake below.
but this error pops up as well.
