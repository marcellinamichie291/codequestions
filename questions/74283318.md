# How do I create a built-in demo regarding App Store Connect Guideline?

I have a problem when pushing my iOS App to the App Store. I know this is not a coding issue.
I got rejected because of guideline 2.1 that the App Store wants to test full features of my app. There are parts of features that they are unable to reproduce (e.g. OTP code, product code ,etc).
What does it mean by providing built-in demo regarding the 2.1 guidelines? How can I make it?

Added to 2.1: “If you are unable to provide a demo account due to
legal or security obligations, you may include a built-in demo mode in
lieu of a demo account with prior approval by Apple. Ensure the demo
mode exhibits your app’s full features and functionality.”
