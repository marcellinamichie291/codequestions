# How can I write a formula that will automatically take value from another subsheet in Google Sheet?

For ex, we have 10 list of item with price which occupy 10 rows. and then in the total section we write something like this
=SUM(A1:A11)

So, it will give a total value of all 10 item's price. Now let's say after this formula, if I make any change, let's say I changed 5th row price to some diff amount, in that case google sheet is IMMEDIATELY amd automatically making change to our total value.
The similar behviour I want is. From same Google sheet with different SUB-SHEET, if I make any change, then that value I want it to reflect in my current subsheet in a particular position. Kind off automatically copy/paste to my current sheet, when I make change in my diff subsheet.
Is that possible?
Example sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/168a1b2GAo-X4iw4-b18N9z7ROloToiUtWQUXnzp79zU/edit?usp=sharing
So from "Sheet A" I want to paste value to "Sheet B" everytime I make change in "Sheet A"
