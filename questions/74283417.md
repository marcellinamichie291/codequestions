# Jetpack Compose delete TextField content with icon

I'm trying to make a custom TextField where the text gets deleted when the right icon is pressed. The problem with the following code is that the textFieldValue.text is a val, so it can't be reassigned.
So far the only solution I have found is to recompose the entire TextField sending "" as the text. Is there a better way to achieve this?
var textFieldValue by rememberSaveable(stateSaver = TextFieldValue.Saver)
    { mutableStateOf(TextFieldValue("")) }

    MyTextField(
        text = textFieldValue,
        onValueChange = {
            textFieldValue = it
        },
        leftIconClickable = { /*Do nothing*/ },
        rightIconClickable = { textFieldValue.text  = "" }
    )

(At this point this textField has almost the same code as the TextField of Jetpack Compose, the main difference being that it also receives 2 clickables for the icons)
