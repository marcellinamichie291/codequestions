# How to set private file directory of Drupal by Bitnami on AWS ECS Fargate?

Drupal 9 requires that the private file directory be set by editing the Drupal settings.php file. However, when I deploy the Drupal by Bitnami container (https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/drupal/) on AWS ECS Fargate, I am unable to SSH in to the machine and update the settings.php file.
I'm aware that one solution may be to configure ECS Exec (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/new-using-amazon-ecs-exec-access-your-containers-fargate-ec2/) so that I can tunnel into the container and edit the settings.php file. I'm wondering if that's the ideal solution, or if there is some way to use Docker/ECS commands to potentially:

Copy a custom settings.php file from an outside source (local, or S3)
or
Append text to the settings.php file this container creates after site installation
or
Something I'm not considering

The ultimate goal would be to set a private file directory which I can mount to an EFS system to. So, if there's an EFS related shortcut I'm missing here, that could also prove useful.
I tried looking through the Drupal by Bitnami documentation to see if there was an environment variable or parameter I could set for the private file directory, but I did not see anything.
Thanks in advance,
Jordan
