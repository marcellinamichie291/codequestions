# Execute prodecure and return data from more than one table in .net core

I have a c#.net core project, I connected to the sql database with the scaffold command and all the tables in sql were mapped to classes in a certain folder
I want to access a procedure that has a join. How do I save all the data in C#? Do I need to create a new class for each procedure?
I searched a lot on Google and did not find an answer
