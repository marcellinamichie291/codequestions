# How to get Mac M1 CPU clock speed from a terminal command?

I need to be able get the CPU clock speed from M1 / M2 Mac computers through a terminal command. Has anyone been able to figure out if this is possible?  I used to be able to do this with Intel MacBooks but on the M1 I havent' been able to find a command to return this information.
This worked on Intel Macs:
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
Any ideas?

This is the M1 Mac
