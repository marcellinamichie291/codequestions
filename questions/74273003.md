# How to get data from set of array between two json?

I have two json file, One is Courses and another one is instructor. Courses and instructor are matched with _id. Now what I want is when an instructor details is send, all courses of that particular instructor is also send in the response. How may I suppose to do that?
Instructor JSON data
let instructorData = [
  {
    _id: 1,
    name: "superman",
    courses: [1,3],
  },{
    _id: 2,
    name: "batman",
    courses: [2],
  }
];

module.exports = {
    instructorData: instructorData,
  };
  

Courses JSON data
let coursesData = [
  {
    _id: 1,
    name: "DC",
    instructor: {
                _id:1
                 },
  },{
    _id: 2,
    name: "Marvel",
    instructor: {
                _id:2
                 },
  },{
    _id: 3,
    name: "DC vs Marvel",
    instructor: {
                _id:1
                 },
  },
];

module.exports = {
    coursesData: coursesData,
  };
  

for Instructor 1 here I have 2 courses. How may I find/iterate the 2 courses?
For example when I am getting an instructor I want it like:
{ name: "superman",
 courses: [{name: "DC"},{name: "DC vs Marvel"}] 
}
