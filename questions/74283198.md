# How to add several AxesSubplot instances into a subplot

I've called an instance method four times, and each time an instance of the Matplotlib class AxesSubPlot is returned.
I'm slowly getting to grips with Matplotlib, but I'm unsure how I render the four separate instances of AxesSubPlot as a MatplotLib subplot of 2x2.
Please note: these four separate instances of AxesSubplot that I have were not generated by myself calling a Matplotlib method directly. I hope that makes sense.
Thanks.
