# Reading Packets from Outgauge in C++

I want to create custom dash software in c++ based on outgauge, mainly to play Beamng.Drive, but I have no idea how to read the packets sent from an ip address and port from outgauge and outsim. Also, is it an option to do it through USB, I want to be able to use it without internet.
I tried reading documentation on LFS but it is all in phyton, also i tried reading the files that are in beamng.drive and i got to know a little about what things about the car are being sent from outgauge and outsim, but i still have no idea on how to get that data to c++.
