I have a set of data, like this




Column A
Column B




Cell 1
Cell 2


Cell 1
Cell 4




and expected result should be like this,
{
ColumnA: Cell1,
ColumnB: { Cell2, Cell4 }
}
Any has a any good approach with java streams?
I grouped original list like,
Array.stream().map(ColumnA::getData).distinct().get() == 0;
Array.stream().map(ColumnB::getData).distinct().get() == 0;

instead is there anyway that i can make this generic as a common operation or any straight forward way?
