# pylint with Django settings not working in vscode

I am attempting to configure pylint to use in my Django project. However, in VS Code it does not seem to be working when I configure my settings.json.
For example, my settings.json is as follows:
{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
      "--disable=C0111",
      "--load-plugins",
      "pylint_django",
      "--django-settings-module",
      "myproject.settings"
    ]
}

When I remove the two lines "--django-settings-module" and "myrpject.settings", pylint begins to work and throws linting errors. When I add the lines back, the linting errors go away (when they should actually be linting errors i.e. importing a package that isn't used).
Below is my folder structure for the project I am working in.

What could be the issue behind the django-settings-module? Why is it not registering when the argument is used?
