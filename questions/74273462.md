# Mismatching React types in pnpm monorepo

i'm trying to convert an inherited monorepo from yarn+lerna to pnpm workspaces
i'm currently getting an error due to mismatching react versions, typescript isn't picking up on the @types/react version that's closest in the tree for some reason
i have a packages/web package that uses react 18 types, and a packages/native package that uses react 16 types.
i have loads of errors in the native package like
'Text' cannot be used as a JSX component.
  Its instance type 'Text' is not a valid JSX element.
    The types returned by 'render()' are incompatible between these types.
      Type 'import("~/node_modules/.pnpm/@types+react@16.14.34/node_modules/@types/react/index").ReactNode' is not assignable to type 'import("~/node_modules/.pnpm/@types+react@18.0.14/node_modules/@types/react/index").ReactNode'.

any idea how to fix this?
