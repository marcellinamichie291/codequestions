# Select the only the first nearest previous value in a mysql database


I have this MySQL table where I want to fetch the first/nearest previous "excess" with the same item_id, using prodDetailsid = 4 as my starting point, I want to get ONLY the "excess" from prodDetails_id = 3 since it was the closest in this case since it was just a sample data.
I have tried using the Lag() function and below is my query, my $itemID value is 4 in this case.
$sql = "SELECT lag(excess, 1) OVER (ORDER BY prodDetails_id) AS newExcess FROM proddetails WHERE item_id = ?";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $itemID);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result(); // get the mysqli result

    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        $excess = $row['itemID'];

        echo $excess; // output to be sent as response to AJAX
    }
}

The response (echo $excess) I get is passed on to my jQuery AJAX Success function, the "excessOut" variable is what I am using to display it to my page.
success: function (res) {
      console.log(res);
      let excessOut = $("#excess-out"); // element

      excessOut.text(res); 
    },


Unfortunately, the value I get is 6.782.94, which is the combination of the 2 excess from prodDetailsid = 1 and 3. I just want to get 2.94 from prodDetailsid = 3 since it was the nearest excess value with the same itemid from prodDetails_4.
What should I do with my query to just display the first nearest previous excess value?
