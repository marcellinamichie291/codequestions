# Neither Github nor its other products opening on the laptop

I've been trying to login into my GitHub account in my new laptop for the past few days and have been facing a lot of problems. Whenever, I try to go to github.com, it displays the following message...[![This site canâ€™t be reached. The webpage at https://github.com/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.
ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID]

I'm able to login into GitHub through my phone but not through the laptop.
I tried to download git, but again I got the following message....
Also, in my VS Code, on starting it, it shows [Unable to initialize Git; Aggregate Error(2) Error: Unable to find git Error: Unable to find git]
I searched on youtube and tried flushdns, used cloudfare, different browsers(eg.:MICROSOFT EGDE, OPERA, FIREFOX etc.) and delete site settings. I thought there was some problem with Chrome, so i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but still no hope. None of them were able to solve my problem. Is there a problem with the site or the laptop?
