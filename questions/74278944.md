# Separating the variable and add to cart button

I am using the plugin Variation Swatches for WooCommerce and want to seperate these swatches from the Add to Cart button.
I'm working on a new design for my product page but I want to put these 2 into different columns.
Does anyone know how to achieve this?
All help is welcome
I've already tried making 2 buttons where on 1 I hide the button and on the other one I hide the variations.
