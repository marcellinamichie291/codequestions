after i wrote the code the output was strange :// and wasn't correctly executed i an addition that i variable in the main class wasn't changing here is the output of my code

your CGBA is : NaN and your grade is null
I wonder if anyone can resolve or edit my code to be able to work properly
note [i am a new in java programming and i am not so good at arrays :) ]
this is the code
package cgba;

import java.util.Scanner ;
import sun.security.util.Length;

public class CGBA {

    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        
        cal_cgba obj = new cal_cgba () ;
        
        for (int i = 0 ; i < 6 ; i++ ) {
            
            System.out.println("Enter your score in subject "+obj.nsub[i]);
            obj.p[i] = input.nextDouble();
            
        }
        
        for (int i = 0 ; i < 6 ; i++ ) {
            
            System.out.println("Enter the credit hour for subject "+obj.nsub[i]);
            obj.cr[i] = input.nextInt() ;
            
        }
        obj.tpcr = ( obj.tp )*( obj.tcr ) ;
        obj.eCGPA = ( obj.tpcr ) / ( obj.tcr)  ;
        String st = "null" ;
        
        if (obj.eCGPA>=3.5) {
            
             st = "Excellent";
            
        }
        
        else if (obj.eCGPA<3.5 && obj.eCGPA>=3) {
            
            st = "Very Good";
            
        }
        
        else if (obj.eCGPA<3 && obj.eCGPA>=2.5) {
            
            st = "Good";

            st = "Fair";
            
        }
        
        else if (obj.eCGPA<2 && obj.eCGPA>=1) {
            
            st = "Very Weak";
            
        }
        
        else if (obj.eCGPA<1) {
            
            st = "Very Weak";
            
        }
        
        System.out.println("your CGBA is : "+obj.eCGPA +" and your grade is "+st);
