# How does return statement with assignment work for calculating Fibonacci number

To understand the below Fibonacci calculator, I wonder how the following return statement with assignment works:
let a = 0;
function foo (b) { 
  if (b === 20) return 1; 
  else return a = foo(b+1) + foo(b+1);
}

Which gives the following results:
foo(15)
>> 32
a
>> 32
foo(18)
>> 4
a
>> 4
foo(19)
>> 2
a
>> 2
foo(10)
>> 1024
a
>> 1024

What is the exact behaviour of the assignment, and why do the values of a become multiples of 2?
This can possibly also explain why this works for calculating Fibonacci:
const fib = (n, dp) => {
  dp = dp || {};
  if (dp[n]) return dp[n];
  if (n === 1) return 1;
  if (n === 0) return 0;
  return dp[n] = fib(n - 1, dp) + fib(n - 2, dp);
};
