# Why does this Python/cv2 Video Frame-Retrieving Code not work Properly?

So I made a code, that processes a video to Generate ASCII art out of it. My code to Generate code from a image works fine, but using it on a Video doesnt work, because I messed up the Code to get Specific Frames from the code.
It only renders the first few seconds of the video, and this VERY slowly.
NOTE: I used import statements like from cv2 import resize as cv2Resize. that should explain the function namesðŸ˜…
    vidCap = cv2VideoCapture(video)
    
    fps = vidCap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)

    seconds = int(input("video seconds: "))  # normal second retrievment didnt work
    
    arr = [] # the array full of ASCII test (the frames)
    dic = {} # the dictionary (also full of frames, will get converted to json and saved)
    
    def gotoFrame(fr):  # pretty selfexplainatory
        vidCap = cv2VideoCapture(video)
        vidCap.set(1, fr)
        
        
    jsonfile = open(videoname + "_ascii.json", "w") 
        
    frames = 0
    
    for i in range(int(seconds) * 2):
        
        _, frame = vidCap.read()
        
        gotoFrame(frames)

        frame = cv2Resize(frame, (frame.shape[1] * 5, frame.shape[0] * 2))
        frame = cv2Resize(frame, None, fx = 0.1, fy = 0.1)
        
        while (frame.shape[1] > 50) or (frame.shape[0] > 20): # just to make it smaller, so that 1 px = 1 ASCII char
            frame = cv2Resize(frame, None, fx = 0.8, fy = 0.8)
            
        #   
        #   ASCII ART GENERATION CODE
        #
        
        arr.append(strng) # strng = the outputted string
        dic["frames"] = arr
        
        frames = frames + int(fps / 2) 
        
        print(str(i) + "/" + str(len(ran)))  # just so that the user sees how long it takes
    
    dic["fps"] = fps
    jsonfile.write(jsonDumps(dic).replace('"', '\"'))
    
    keyPress("f11")  # fullscreen terminal
    
    for a in arr: # print it
        print(a)
        sleepSeconds((fps * 2) / 1000)
        os.system("cls") # clear console window

I already tried changing alot of my code, like changing the gotoFrame() function, and some more stuff, but nothing worked.
If you have any Solutions, thanks!
