# An error happened while reading data from the provider: A call to SSPI failed, see inner exception

Grr - I hate upgrades that break things
I have upgrade MySql Connector/Net to 8.0.31 from I think it was 8.0.28. And also the ODBC (both 32 and 64 bit) to same.
I think this has broken my Excel Power Query connectors which connect a spreadsheet to a database as I'm getting the title error message. Having similar issues with Power BI connectors as well.
I can't trace the inner exception as there is no ability with Excel / Power Query to do this unless I missing something. Other answers talk about this being security stuff but I have no way of changing/altering this.
Even more frustrating is that this message appears on some of my databases but not all.
The underlying MySql database is very old at 5.6.10 (and I have no way of upgrading this)
I'd downgrade back to 8.0.28 (at least it worked) but I'm not sure how feasible of otherwise that is. I get the impression
I can happily query via a SQL tool (e.g. dbeaver or MySQL Workbench) so this is something else.
Any ideas on what I can do to fix this?
Thanks
EDIT:
So I downgrade MySQL Connector t0 8.0.28 (by using Windows Programs and uninstall the various MySQL 'upgraded' component so that downgrade to versions I wanted)
Still had the error. It is very much a security issue and disabling encrypted connection has fixed most of it.
Like to know why this happened as not happy exposing more than I want too.
Phew.
