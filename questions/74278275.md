# Power BI Service not allowing Parameters to be edited. Gateway connection and Scheduled Refresh also grayed out

New to PowerBI.  I am publishing my reports to a folder the client created.  When they go in as shown in the screenshot they are seeing these 3 options grayed out.  How do I fix this?  I tried changing the Parameter Types to TEXT from DATE so I don't think that is the issue.  Are there some settings that need changed on the Service Side or other where I can enable these options for them?  I should mention that they are not grayed out in the folder that I made them for me, just for other users trying to access this report.
