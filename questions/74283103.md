# Sort a stacked bar chart with transform fold Altair

I was wondering if there is any way to sort the bars within a stacked bar chart when the chart contains a transform fold. My data is "wide form":

and I want each row of the dataframe to be represented with its own bar in a chart. Hence, I need to first do a transform fold. This all works fine and the bars appear to be sorted alphabetically by default. HOWEVER, let's say I want the order of the bars within the stacked bar to be different from the way they are displaying by default.
I have tried:

changing the order of the columns within the transform_fold
adding a sort parameter within the X axis definition (both None so that it ignores the alphabetical default sort and the explicit ordered list as shown in the code below)
adding an order field
adding a sort parameter within the color definition

None of these approaches seem to make any difference from the default alphabetical sort! Is there a special way to do this when you have a transform fold?
Minimal code (with all attempts at ordering added) and output here:
small_df = pd.DataFrame({'Probability A':[0.2,0.8,0.4],'Probability B':[0.5,0.1,0.1],'Probability C':[0.3,0.1,0.5],'ID':['John','Sally','Frank']})

alt.Chart(small_df).mark_bar().transform_fold(
        ['Probability A','Probability C','Probability B']
    ).encode(
        x=alt.X('value:Q',scale=alt.Scale(domain=[0, 1]),sort=['Probability A','Probability C','Probability B']),
        y='ID:N',
        order=['Probability A','Probability C','Probability B'],
        color=alt.Color('key:N',sort=['Probability A','Probability C','Probability B'],scale=alt.Scale(domain=['Probability A','Probability B','Probability C'],range=['red', 'orange', 'green']))
)
