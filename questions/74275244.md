# How to color given data with matplotlib python?

I took Machine Learning course but since I have no idea about ML, it is very hard for me to understand all concept. I have a homework and I have to plot data to be able to start homework but I couldn't even plot the data properly. For question, instructor sent us a csv data file which consists of 3 columns. 3rd column shows data class either blue or red. But I didn't understand how to use it. Question is in below:

I tried to plot data but I got this result:

My code is like this:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


df = pd.read_csv('Question1.csv')
X = list(df.iloc[:,0])
y = list(df.iloc[:,1])
X = np.array(X)
y = np.array(y)

plt.plot(X,y,'.' )
plt.plot()


You can see and download data set from here.
Could someone help me to classify data, please?
I couldn't try anyhing cause I didn't understand anything about question.
