# Same App Appears Twice in Apple Health Sources since migrating to SwiftUI App Lifecycle

I recently updated an Apple Watch App from the app + extension lifecycle to the SwiftUI lifecycle.
Or to put it another way, the bundle Ids have changed so that:
New
com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger
com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger.watchkitapp
Old
com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger
com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger.watchkitapp
com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger.watchkitapp.extension
For me everything works great, but we have multiple reports of people seeing two versions of the app in the Apple Health Sources

Customers say that workouts recorded on phone go into one app and on the phone into the other. There are two sets of permissions because of this and some users are reporting that the permissions are not set as they would expect.
On both devices
HKSource.default().bundleIdentifier is com.paddlelogger.paddlelogger
Is this something I've done wrong? I can't find any docs on migrating from from the legacy Extension style to the new SwiftUI Lifecycle
