# dl libs and pthreads required in GitHub Actions

I'm developing a dynamic C++17 library that uses SQLite. It's a CMake project and the requirement for it to be dynamic comes because I plan to mainly use the library through JNI.
So, in my project I build SQLite as a static library:
add_library(sqlite3 STATIC "${sqlite3_SOURCE_DIR}/sqlite3.c") # STATIC to efficiently link to SHARED main library
set_target_properties(sqlite3 PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) # Required to link STATIC to SHARED
target_include_directories(sqlite3 PUBLIC "${sqlite3_SOURCE_DIR}")

And my main library as shared:
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED <library sources>)
target_compile_features(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC cxx_std_17)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}) # To include headers without using relative paths
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE sqlite3)

Then if I link my library to some executable like this it builds and runs absolutely fine on my PC:
add_executable(app <app's sources>)
target_compile_features(app PUBLIC cxx_std_17)
target_include_directories(app PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} <main library src dir>) # Including the main library like this is a temporary solution, because there is no separate include dir yet
target_link_libraries(app PUBLIC ${PROJECT_NAME})

But when I try to build it in GitHub Actions I get these errors:
[100%] Linking CXX executable app
/usr/bin/ld: ../src/mylib.so: undefined reference to `pthread_mutexattr_destroy'
/usr/bin/ld: ../src/mylib.so: undefined reference to `pthread_create'

/usr/bin/ld: ../src/mylib.so: undefined reference to `pthread_mutexattr_init'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

I can fix it by linking the library target to ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS} and Threads::Threads, but I'm not sure if I'm doing what should be done and not just silencing some other mistakes of mine.
To be clear, I don't use any of the functions mentioned in the errors above in the code of my library.
The questions are:

Why does the original code work on my PC and doesn't on GitHub Actions?
Is what I did the right way to fix this?

I'm building the project locally on Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL) with a compiler identified as GNU 11.3.0, while GitHub Actions runs Ubuntu 20.04 using GNU 9.4.0 compiler.
