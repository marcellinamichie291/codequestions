# How to get database server name in springboot

I want to execute a stored procedure based on the server name in am spring boot application
Below is the stored proc.
  @Query(nativeQuery = true, value = "EXEC sys.sp_wait_for_database_copy_sync  @target_server = N'sql-secondary', @target_database = N'sql-primary'")
  @Transactional
  public void spWaitForDatabaseCopy();

I want to execute this query only if current server is primary. How can I achieve this springboot java ?
I tried below code to get the server name:
  @Query(value = "SELECT  @@SERVERNAME AS 'Server Name' ")
    public String getServerName();

but I see error at @.  or DISTINCT expected, got '@'
Is there better way to get the server name and then execute stored proc based on the result?
