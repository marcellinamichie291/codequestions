# Transferring data to another sheet depending on a match value in a cell - with NO VBA

Im not sure if I can explain this very well.... I have a transport form embedded in a SharePoint web page, this form transfers data to a SharePoint excel document. The form captures the item numbers, dates and time, collecting staff member, and if there are delay reasons, plus other mandatory data I dont need, this information is recorded sequentially.
I would like to make a dashboard that shows:

The item number
when the staff member left,
when they arrived
who it was,
what department this was for
if there was a delay,
how long they took.

Then If a staff member goes to recollect an item this needs to show on a new line.
I need multiple areas to be able to view this dash board and filter down to their department, but they will not need to edit the sheet.
The added issue is I cannot use VBA as SharePoint on the web will not run macros so this all needs to be formulas


Sheet 1 - will paste into excel
Mandatory form Number   Start time of the form being filled in  Form submitted time ** this is the time I want to capture as it repesents the time the form was submitted by the staff member on departure and arrival    Mandatory form field    Mandatory form field
ID  Start time  Completion time Email   Name    Item Barcode    Department  Sent For / Arrived  Assigned SSO    Delay Reason - If Applicable

I'm not sure where to start, I've tried a vlook up, then a index match, which has taken me a long time and I not convinced this will achieve what I need, would someone be able to point me in the direction of where to start, I could muddle through this with VBA, but it wont work with the intended end location (SharePoint), and my brain is stuck on what the best way forward would be. Also big apologies for how poorly this question is asked, I dont know how else to convey this problem
Thank you for any help
Kind regards
Kate
