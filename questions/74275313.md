# "FAILED:unable to verify the first certificate" for client cert authentication with optional_no_ca

We have configured our Nginx webserver to perform client cert authentication with the ssl_verify_client set to optional_no_ca.
With this optional_no_ca configuration, Nginx shouldn't drop the request if the client cert is issued by a different CA and, Nginx should provide the result of this authentication in ssl_client_verify variable, which we can use to drop or allow the request.
But, we don't observe this behaviour. Nginx drops the request with the below error.
FAILED:unable to verify the first certificate
To give additional context, we have two root CA certificates, some clients are signed with FirstRoot CA and some are signed with SecondRoot CA. (I understand that this is a wrong design)
In Nginx's ssl_client_certificate directive, we have provided the FirstRoot CA file path, and we observe that the client certificates issued by the SecondRoot CA's are getting dropped.
Is my understanding towards the optional_no_ca usage correct? Please provide any ideas to drill this down. Thanks for your time.
