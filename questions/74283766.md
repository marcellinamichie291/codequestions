# Why can't the app reviewer log into iOS app but everyone else can?

I am having a very frustrating problem where the iOS app reviewer is unable to log into my app during their review. I have never had this problem with any device or simulator (iPad/iPhone/various versions) and none of my Testflight users have had this problem either. My authentication and signin code is not that complicated and I am having a hard time figuring out how it's not working.
This is the code that is run when the sign in button is tapped:
        AuthManager.shared.signIn(email: email, password: password) { [weak self] result in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                switch result {
                case .success:
                    HapticsManager.shared.vibrate(for: .success)
                    let vc = TabBarViewController()
                    vc.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
                    self?.present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
                case .failure(let error):
                    HapticsManager.shared.vibrate(for: .error)
                    print(error)
                }
            }
        }


And this is the AuthManager signIn function:
    public func signIn(email: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<User, Error>) -> Void) {

        self.auth.signIn(withEmail: email, password: password) { result, error in
            guard result != nil, error == nil, let uid = result?.user.uid else {
                completion(.failure(AuthError.signInFailed))
                return
            }
            DatabaseManager.shared.findUser(uid: uid) { user in
                guard let user = user else {
                    completion(.failure(AuthError.signInFailed))
                    return
                }
                UserDefaults.standard.setValue(user.username, forKey: "username")
                UserDefaults.standard.setValue(user.uid, forKey: "uid")
                completion(.success(user))
                
            }
        }
    }

They are running the app on an iPad supposedly but I can not replicate the problem. I have cancelled and resubmitted as well as just updating the binary. Any ideas?
