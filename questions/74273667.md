# useEffect Fetch showing 0 array in react

I am creating a React app that uses Fetch to pull a API using SQLite, however for some reason it shows in console length: 3, and Array[0] only.  I cannot pull from data just id 1 for example.
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default () => {
    const [brands, setBrands] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch("/api/brands")
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => console.log(data))
            .then((data) => {
                setBrands(data);
            });
    }, []);
    return (
        <>
            {brands ? (
                <>
                    <h1>Brands</h1>
                    <ul>
                        {brands.map((brand) => (
                            <li key={brand.id}>{brand.name}</li>
                        ))}
                    </ul>
                </>
            ) : (
                <div>Loading...</div>
            )}
        </>
    );
};


How would I be able to pull from this id 1 for example? at the moment only all the brands show when I remove the console log and show as I pasted in the screen shot above in console.
