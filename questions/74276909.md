# How do I convert a string response size to MB in Python?

I am doing a bit of a scraping project where I am scraping some data file information. The issue is that the response is a string that is sometimes in kB, MB, GB etc. What I need is to convert the response I get to MB and drop the text part eg. 290.5kB should return 0.29 without MB at the end.
The scraped section looks like this:
Format: MapInfo MIF, (290.5 kB)
Here is my code snippet:
f_file_size = file_format.split('Format: ')[1].split(',')[1].strip(' ()')


output_dict['data_files'].append({'file_size': f_file_size})

Which outputs:
"data_files" : [{
    "file_size": "290.5 kB"
}]

Your assistance will be highly appreciated
