var tableDigit = 0
var tableTill = 0
var i: Int = 1
func table (tableDigit:Int, tableTill:Int) -> String {
    while (i <= tableTill) {
        print("(tableDigit) * (i) =", tableDigit * i)
        if i >= tableTill {
            break
        }
        i = i + 1
    }
    return ""
}

I want to print the return of this function in a UITextField or UITextView but in either case I am getting an error. How can I fix it
