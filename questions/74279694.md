# In Python dealing with data stacked in columns by splitting and merging

I need to use Python to automate the processing of files that have data stacked in columns like this:




User Name
Why would you...?




name1
Because


name2
Because


User Name
Which do you...?


name3
C


name2
D


User Name
How much...?


name4
23


name1
425




My first thought is to split the dataframe into one for each question and then merge them on User Name. How can I extract the chunk of rows for each question though? Perhaps there are other ways as well?
I have not found a way to do this yet.
