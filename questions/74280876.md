# Using a IIFE as an alternative to let

so I was wondering if it was a bad practice to use an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) as an alternative to long ternaries and let. An example would be
IIFE:
const result = (() => {
    if (situation_one) {
        if (situation_two) return 10;
        return 20;
    }
    return 30;
})()`

Ternary:
const result = situation_one ? (situation_two ? 10 : 20) : 30;

Let:
let result;

if (situation_one) {
    if (situation_two) result = 10;
    else result = 20;
} else result = 30;

Is there something I am missing?
