# CORS isnt allowing access from dynamic origins

In my NodeJS/Express API i am trying to setup CORS so 3 specific domains can reach the API. I've followed a couple SO articles that show how the npm module cors is setup, even the npm docs for cors itself. however for some reason it will only ever allow access from one domain, all other domains receive a CORS issue,
so i've tried
var allowlist = ['http://example1.com', 'http://example2.com']
var corsOptionsDelegate = function (req, callback) {
  var corsOptions;
  if (allowlist.indexOf(req.header('Origin')) !== -1) {
    corsOptions = { origin: true } // reflect (enable) the requested origin in the CORS response
  } else {
    corsOptions = { origin: false } // disable CORS for this request
  }
  callback(null, corsOptions) // callback expects two parameters: error and options
}

which comes from the npm module, with the correct domains for the site, however, using this in the browser, i would see the first allowed domain, as the expected origin. so if i was making a request from x.com domain, but y.net was the first allowable domain, the CORS error in the console would state as such it expects requests from y.net
i've also tried...
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://x.com');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://y.com');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://z.com');
  res.header(
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
    'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept'
  );
  next();
});

which is something that is referenced from a different SO article, however this had the reverse effect, instead of allowing access from these origins, it only allowed access from z.com origin, The only way i've been able to allow access from all three origins is to allow access from ALL origins, which is not something i want to do.
