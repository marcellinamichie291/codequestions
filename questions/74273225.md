# How a mean and st. deviation can be calculated from an imported MS Excel table?

I imported an MS Excel table in R 4.2.1, using  the clipboard
library(clipr)

my_data <- read_clip_tbl()
my_data

   Year    Contract Compensation
1  2014    Oerlikon        95741
2  2014    Oerlikon       105771
3  2015    Oerlikon        90799
4  2015    Oerlikon        90282
5  2015    Oerlikon        89485
6  2016    Oerlikon       108976
7  2016    Oerlikon        84187
8  2016    Oerlikon       117542

Unfortunately, I was unable to use https://rdrr.io/snippets/ to interface with a file or clipboard.
When I try to calculate the mean or standard deviation on the compensation field, I get a message that the argument is not numeric

mean (my_data,compensation)
[1] NA
Warning message:
In mean.default(my_data, compensation) :
argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

Is there a way to import an MS Excel table to  https://rdrr.io/snippets/ ?
How can I get the right format (vectorize?) of the table?
The expected average is 100.185,82 and the St Dev is 19.951,74
