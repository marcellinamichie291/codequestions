# Best Way to approach a 3D customisable Globe in Flutter?

following question:
I'm currently working on a Travel App and I thought of the idea of implementing an 3D Globe that can be rotated by the user. I thought of the Globe as a basic White Sphere with the borders of the countries visible as a stroke. All countries that have been visited should be filled with a color.
I thought of implementing it with the unity widget, but I'd like to maintain a lightweight feeling.
Is there a way to emulate js or WebGL?
What do you think is the best way to approach this?
Thank you for your time
Linus
