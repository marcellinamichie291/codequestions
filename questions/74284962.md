my need is to use native query and interface-based projection in JPA to fetch the record from multiple tables
 @Query(value = "select cm.center_code as centerCode,cm.center_name as centerName,es.exam_slot_code as slotName,ecm.total_seat_allocated as seatAllocatedCount,ecityM.city_name as centerCity,afcatg.name as groupName from center_master cm  "
