# is there a pattern for getting scoped singleton services from the injector?

I have a component which has many internal services as dependencies.. This component is being used in multiple places throughout my app, so there are different instances of these internal services holding specific state for the given component.  Currently, I am just doing something like:
ngOnInit () {
  this.serviceA = new ServiceA();
  this.serviceB = new ServiceB();
  this.dependencyStore(this.config.name, { 
    serviceA: this.serviceA, 
    serviceB: this.serviceB 
  });
}

The idea is that the DependencyStore object that would hold multiple instances of these dependencies scoped by a given component's configuration name..  That way other components/services that need to make use of those dependencies can just fetch them and utilize them as necessary.
I am curious, are there any better ways to accomplish this sort of thing?  Would there be a way to have the injector create new instances of the services, and set an injector token based off of the component's config name property?  That way I would not need the concept of this DependencyStore object?
If so, I am imagining the other objects that currently make use of the DependencyStore would instead just be able to use the injector like:
// some component
constructor (private serviceA: ServiceAUsedByComponentInstanceA, private serviceB: ServiceBUsedByComponentInstanceA) {}

// some other component
constructor (private serviceA: ServiceAUsedByComponentInstanceB, private serviceB: ServiceBUsedByComponentInstanceB) {}

I am just a little unclear on how I would set something like this up, so that A) the injector would be able to new up multiple instances of the dependencies (SeviceA and ServiceB) and B) make those instances available with specific injector tokens so that other components/services can access them a specific token to ensure it is getting the instances that were created by specific instances of the component they were created by (hopefully that makes sense)...  Is this sort of thing possible?
