# How to stream Ogg File?

I have a Ogg File (opus encoded) with headers, oggpages, etc.
This ogg is perfectly working in file (can listen, seek...). But when I try to send it to mediaserver, I have one issue :
the stream always starts from the very beginning at position 0. If someone joins the stream 1 minute later, he will start the stream from 0 and he would have 1 minute latency.
Audio : Ogg/Opus ; MediaServer : NodeMediaServer ; Transcoder : ffmpeg
How to change the start position of stream of ogg file ? Is this in opus headers ? A custom parameter of ffmpeg ?
