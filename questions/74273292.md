# Deploying MERN Application (using GraphQL) to Heroku

I just completed a MERN application following a great guide but it doesn't cover deployment. I am currently unsuccessful deploying, getting 'Application Error' at this link: https://enigmatic-castle-43725.herokuapp.com/
Here is the link to the git repo: https://github.com/Sciphr/Project-Manager
I have set up a 'heroku-postbuild' script with the following commands:
"NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
  },

My project setup is using Create-React-App in a 'client' folder, and then building the express server in a 'server' folder. I have the environmental variables setup in Heroku, and at one point the page loaded (just not the data from the GraphQL queries), but now it is back to 'Application Error'
I have a strong feeling the issue is with my index.js file in the 'server' folder, but I can't seem to understand exactly where the issue is. Thanks for any/all help anyone can give me, it really is appreciated. Cheers!
