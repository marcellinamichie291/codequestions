I am tgrying to modify an item in list  orderUtilities if it is located in list selectedOrderUtilities. However it always come out unmodified - check with debbuger and then in swagger. Could you please point out to me what am i doing wrong.
private async Task<IEnumerable<OrderComplimentaryUtility>> TEst(IEnumerable<OrderComplimentaryUtility> orderUtilities, IEnumerable<OrderComplimentaryUtility> selectedOrderUtilities)
    {
        foreach (var utility in orderUtilities.Where(a => selectedOrderUtilities.Any(b => b.CommodityId == a.CommodityId)))
         {
                utility.IsSelected = true;
                utility.Price = 1000000;
                utility.Name = "TEST";
          }
         return orderUtilities;
    }
