# Is it possible to define a record as the union of 2 records

declare
     type a is record(a1 number, a2 varchar2(10));
     type b is record(b1 number, b2 varchar2(10));
     type c is record(a1 number, b2 varchar2(10),c1 number, c2 varchar2(10));
begin
    null;
end;

the record c is defined like that: the fields of c are the field of a + b.
I have a real example with a lot of field. Is there a more efficient way to declare c.
Something like that ?
 type c is record( a..., c...);

And more importantly I would like thatif I change the definition of a or b, the definition of c change too.
