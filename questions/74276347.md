# Define environment variable in a subshell with heredoc

Background: testing a bash script inside a pod where default user does not have sudo rights so that user cannot user vim or nano to create a .sh file so I have to find a way around with cat << EOF >> test.sh.
I am doing some local test to make sure it's working properly first. Locally I am creating a file test.sh with nano. See below
#!/bin/bash
# test.sh
VAR="Test"
echo $VAR

When I cat it:
#!/bin/bash
# test.sh
VAR="Test"
echo $VAR%  

I save test.sh , made it execuatble chmod +x test.sh and ran it with ./test.sh The output:
Test

Now when I try to mimic the same behavior in a bash heredoc instead this is the command I use:
cat <<EOF >> test.sh
#!/bin/bash
# test.sh
VAR="Test"
echo $VAR
EOF

I saved it and made it execuatble as well. The cat output is:
#!/bin/bash
# test.sh
VAR="Test"
echo 

So obviously running it wouldn't work. The output null.
I think the issue I am facing is that the environment variable $VAR is not defined properly inside the subshell using heredoc.
