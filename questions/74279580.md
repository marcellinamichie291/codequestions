# Three.js pin object to right side of another

I have a cube and a sphere, both created into three.js. Now the cube moves around and rotates, while the sphere is stationary. I want the sphere to always be on the right side of the cube, regardless of it's position or rotation. So if the cube rotates, the sphere should move because the position of the right side changes. I can do it by creating a group:
let objects = new THREE.Group();
objects.add(cube);
objects.add(sphere);
scene.add(objects);

This works fine, but is it possible to do this without a group? Thanks!
