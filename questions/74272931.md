# why the below code is taking two input on single execution of scanf funcion

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

int main()
{
    int Dividend,divisor;

    printf("Checking Divisiblity of 1st number with 2nd number \n\n") ;

    printf("Enter Number \n") ;
    scanf("%d",&Dividend);

    printf("Enter Divisor = ");
    scanf("%d",&divisor) ;


    if(Dividend % divisor == 0)
    {
        printf("Number %d is divisible by %d",Dividend,divisor) ;
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Number %d is not divisible by %d",Dividend,divisor) ;
    }

    getch();
    return 0;
}

Above is my code that i have written in C ;
on running this program  . Only on first  execution  of scanf   function if i give two input  space seperated , the second input is going on right variable . and on hitting enter i am getting result . I am not understanding how is this happing .
