# MS SQL create table combining static table with texts and table with records added from PLC

I have two tables. One, tableX, that gets values from a PLC and one, tableY, that hold text strings. I need to populate a third table with rows of only the records that have a specific value, 1, in tableX and combined with their respective text labels from tableY
tableX has columns mapped to all relevant tags in the PLC plus a timestamp column getdate() ie when a tag in the PLC shift to 1 it will create a record in tableX with a timestamp and a 1 in the corresponding cell.
tableX




timestamp
INFO00_1
INFO00_2
INFO00_3
INFO00_4




getdate()
Cell 1
Cell 2
Cell 3
Cell 4




tableY has two columns no and name. Here records consist of the text string and no. The no column is also a text. like this.
tableY




no
name




INFO00_1
some text string


INFO00_0
some text string




I am faily new to SQL so I bear with me. I think that i can use a stored procedure to create a temp table that gets updated whenever there is a new record in tableX and then use this table to populate  a tableZ adding the no eg INFO00_1 to the record. like this
tableZ




no
timestamp
name




INFO00_1
getdate()
some text string




Hopefully this makes sense and is doable, otherwise I am in trouble
