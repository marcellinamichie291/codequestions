# Loop Through a String and Replace Full Stops with a New Line in Kotlin

I have some cooking instructions obtained as an API response but it is in prose (sample below). I need to format and put a new line for every full stop(.) in the sentense.

"Put the flour, eggs, milk, 1 tbsp oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.\r\nSet a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper. When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.\r\nServe with lemon wedges and sugar, or your favourite filling.

I am working with the below code but it is not putting the new line/ line break after the full stop.
val input = meal.directions
val formattedDirections = input.replace("\\.\\s?", "\\.\n")

I have looked around similar questions posted for Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP and C++ but I can't find a way out.
Anyone with the Algorithm/Regex or a lead please help
