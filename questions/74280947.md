# How to loop over @AppStorage values and use them for creating TextFields?

I am trying to loop over @AppStorage variables and use them to create TextFields with predefined values. I've tried several things as adding and removing $ for variable1-5 and variable, but nothing seems to work.
To make it easier I reduced the amount of variables and removed all the unneeded code.
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    static let store = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.not-important.etc")
    
    @AppStorage("variable1", store: store) var variable1 = "a"
    @AppStorage("variable2", store: store) var variable2 = "b"
    @AppStorage("variable3", store: store) var variable3 = "c"
    @AppStorage("variable4", store: store) var variable4 = "d"
    @AppStorage("variable5", store: store) var variable5 = "e"
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            Form { 
                Section(header: Text("Variables")) {                    
                    HStack (alignment: .center) {
                        ForEach([
                            $variable1, // also tried variable1, etc...
                            $variable2,
                            $variable3,
                            $variable4,
                            $variable5
                        ], id: \.self) { variable in // also tried $variable
                            TextField(
                                "",
                                text: variable // also tried $variable, variable.wrappedName, variable.text, etc...
                            )
                        }
                    }
                }             
            }
        }
    }
}

Please help to understand what is the issue here and why I can not get it to work.
More info on errors here:

Provided example throws an error for ForEach line:
Generic struct 'ForEach' requires that 'Binding<String>' conform to 'Hashable'

When trying $variable in instead of variable in I get:
Inferred projection type 'String' is not a property wrapper

TextField("", text: $variable) throws:
Cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected argument type 'Binding<String>'
