Below  is the sample function which I tried. How do I achieve this loop through current active selection in google sheet and its values in an array.

function awe(){
  var selected1 = sheetname.getActiveRange()
var values = selected1.getValue()
}

I am getting only value i.e in first cell in google sheet instead of the range which I selected. I want the values of all current active selected range in an array.

I want only the user selected range values only to array in google app script to process.
