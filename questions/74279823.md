# I keep getting a TypeError when using gbt_regression_prediction().compute with XGBoost and daal4py

I have a pre-trained XGBoost model that I want to optimize with daal4py but I'm getting the following error
TypeError: Argument 'model' has incorrect type (expected daal4py._daal4py.gbt_regression_model, got XGBRegressor)

Here is the line with that is throwing the error:
y_pred = d4p.gbt_regression_prediction().compute(x_test, xgb_model).prediction.reshape(-1)
