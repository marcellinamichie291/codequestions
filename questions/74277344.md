# django foreignkey and create index

Im currently working on a DRF api, and need to remove ForeignKey from model in models Note and Comment. I was told i need to replace the FK with an index in that column instead. Ive looked into the relationship and can't think of a way to maintain the many to one. Im working with a Postgresql db and Note as the parent model and comment as the child. My question- Is there an altenative way of making this happen(removeing the FK on both models and still maintaining the ManyToOne? and how would i replace the FK column with an index?) thank you for any possible help.
Models.py
    class Note(models.Model):
    creator = models.CharField(auth.models.User, on_delete = models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField(max_length= 200)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.content

    class Comment(models.Model):
    content = models.TextField(max_length= 200)
    creator = models.ForeignKey(
    auth.models.User, related_name="comments", on_delete=models.CASCADE
    note = models.ForeignKey("Note", related_name="comments", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    

serializer.py
    class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        creator = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source="creator.username")
    class Meta:
    model = Comment
    fields = ["uuid", "content", "creator", "notes"]
    class NoteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        creator = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source="creator.username")
        comments = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True)
        class Meta:
           model = Note
           fields = ["type", "content", "creator", "comments"]
