I need to add license to solutions in my App (Sales app) or it can be any model-driven app. The scenario is that I have to restrict the functionality added in the solution, after a specified time.
I'm using CRM Online.
Kindly suggest me any solutions.
Thanks
I've gone through the Internet but not found any suitable link or documentation.
