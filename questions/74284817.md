# How do I create a dependent dropdown list by referencing column values?

I am new to coding and need guidance/assistance on how to complete this code.
I created a parent dropdown list titled "ingredients" in google sheets via the data validation tab. I am attempting to create a dependent drop down list titled "variants " that appears with two criteria:

ONLY when the selected value from the parent drop down list is appears more than once on a reference sheet.
IF the the value that contains duplicates is selected, I want the dependent drop down list to display all variants, found in a different column on the reference sheet, to appear in the dependent drop down list.

I tried to obtain a range that consisted only of the values in the drop down list. However they are  displayed in a column and I cannot index this column in order to log its numerical value and reference it to the parent name.
Here is my code and snapshots of my data
