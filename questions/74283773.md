# I need to select all the the recipes (in this case) that have these specific ingredients

Im trying to select all the recipes that have chocolate and water only, currently the ingredients table has all the ingredients that the recipes have, but when i try to select , it only will select in a specific order, for example if i instead of putting chocolate first and water second, decide to put water first and chocolate second it will not select anything. Im using pgadmin4.
select nombre, ingredientes from recetas where Lower(ingredientes) like Lower('%chocolate% %agua%');
(here it shows one recipe)
select nombre, ingredientes from recetas where Lower(ingredientes) like Lower('%agua% %chocolate%');
(while here it shows none)
