From many textbooks about computability, I see how we define equivalent turing machines as follows:
Two turing machines TM1 and TM2 are equivalent <=> L(TM1) = (TM2)
where L(TM1) is the languages accpeted by TM1, i.e. L(TM1) = {w | TM1(w) = accept}, and so is L(TM2).
My question is: why does the above definition totally ignore the 'rejected languages' {w | TM1(w) = reject} and 'loop languages'{w | TM1(w) goes into infinite loop}?
Intuitively, TM1 and TM2 are equivalent if and only if their input-output relation are exactly the same, which means they output the same thing, or react in the same manner for any possible input. Say, if L(TM1) = L(TM2), then it is still possible that these exists some w0 such that TM1(w0)=reject while TM2(w0) goes into infinite loop, and thus we conclude that TM1 and TM2 are indeed not equivalent. However, according to the definition on textbooks, they are equivalent, which is not intuitive.
I try to obtain some explanation of the counterintuitive definition of equivalent Turing machines on textbooks.
