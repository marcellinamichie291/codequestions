# How to have detail view selected by default for NavigationStack in IOS16

Using the new NavigationStack in iOS16 what is the best way to have a detail view displayed by default instead of the stack?
This is what I have so far:


struct SomeView: View {
var animals = [Animal](repeating: Animal(), count: 1)

var body: some View {
    
    NavigationStack() {
        List(animals) { animal in
            NavigationLink(animal.name, value: animal)
        }.navigationDestination(for: Animal.self) { animal in
            AnimalDetailView(animal: animal)
        }
        
    }.onAppear{
        
    }
    
}

}

It seems like there should be something simple I could add in the onAppear modifier (or somewhere else) that allows me to have something pre-selected, but I can't find anything that doesn't use the deprecated tag or selection method
