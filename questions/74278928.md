# when mapping a dict to column fillna doesn't work

I have a dict which I try to use to convert values in a column. If the key is not in the dict I want to keep the original value. I used:
df['column'] = df['column'].map(dict).fillna(df['column'])

Returns only converted keys which are in the dict, so .fillna instruction doesn't work
