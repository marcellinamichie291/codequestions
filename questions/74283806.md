a. Estimate the arithmetic average and geometric average growth rate in earnings per share
between 1989 and 1994. Why are they different? Which is more reliable?

I am not interested in the actual calculation for arithmetic and geometric average growth rate. However, I do not know why they are different i.e the intuition behind it and which one is more reliable?
