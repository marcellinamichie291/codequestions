# How to execute useQuery (hook) onClick of a button?

So Iam trying to fetch data from my API using axios and useQuery. Since Iam using pagination I have to update fetched data everytime user want to display another page of data.
Like this:
export const getAll = () => {
    axios
      .get(`http://localhost:8081/api/users?pageNumber=${page}&pageSize=5`)
      .then((response) => {
        response.data.content as User[];
      });
  };

Then Im calling this method in another file like:
const [page, setPage] = useState(0);
 const [data, setData] = useState<User[] | null>();

 //If button is clicked, the page will change
 const ChangePage = (event: any, page: number) => {
    setPage(page - 1);
  };

//When the page changes, useEffect has to fetch new data with the new page as parameter
  useEffect(() => {
    const result = getAll(); //Execute fetching of data using axios and useQuery
    setData(result); //set new data
  }, [page]);

  const users = data?.map((user) => <UserItem key={user.id} user={user} />);

The fetching works fine but when I want to display another page with new data I have to use useEffect and everytime useState with pageNumber changes, new data will be visible.
The problem is that I cant use my getAll() fucntion in useEffect since this function uses useQuery (hook). My question is, how can I execute getAll function every time pageNumber changes (or simply, how to re-fetch data evrytime button is pressed?)?
The code works fine when Im not using useQuery hook.
