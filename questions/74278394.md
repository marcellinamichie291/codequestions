# I have an error with a busy port; how to find what application is taking up an open serial port on a Mac?

I am working with arduino and processing for the first time on a Mac. I am using a downloaded file to run the application. Arduino is completely exited out of so I do not think the problem is because both systems are open. I also do not think there is a problem with the file because I tried running it on my friends computer and it worked jsust like it should. The error it said is "Error opening serial port /dev/tty.wlan-debug: Port busy. I cannot figure out how to identify what port is open.
I have restarted my computer about 10 times and redownloaded the program about 5. I have opened the Terminal using lsof and I cannot find anything about the port I need opened above. I have very little computer experience so I do not know how to continue.
