# How to create fields in a class using Symbol

I have class Movie. Movie constructor should provide a generation of unique product id within the application no matter how many products are created. You also need to define a field with the name of the movie. But according to the condition, for this I have to use Symbol data type. How can i do this?


class Movie {
  constructor(name) {
    //here I need to generate a unique id; 
    //here I need to define name fields
  }
}
