# Is \\*.zip skipping other files with zip in the name?

I have a release pipeline that consumes the build artifact and deploys it on the app service.
The artifact has the following file jszip.min.js yet when the deployment occurs, it appears the file gets deleted in the app service, so i have to reupload it manually after the deployment which is frustrating.


File gone after new deployment:

Ive tried including it explicitly in the skipObject arguments:
....0.png|jszip.min.js|\\*.zip

but that didnt include it in the enxt deployment from the artifact and thus the file was still missing following the new deployment.
A reason considered is because in the additional arguments of the Azure App Service Deploy task, I have skip:objectName=filePath,absolutePath="...\\*.zip. However, i doubt that is the reason because the filename in question is jszip not js.zip, so there should be no reason it would possibly match that to .zip.
So what is the issue and how do i make sure the jszip.min.js makes it to the app service upon deployment like other files?
