# How can i import dataset from kaggle directly into my Jupyter notebook?

I've worked with a couple of datasets on Kaggle but every time I download the data and then import it to my notebook. I'm trying to upload it directly via URL but in vain.
I've searched for a few ways, but not getting how they work.
