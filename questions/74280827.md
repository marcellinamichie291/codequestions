# Android charging or plugged to a power source states

I have an dashcam which automatically starts and stops recording based on charging (start on charging and stop when it stops charging)
So I have something like this at the BroadcastReceiver.onReceive
Intent.ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED -> {
    startRecording()
}
Intent.ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED -> {
    stopRecording()
}

Some users reported that recording stops when their device becomes fully charged though it is still plugged to a power source via USB.
So it seems BatteryManager sends the event that the power is not connected.
What can I do in this case to know for sure that it is still plugged to a source power?
Mb should I use the following solution?
Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED -> {
    val plugged = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_PLUGGED, 0) != 0
    // conditionally it looks like this: if (plugged) startRec() else stopRec()
}
