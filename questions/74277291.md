# Switching between pages does not work on a react app that is deployed on Netlify

I created a react project and ran npm run build  in terminal so I could deploy it on Netlify.
If I run npx serve -s build in terminal and open the link, page works as expected.
When I deploy build on Netlify everything works fine until I try switching pages. I get an error where it says Page not found.
I haven't tried anything else after deploying the page on Netlify since I have no clue what could be the problem.
