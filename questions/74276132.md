# Exchanging data between two python applications

I have two programs ProgramA and ProgramB (both written in python).
ProgramA polls a database constantly and whenever there is an event, it updates a stack like database.
ProgramB is constantly looking for a new event in the stack like database, whenever there is a new event ProgramB picks it up processes it and waits for the next event.
Note: There is no concurrency or multiprocessing present in the programs themselves (ProgramA and ProgramB). Also the application does not have access to the Internet.
I was originally thinking of using SQLite as the stack like database. However, I am wondering, is there a better solution like a messaging queue of some sort?
Any suggestions?
