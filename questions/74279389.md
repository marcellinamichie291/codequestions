# Recode factor based on values from a string

I have a (very) large dataset, which has been imported from a server without any formatting. The formatting has been given to me in a text file. Let's say I have a variable in the dataframe, is there any way I can format it as a factor with the levels as defined in the string.
Take for example, a dataframe df which has a variable value that can take either 1, 2 or 3, which should be coded as defined in the string format:
format <- "
    1 = 'Declined'
    2 = 'Registered'
    3 = 'Randomised'
"

df %>%
  mutate(value = as.factor(value) %>%
           fct_recode(format))
