# Scrolling two big lists synchronously

I am trying to build a screen, where we have a horizontal calendar on top which scrolls horizontally and a vertical calendar on the bottom using https://github.com/marcocesarato/react-native-big-list
An example picked up from Supershift

When we scroll bottom vertical calendar, top horizontal calendar should also scroll in sync and vice versa.
Both the calendars are using big-list. Is there a way on how to achieve such a thing?
Any hints are appreciated.
