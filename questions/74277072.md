# How to customize hover colour for each row in ag grid react

I am using react grid and I would like to set the hover color and rowSelectedColor for each row differently, When I tried overwriting the hover background color it applies to every row not each row.

I tried using rowClassRule for achieving the functionality but it did not worked, I am expecting row should have there own unique hover color and selected background color based on some condition ex: age>10 then hover-color: Red
