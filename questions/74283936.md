# Can I declare an "alias" function which checks an object's type in TypeScript?

I'm working on converting a codebase to TypeScript and it has a lot of shorthand functions like isFunction, isArray, and isString. Is there a way for me to declare to the TypeScript interpreter what these shorthand functions do (e.g. declare that isFunction(x) is exactly the same as typeof x === 'function'), so we can continue to use these shorthands?
function isFunction (x) {
    return typeof x === 'function';
}
function isArray (x) {
    return x instanceof Array;
}
function isString (x) {
    return (typeof x === 'string');
}

As currently written, TS only knows that isFunction(x) returns a boolean, so it has no way of knowing that isFunction(x) is exactly the same as typeof x === 'function', so it throws a compile-time error when I attempt to do this.
function doCallback(callback?: () => {}) {
    if (typeof callback === 'function')
        callback(); // Allowed by TS interpreter
}
function doCallback(callback?: () => {}) {
    if (isFunction(callback))
        callback(); // Error: Cannot invoke an object which is possibly 'undefined'.
}
