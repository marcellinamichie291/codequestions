# measuring changes in what3words coordinates as the user clicks on squares using python

I'm trying to make a python code to be able to open what 3 words in the web browser and as the user clicks on different squares, the code will be able to read off the coordinates of the selected squares.
I've tried making a code that reads URL changes as the URL of the webpage will alter depending on the square that's been selected but nothings worked. I've been working on this for months and any help with this would be greatly appreciated!
