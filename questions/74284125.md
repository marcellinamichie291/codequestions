# How to display graphics with ARM assembly language?

I would like to practice assembler for the arm architecture and I would be interested in working with the graphical subsystem and visualizing some algorithms. I can't define the scope of work, on one hand I don't need to write my own graphics engine, on the other hand I don't know where to start. Basically I just need to arrange the pixels on the canvas, but I have no idea how the programming of graphics applications works.
Can anyone suggest sources or give me a quick primer? Are there special registers for working with graphics?
