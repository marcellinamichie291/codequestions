I'm using gdb 10.2 in a gnome-terminal (on Ubuntu 20.04 running in WSL2), where gnome-terminal is configured to follow the system theme.
In tui mode, if the current line is indicated by a black bar. Function calls are formatted with black foreground text, rendering them unreadable:

Already tried

set style source off: The current line is now readable, but source color coding is now (obviously) disabled
set style function foreground white: No effect
Configure gnome terminal to not follow the system theme: The terminal switches to "dark mode": The background now becomes black, the bar turns white. The function names are readable, but the legibility of many of the differently colored things is reduced.
Possible duplicate question

At this point, disabling source highlighting is workable, but suboptimal. Tips are most welcome!
