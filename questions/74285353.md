# Moving div to the right inside flexbox while keeping space-around width

So I am trying to move a div to the right inside flexbox.
I dont want to change justify-content to anything else, but I am trying to move the middle div to the right. However if I use margin and move it then the space around the whole parent div is also affected. Is it possible to move the middle div to the right without affecting the space of the whole div?
So far this solution kind of works- but the items will overlay on each other on smaller screen so this is not responsive at all:
.item2 {
   margin-left: 100px;
   margin-right: -100px;
   border: 1px solid red;
}

But it doesnt seem very elegant. Is there a way to do it with flexbox only?


.main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
}

.item1 {
   border: 1px solid red;
}

.item2 {
   margin-left: 100px;
   margin-right: -100px;
   border: 1px solid red;
}
<div class="main">
 <div class="item1">
  Item 1
 </div>
  <div class="item2">
  Item 2
 </div>
  <div class="item1">
  Item 3
 </div>
</div>
