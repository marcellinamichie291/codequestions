# Left 'Option' button on German Mac keyboard not working, Parallels-Kali

I am having a Macbook M1 and have there several Linux distros installed (Ubuntu,Fedora) and now also Kali. I changed in Kali the keyboard/language settings in the same way I did on Ubuntu and Fedora, and the keyboard works fine (also German letters ä ö ü ß work) except that the (left) Option key does not work in Kali, and also not their combinations like Option + Shift.
On a 'german' Mac you type Option + Shift + 7  for backslash. Or Option + 5 for '['. It does not work in Kali.
However, the right Option key + '?' produces backslash. And (right) Option + 6 makes ']'  .
I am not sure if this is the US default or some other language.
I also changed in the terminal the language with
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
(changed to German)
also changed via terminal:
nano /etc/default/keyboard
XKBLAYOUT="us" to "de"
Nothing helps.
