# React Router Link changing css

For some reason the React Router Link is significantly changing my css. Is there a way I can remove any styling impact from the Link?
Without Link:

With Link:

This is the code for the Link. It has no style features.
```
<Link to={`/link/${item.id}`}>
```

style={{textDecoration: 'none'}}
