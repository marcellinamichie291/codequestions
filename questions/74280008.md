# Can use environment variables with the sub intrinsic function?

I am using the sub function to define a resource within an aws IAM service.
Resource:
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:s3:::example-${TEST1}-${AWS::REGION}-test'

${TEST1}: it is an environment variable that I have in my java project.
${AWS::REGION}: pseudo parameter
I want to know if !sub is able to read the environment variable and if it can't, is there any way I can do it even if it's not with this function
