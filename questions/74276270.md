# DTO objects are not passed in the request

Here is my code on nestjs
dto file
export class RequestDTO {
  @IsString()
  name: string;

  book: {
    authorone: string;
    authortwo: string;
  };

  @IsString()
  title: string = 'Test Book!';
}

On post request, I'm passing all params but I'm getting only
{
name: "test",
title: "Test Book!"
}

Why is book object data getting removed from this?
