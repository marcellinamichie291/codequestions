# Stored procedure is not updating records in Oracle

I have written a stored procedure to update records based on ID which is unique column. But the procedure is not updating the records.
Below is my query
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_REJECT_INFO
 (

  P_ID IN NUMBER,
  P_APPROVE_REJECT IN NVARCHAR2,
  P_REJECT_REMARKS IN NVARCHAR2,
  P_REJECTED_GRP IN NVARCHAR2,
  P_REJECTED_BY IN NVARCHAR2
  --TBL_INSERT OUT SYS_REFCURSOR

   )

 AS 
BEGIN

 UPDATE tbl_pre_post_hoto
 set APPROVE_REJECT = P_APPROVE_REJECT,
  REJECT_REMARKS = P_REJECT_REMARKS,
 REJECTED_GRP = P_REJECTED_GRP,
REJECTED_BY = P_REJECTED_BY,
REJECTED_DATE = SYSDATE

WHERE ID = P_ID;

  EXCEPTION

WHEN OTHERS THEN
NULL; 

 END UPDATE_REJECT_INFO;

Please help what is wrong in the procedure
