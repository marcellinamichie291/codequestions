# CortexXDR service detected start snap-core-20-1634.mount

I have a server and I am using CortexXDR to have control of it, but I received a notification that an uncommon service was started, it says that is low risk, but I have to give explanation of this service, but I couldn't find it, its name is snap-core-20-1634.mount and seems to be an ubuntu command, hope someone knows what this is
snap-core-20-1634.mount
