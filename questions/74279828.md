# getting version `GLIBC_2.29' not found when installing and configuring envoy 1.24 binary

I am working on installing and configuring envoy 1.24 binary on CentOS7 machine.
I download the binary: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/download/v1.24.0/envoy-1.24.0-linux-x86_64 from the envoy releases. Since this is a binary file, I created the following service unit file:
[Unit]
Description=Envoy
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/envoy/envoy -c /opt/envoy/envoy.yml -path.home /opt/envoy -path.config /opt/envoy -path.logs /var/log/envoy
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
KillMode=mixed
SyslogIdentifier=envoy
LimitNOFILE=640000
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

I reloaded the system demon so this unit file is reloaded.
I had a very basic envoy.yml in the right folder and executed the command: systemctl start envoy. I am seeing this error:
/lib64/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /opt/envoy/envoy)

What am I missing here?
The envoy documentation does not talk about how to use the binary directly.
Also the deployment instructions: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/install#install-envoy-on-rpm-based-distros is downloading version 1.18 version instead of 1.24.
Any pointers on resolving the above error?
