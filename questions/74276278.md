# Error occurred in background process. spawn /bin/sh ENOENT

When I using visual studio code to create a spring boot java project and try to add a new dependency, Error occurred in background process. spawn /bin/sh ENOENT this error occurs.
I found that it is a permission problem in the internet, but /bin/sh cannot change permission.
This is the information at output:
Spawn {"command":"\"/usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.4/libexec/bin\"","args":["-s","\"/usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.4/libexec/conf\"","-B","-N","-DgraphFormat=text","-DshowDuplicates","-DshowConflicts","-DshowVersions","-DshowGroupIds","-DoutputDirectory=\"/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/6abd59f00810680789df47da1ebf3cd0/vscjava.vscode-maven\"","-DoutputFileName=\"58e04c2e353c1802f3f63b9a0c3dce14.deps.txt\"","com.github.ferstl:depgraph-maven-plugin:4.0.2:graph","-f","\"/Users/user/Desktop/Spring/demo/pom.xml\""]}

I have tried click the refresh button near Dependencies or tried to show the dependency list I have, this error occurs again.
