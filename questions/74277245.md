# How to construct polynomial functions, without symbolic toolbox

Here's my approach:
Given an array of the coeficients C=[cn, cn-1, ...,c0] my function would be the following
g=@(x) x.^(n:-1:0)*transpose(C)

But when trying to evaluate integral(g,min,max), it doesn't allow. It's probably due to how integral function is defined, but is there a way to construct this polynomial, so I can integrate them? I'm aware of the polyint function, but I'll need this function to evaluate the integral of g(x)*f(x), with f(x) being some "generic" function.
