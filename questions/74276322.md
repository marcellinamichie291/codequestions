# Is there a way to solve the no-data when I click on the view for the first time? In Swift

I want to display the content of a Card with a Modal View that appears when I click on the Custom Card, but when I click only one card (not different card) , it displays a Model View with no data in it. After that, it works good for every card.
This is the code where the error is:
import SwiftUI


struct GoalsView: View {
    
    @Binding var rootActive: Bool
    @State private var showSheet = false
    @Binding var addGoalIsClicked: Bool

    @State private var selectedGoal : Goal = Goal(title: "", description: "")
    
    var body: some View {
        
        ScrollView {
            VStack(){
                HStack{
                    Text("Add goals")
                        .fontWeight(.bold)
                        .font(.system(size: 28))
                    Spacer()
                }
                .padding()
                
                ForEach(goalDB) {goal in
                    Button() {
                        selectedGoal = goal
                        showSheet = true
                    }label: {
                        Label(goal.title, systemImage: "")
                            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                            .foregroundColor(.black)
                    }
                    .padding()
                    .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showSheet) {
                        ModalView(rootActive: $rootActive, goal: selectedGoal)
                    }
                    .background {
                        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
                            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                            .foregroundColor(.white)
                }
                }
                .padding(4)
                
            }
        }.background(Color.gray.opacity(0.15))
     
    }
}



I tried to find a solution on the Internet (someone has my same problem), reading the documentation of the FullScreenCover but I can not find out how to do it
