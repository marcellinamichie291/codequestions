I'm trying to access to a MySQL DB using PHP, with the mysqli function.
My code is
$query = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT DISTINCT NAME, SEX, AGE, SUBJECT FROM PEOPLE P, SUBJECTS S WHERE ID = M.ID_PERSON AND NAME LIKE '%?%'");
$query->bind_param("s", $Name);

Then I'm getting the next error:
Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError: The number of variables must match the number of parameters in the prepared statement in /var/www/html/BD-PHP/person.php:25 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/html/BD-PHP/person.php(25): mysqli_stmt->bind_param() #1 {main} thrown in /var/www/html/BD-PHP/person.php on line 25
According to me, the variables must match, since I have only one '?' symbol inside the prepare function, and it's a string. What may be going wrong?
