# Finding two min/max 2d arrays

I am generating a bunch of dynamic data that looks like this:
data = [area, height]

I want to keep a record of the two minimum heights and their min/max areas and the two maximum heights and their min/max areas like this:
thresholds = [[0.2, 0.251],[0.4, 0.22],[0.2, 0.85],[0.4, 0.823]]

If I then want to add:
new_data = [0.45, 0.25]

The height should consider anything with a distance < 0.1 to be the same
,so I need the system to remove the list with
[0.4, 0.22] because the new data will replace the max area in the minimum height bracket
I figured I could add the new data to the array and sort, but unless I can get it to accept anything with a distance < 0.1 as the same height, it won't sort it correctly with
thresholds = sorted(thresholds, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])

Is there any way to do this without creating a 20 line if statement?
