# Border Gradient with Border Radius

I have the following CSS:
a.btn.white-grad {
    background: $lgrey;
    color: #313149 !important;
    border: 1px solid #000;
    border-image-source: linear-gradient(to right, #9c20aa, #fb3570);
    border-image-slice: 20;
    float: left;
    @include font-size(26);
    margin: 75px 0;
}

Adding border-radius: 5px doesn't seem to do anything. I figured it's because I'm using a border gradient... is there a way for me to achieve the desired 5px border radius at all?
