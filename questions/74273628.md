# Problem integrating firebase sdk with ruby app. No documentation found

I'm trying to send push notifications using Firebase cloud messaging but I'm having issue adding firebase SDK and initializing app. I've searched almost everything about this but there's no documentation for integrating Firebase SDK with Ruby.
Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
