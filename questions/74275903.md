# XAMPP mysql not starting on Mac, OS Monterey version 12.6

i have now spent hours on google to find a fix. No success.
I am running xamp version 8.1.6.0 on my Max (OS see above) and it wonâ€™t start mysql. Apache web server and ProfTPD work without a problem.
Two questions:

where are my data????? I have several tables full of valuable data. Can they be saved?
How to fix the issue? Any advice?

I really appreciate your help
Cheers
Klaus
I tried reboot the pc, change port and put the line
"innodb_force_recovery = 1"
into the Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc/my.cnf file
No success
I also tried to start mysql from the terminal using
sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/mysql.server start
I got the following message:
Starting MariaDB
