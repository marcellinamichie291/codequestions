# Write SQL row related content to file using Powershell

I am trying to write SQL Server stored procedure definitions to files using Powershell, I can execute the query and create the files in the loop, but the file content is all of the content (all data) not the definition for the current item in the loop that is being written
This is my Powershell at the moment:
$query = "select  o.name
,cast(m.definition as varchar(max)) as content
 from
sys.objects as o
inner join
    sys.sql_modules as m
        on o.object_id = m.object_id
where
o.type = 'p'
and o.schema_id = 7
"

$data = Invoke-Sqlcmd  -ConnectionString "Data Source=server;Initial Catalog=db; Integrated Security=True;"  -Query $query
$folderloc="\\output\folder"
foreach ($row in $data.name)
{
$fullname = $folderloc+$row+".sql"
$content = $data.content
new-item $fullname -ItemType file
add-content $fullname -Value $content
 }
