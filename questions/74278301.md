# macOS Ventura (13) - Add custom ringtones

I want to add custom ringtones for the new macOS. So I downloaded some ringtones in .m4r format. Now I discovered that the standard ringtones are saved in:
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Ringtones/

But I cannot copy files in the Library folder. Even not with root priviledges in the Terminal.
