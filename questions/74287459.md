# Website SEO From Non-WWW to WWW URL Using AWS S3 + CloudFront

I have a website on AWS S3 + CloudFront + Route 53.
The CloudFront dist Alternate domain names uses both www.example.com and example.com. also both records are managed with route53 posting to the Cloudfront dist.
I need to server both records, but SEO wise I need redirect the non-www to the www address.
When enabling redirect host in the bucket itself - I get too many redirect errors.
when removing the www. record - its not served on the net.
How can I bypass this using a single S3 bucket for both domains?
Thank you
