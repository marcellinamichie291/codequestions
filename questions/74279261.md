# Issue with requesting Steam api Bukson

Good day !
To work with the Steam marketplace, I use the Steampy library from Bukson.
It did not have the function I needed to create the itemordershistogram request, so I created it myself in the market.py file.
The problem is that the server responds with a 400 error, saying that the request was incorrectly composed.
I created the function similarly to others, so I canâ€™t understand what the problem is ...
I am attaching the code with my function from market.py:
@login_required
def fetch_orders_histogram(self) -> dict:
    url = SteamUrl.COMMUNITY_URL + '/market/itemordershistogram/'
    params = {'country': 'RU',
              'language': 'russian',
              'currency': 1,
              'item_nameid': 14962984,
              'two_factor': 0}
    response = self._session.get(url, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 429:
        raise TooManyRequests("You can fetch maximum 20 prices in 60s period")
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise ApiException("http error code: %s" % response.status_code)
    return response.json()

And here is the code from Python:
from steampy.client import SteamClient
import time

steam_client = SteamClient('api-key')
steam_client.login("log", "pass", "steam_guard.json")

is_session_alive = steam_client.is_session_alive()

if(is_session_alive):
    print("Successfully logged in")
else:
    print("Error")

time.sleep(3)

resp = steam_client.market.fetch_orders_histogram()
print(resp)

After executing the code, it gives an error:

steampy.exceptions.ApiException: http error code: 400

If you execute the request through the browser, then everything works as it should...

https://steamcommunity.com/market/itemordershistogram?country=RU&language=russian&currency=1&item_nameid=14962984&two_factor=0

Friends, tell me, please, what is wrong in my request?
What to fix?
Thank you very much in advance !
