# Active Row Column Highlight in Office 365 Excel (web version)

I want to highlight active row or column in office 365 excel (Web Version).
I have added script lab add in but I am not a programmer. Can anybody help me with the code or any alternative way for the same.
Tried using VBA code in Script lab but that doesn't work.
