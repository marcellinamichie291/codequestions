# How do I prevent delay in other function(time.sleep)

so I was trying to delay a loop in a function so that the timer could go up every 1 second
from ipywidgets import *
from time import *
timevalue = IntSlider(max =5,value = 0,disabled = True)
x = 0

def timer(self):
    global x
    global l
    if x == 0:
        x = 1
        y = (1,2,3,4,5)
        for i in y:
            sleep(1)
            timevalue.value = timevalue.value + 1

`
so how do I not make the other funcs stop
