# React Native - WebRTC connection in WebView pauses video playback of videos outside of WebView and vice-versa

Within our react native iOS app we have a webview that is responsible for sending/receiving video and audio via WebRTC.
We also have an video component separate from the webview.
If we start streaming via webrtc is pauses the video in the webview, and vice-versa happens - if we play a video in react native, the webrtc video in the webview is paused.
I assume it's something to do with iOS assuming we're on a "call" and pausing video activity anywhere outside of the webview.
Has anyone come across this and know of a solution?
