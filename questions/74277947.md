# How to split a list int groups under certain conditions?

I want to split a list into groups with n elements. For example:
n = 2
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] ->[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5,6]]

n = 3
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [[1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]]

I tried to implement a function, which returns n if n is 0 or greater than the length of the list and the fitted list if n is less than the length of the list.
split :: Int -> [a] -> Either Int [[a]]
split n [a]
   |n <= lenght [a] = Right n (take n [a]) : (split n (drop n [a]))
   |n == 0 = Left n
   |otherwise = Left n

However, I get a "variable not in scope" error. I've already tried around, but I'm stuck.
Did I make a mistake with the data types?
