# How to find Taint info for Nodes through kubectl

I have multiple questions for getting taint information.I know Taint info can be taken from here:  (View existing taints on which Taints exist on current nodes.)
kubectl get nodes -o='custom columns=NodeName:.metadata.name,TaintKey:.spec.taints[].key,TaintValue:.spec.taints[].value,TaintEffect:.spec.taints[*].effect'

Above is as per documentation given in this link, but where is this being referenced from ? Where is this listed?https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/

but how do I find that taint is under Spec. As per kubectl commands, "Taint" value only comes under "kubectl describe node" and not "kubectl get node -o yaml".

I can only find this documentation : (nothing here.)
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#nodespec-v1-core

how do I find out(proof) that spec contains "taints", either some documentation , or some "--help" style documentation , or output for "-o yaml ", or output for "-o json"?


I have tried using kubectl "get" and "describe".I have also tried understanding YAML structure, but it is not listed there, or I might be missing something.
