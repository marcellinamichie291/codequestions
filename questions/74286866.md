# Finding the weighted average of prices in Dataframe

I am trying to create a weighted average of my results to best approximate the final price. Does anyone know how to do this?
ID,SalePrice,RF,GBR,OLS,XGB

9,118000,121912.664944,119945.073066,83918.353787,117998.414
In this table, I have predicted the price using various regression methods, and now I want to combine them all into one weighted average to best model the final SalePrice.
I think I'm looking for an optimization function that gives me the best weights, i.e.:
aRandom Forest + bGBR + cOLS + dXGB = ~SalePrice
Ive tried correlation matrixes and looking at scipy.optimize.minimize but I'm not sure if it's the correct way.
