# Turning QuadExpr into a callable function

For a specific optimization tool, the function that has to be optimized should be callable.
However, all current functions are in the QuadExpr form. Since a QuadExpr is not callable, this raises some issues.
Is there a built in function in python that transforms a QuadExpr into a callable function, or should one build a function to do this by oneself?
The directory for QuadExpr doesn't show immediate converters.
