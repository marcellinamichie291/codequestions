# How can I add social signup, Email verification in my existing django user signup system?

So I am using default django authentication where its taking username and a password for signup. And I have 5 users registered right now.
Now I need 2 features in my user model

Facebook/gmail login
Email verification

The problem is I dont wanna loose my existing users and their records. The tutorials and methods I can find on internet all starts from scratch. Any idea how can I approach this?
in my views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views import generic
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

class UserRegistrationView(generic.CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    template_name = 'registration/registration.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')


urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import UserRegistrationView

urlpatterns = [
    path('register/',UserRegistrationView.as_view(),name='register'),
]
