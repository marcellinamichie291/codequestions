# Error while docker-compose build: fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address

I use ruby on rails.
I tried to run a command;docker-compose -build, but failed because of the error in bundle install.
Failed to install a git repository as a gem.
This is an error message
Fetching https://github.com/xxxxxx

fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address

In my local environment (not docker), bundle install succeeded.
How can I deal with it?
