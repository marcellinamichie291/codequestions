# Flutter Integration Testing - Tear Down and Setup

I'm writing some integration tests for my flutter app that uses Firebase to login.
A problem I ran into is that, after 1 test runs, the second test will always fail because it will remember my login from the previous test, so instead of starting at the login page of the app, it will start at the page after you login (for example).
How can I resolve this? It seems like I need a tearDown() and setUp() but I can't seem to find too much information about it online...
Here's an example of one of the tests I wrote:
void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  testWidgets(
    "Integration test runner 1",
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Wait for the app to launch, etc
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
      app.main();
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      expect(find.text("REDACTED"), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text("REDACTED"), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("usernameField")), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("passwordField")), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("logo")), findsOneWidget);

      await tester.enterText(usernameField, "REDACTED.edu");
      await tester.enterText(passwordField, "REDACTED");
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      await tester.tap(signInButton);
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      //expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("AddChildButton")), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("Child1")), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.byKey(ValueKey("Child2")), findsOneWidget);
      //FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
    },
  );

I tried making my own setup/teardown however wasn't so sucessfull as there isn't much information about it when I looked it up
