# Expire data in Azure Table storage without creating a hot key

I'm trying to model Azure Table storage for a simple website that works like so:

Visitors can create a "widget"
Visitors work with one widget and all its associated data together
Widgets expire after some period of time and should be deleted from the table

I'd like to use a single table for this app, but I'm not sure how to model expiration without either (a) scanning the whole table, or (b) creating a hot key. DynamoDB has TTL that would help, but I haven't seen a similar feature for Azure Table storage.
This is my current design:




PartitionKey
RowKey
Other fields




widget:1
self
{ expires_at: 1000010 }


widget:1
associated:1
...


widget:1
associated:2
...


widget:2
self
{ expires_at: 1000020 }


widget:2
associated:1
...


expires
timestamp:1000010
{ PK: "widget:1" }


expires
timestamp:1000020
{ PK: "widget:2" }




This makes querying a widget by ID easy because I can simply use the filter PartitionKey eq 'widget:1' to get everything for widget 1.
However, the partition key "expires" becomes a hot key. To find expired widgets, I'd do PK eq 'expires' and RowKey lt 'timestamp:(expiry_threshold)'. For simplicity, I was planning to run the "expire old widgets" routine on every request to the website, so every request would hit the partition that contains "expires".
This app's traffic is very low so this won't be a problem in practice, but I'm wondering if there's a "better" design I'm not thinking of, or if this kind of design is common and necessary.
