# Multiple search query

Previously I really liked this package, because it was very helpful and easy to understand
@Entity()
class Person {
    int id;
    String name;
    final address = ToOne<Address>();
}

@Entity()
class Address {
    int id;
    String street;
    String zip;
}

I want to find the name of the Person and the street of the Address, please help...
Thank you very much
Is there something wrong with my code ?
box.query(Person_.name.contains(search_value))..link(Person_.address, Address_.street.contains(search_value));

When I search, the value doesn't appear, even though the character I'm looking for is in either the name of the Person or the street of the Address
