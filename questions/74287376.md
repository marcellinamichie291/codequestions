# static lib recognized as dynamic lib, LNK2038 mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary',

I am trying to link statically. In visual studio, I set Project->properties->C/C++->Code generation->Runtime Library to Multi-threaded (/MT) . However, the linker would error
LNK2038  mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary': value 'MD_DynamicRelease' doesn't match value 'MT_StaticRelease' in ConsoleApplication1.obj 
The latter part MT_StaticRelease does make sense since I am trying static linking, while the former part MD_DynamicRelease is absolutely wrong because I provided static lib. I set Project->properties->Linker->General->Additional Library Dependencies to a folder that only contains *.lib. And I am PRETTY SURE that these *.lib are static library instead of import library.
When I change to Project->properties->C/C++->Code generation->Runtime Library to Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) , the build succeed.
It is really weird that visual studio recognize *.lib as dynamic lib. I've checked %PATH% to rule out any other possible polution. Do you have any ideas?
