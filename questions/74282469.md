# deleting data by quantity of data in pandas

I am trying to delete the data in the dataset according to its quantity. For example

I have a data set with approximately 2000 rows. As seen in the picture above, IsinmaTipi column has 11 different values ​​in 2000 rows. 3 of these values ​​make up approximately 1900 rows. I want to delete the data that is less in number according to their number.
Based on this example, instead of deleting the values ​​one by one as below, I want to delete if there are less than 50 of the data.
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Yerden Isıtma'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Klima'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Soba'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Kat Kaloriferi'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Doğalgaz Sobası'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Isıtma Yok'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'VRV'], axis=0, inplace=True)
df.drop(df.index[df['IsinmaTipi'] == 'Fancoil Ünitesi'], axis=0, inplace=True)
