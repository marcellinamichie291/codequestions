# Filter two tables based on dates and sum the result in power bi

I have a problem summing the result of two tables. The first table has the sold quantities. The second table has the forecasted quantities. Both tables are linked to a calendar table (not represented). The third table has cut-off dates for both products.
Exported:




Product
Date
Quantity




A
1/1/2022
10


A
2/1/2022
10


A
3/1/2022
10


B
1/1/2022
5


B
2/1/2022
5


B
3/1/2022
5




Forecast:




Product
Date
Quantity




A
1/1/2022
20


A
2/1/2022
20


A
3/1/2022
20


A
4/1/2022
20


B
1/1/2022
15

2/1/2022

Cut Off Dates




Product
CutOffDate




A
2/1/2022


B
3/1/2022




The first goal is to filter both tables with the cut off date, getting from the first table and the product A & B:




Product
Date
Quantity




A
1/1/2022
10


A
2/1/2022
10


B
1/1/2022
5


B
2/1/2022
5


B
3/1/2022
5




Those dates are <=2/1/2022 for product A (The cut off date for product A) and <=3/1/2022 for product B (The cut off date for product B).
After that I need the same for table 2, but considering the dates after the cut off date:




Product
Date
Quantity




A
3/1/2022
20


A
4/1/2022
20


B
4/1/2022
15




Next, I need to mix both tables to obtain:




Product
Date
Quantity




A
1/1/2022
10


A
2/1/2022
10


A
3/1/2022
20


A
4/1/2022
20


B
1/1/2022
5


B
2/1/2022
5


B
3/1/2022
5


B
4/1/2022
15




Finally, my goal is to have the following result:




Date
Quantity




1/1/2022
15


2/1/2022
15


3/1/2022
25


4/1/2022
35




Thanks in advance!
I tried to do it using max for the dates, but I can't keep the Product context filter, causing that my table is only filtered by my maximum cut off date (3/1/2022)
