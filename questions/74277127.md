# Excessive "Unmanaged memory" consumed by dotnet 6

After porting from dotnet 5 to dotnet 6 a backend application is consuming a lots of "unmanaged memory". It is a complex F# application hosted on Linux, runs multiple process, lots of serialization of messages from EventStore and have actor model implemented with AKKA.NET.
No major code changes during port.

The unmanaged memory can peak to 6 GB, and if process remains idle (no messages in EventStore) it releases some unmanaged memory and settles around 3-4 GB.
Other Details

OS : Linux (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 10.11)
dotnet 6 Version : 6.0.401
dotnet 5 Version : 5.0.408

Used dotnet-dump and also dotMemeory from JetBrains. (dotMemory does not provide any insights into "unmanaged memory"). Currently exploring WinDbg and dotnet-dump commands.
Help I am looking for is

How to probe unmanaged memory and pinpoint issues?
Any useful commands for WinDbg/dotnet-dump to analyze "unmanaged memory"
Possible reasons on why dotnet 6 needs so much unmanaged memory when dotnet 5 can do with a relatively low footprint.
