# Is it possible to dynamically create a dependency injection token and link it to an instance of a class?

Say I have a component that has internal services as dependencies that are newed up, with a shared configuration object:
@Component({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: SomeService,
      useClass: SomeService,
      deps: [
        SomeOtherService,
      ]
  ...
})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() config: Configuration;

  constructor (private service: SomeService) {}
  ngOnInit () {
    this.service.config = this.config;
  }
  ...
}

...
If I need an external service or component to have access to that specific instance of that component's internal service, how can I do that?
I know I could just use some sort of stateful service that stores references based on the configuration's name like:
  ngOnInit () {
    this.service.config = this.config;
    this.dependencyService.store(this.config.name, { someService: this.service });
  }

then an external service could just do:
  this.service = this.dependencyStore.get('some-name').someService;

But I was wondering, is there any way I could dynamically generate a dependency injection token based off of the name from the configuration object, and store the instance of SomeService in that?  That way I would not have to manually manage storing instances of the service object, and the external service or component that needs that instance of the service could just use a constructor function:
constructor (@Inject(SOME_NAME) private service: SomeService) {}

...  But I am unclear how to define SOME_NAME dynamically based off of the configuration object in the component and provide the specific instance of the service   that the component new'd up using useClass to the injector...  Is there any way to do this?
