# Optaplanner: How to calculate score delta for move

I'm using Optaplanner to automatically solve school timetables. After a timetable has been solved the user will manually change some lessons and will get feedback on how this affects the score via the following call:
scoreManager.updateScore(timetable);

This call takes some 200ms and will, I assume, do a complete evaluation. Im trying to optimize this and want to only pass in a Move object so that Optaplanner only has to recalculate the delta, like:
scoreManager.updateScore(previousTimetable,changeMove);

Is there a way to do this?
