# Interact with Locked Screen

I am trying to create own version of VNC, a very simple solution of it, and so far it's working.
Yet - I can not find a way to interact with the locked screen once the user lock the PC.

How can I interact with locked screen ( take screenshots of it, move the mouse and press keys ) from a service on the recent Windows OS ?
