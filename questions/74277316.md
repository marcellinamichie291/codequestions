# Prove that if ϵ ∈ L1 then L2 ⊆ L2 • L1

Let L1, L2 be languages such that L2 is not the empty language.
Prove that if the empty word epsilon in L1, then L2 is a subset of L2•L1.
Assume towards a contradiction that L2 ⊈ L2•L1.
Thus, the language L1 contains words that are not the empty word, otherwise we could take ϵ and concatenate it to every word in L_2.
So ϵ ∉ L1 which is a contradiction.
Is that a good proof?
Thanks!
