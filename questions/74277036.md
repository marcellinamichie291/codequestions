# How to use windows cmd to move specific file extensions along with the folders that contain them?

Currently trying to figure out a way to move a large collection of video files from D:\Main\*.ext and D:\Main\Sub\*.ext to D:\Videos.  I want to maintain the integrity of the file system in place while being able to separate my video files from the rest of the riff-raff that has gathered in D:\Main folder.  These are obviously not the actual file names, but I tried my best to make my question as simple as it could be.
I have tried the FOR command, the ROBOCOPY command, the COPY command, and the MOVE command.
So far, the FOR command seems the most promising, however, I cannot seem to get the correct syntax to accomplish my objective.
