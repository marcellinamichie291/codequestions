# How to ensure that jobs running on partition A do not affect user priority on Partition B

In our Slurm cluster, we have A, B, C three partitions. All users can run jobs on all partitions, but these have a collective effect on the user's priorities. SO, I want to know if there exist some suggestions that when we running job on A partition will affect user's priority, but for B and C will not.
Ensure that jobs running on partition A do not affect user priority on Partition B.
