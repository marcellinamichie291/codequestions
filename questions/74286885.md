# Can't serialize `PaginatedScanList` - potentially after adding awssdk libraries

We have two versions of a SpringBoot server, both with a generic CrudController, simply relaying GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests to the relevant DyamoDb table in the data layer.
The get handler is super-simple:
@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity<Iterable<U>> get() {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(service.get());
}

Using the implementation of the service/CrudRepository as (e.g.)
public Iterable<U> get() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }

In the older version of the server, that doesn't have additional awssdk libraries (namely s3, sts, cognitoidentity and cognitoidentityprovider) the response gets serialized perfectly fine - as an array of the response objects.
In the new version, however, it gets serialized as an empty object - {}
I'm guessing this is down to losing the ability to serialize PaginatedScanList - as the return value is exactly the same in both server versions.
It's entirely possible that the libraries are a red herring but comparing the two versions, there aren't any other relevant changes on these code paths.
Any idea what could be causing this and how to fix it?
