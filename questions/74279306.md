i am learning DSA and tried this in my own please tell me is this algorithm is insertion sort or not. and guide me...thank you
function insertion(number){
    let length = number.length;
    for(let i = 0; i< length; i++){
        let num = i;
        while(number[num] < number[num-1]){
            let temp = number[num-1];
            number[num-1] = number[num];
            number[num] =temp;
            num--;
        }
    }
    return number;
}
console.log(insertion([3,2,4,6,5,1,2,-1]))

Output = [ -1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
