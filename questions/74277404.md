# Counting number of transactions in the following week SQL

I am trying to get a count of the number of transactions that occur in the 7 days following each transaction in a dataset (including the transaction itself). For example, in the following set of transactions I want the count to be as follows.
┌─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Txn_Date    │        Count │
├─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ 2020-01-01  │            3 │
│ 2020-01-04  │            3 │
│ 2020-01-05  │            2 │
│ 2020-01-10  │            1 │
│ 2020-01-18  │            3 │
│ 2020-01-20  │            2 │
│ 2020-01-24  │            2 │
│ 2020-01-28  │            1 │
└─────────────┴──────────────┘

For each one it needs to be a rolling week, so row 1 counts all the transactions between 2020-01-01 and 2020-01-08, the second all transactions between 2020-01-04 and 2020-01-11 etc.
The code I have is:
select Txn_Date,
count(Txn_Date) over (partition by Txn_Date(column) where Txn_Date(rows) between Txn_Date and date_add('day', 14, Txn_Date) as Count

This code will not work in it's current state, but hopefully gives an idea of what I am trying to achieve. The database I am working in is Hive.
