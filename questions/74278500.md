# Why does my variable suddenly stop counting after the first loop?

I'm writing a program that counts the amount of letters in a word. Everything seems to work fine except for the fact that my variable used for counting the number of letters (numberOfLetters) suddenly stops counting after the first loop. Here is my code:
import random

# Choosing a random word

with open("Random Words.txt", "r") as file:
    allText = file.read()
    allWords = list(map(str, allText.split('\n')))
    chosenWord = random.choice(allWords)

# Resetting variables

correctLetters = []
incorrectLetters = []
hiddenWord = []
numberOfLetters = 0

for i in range(12):  # Loop 12 times
    print(numberOfLetters)
    for letter in chosenWord:  # Loop once for every letter in the word
        numberOfLetters = + 1  # Count the number of letters in the word

Output:
0
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
