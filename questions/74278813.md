# Nvarchar(Max) column to DateTime value

I'm trying to migrate some date from old database to a new database.
In the old database, there is a column that type is nvarchar(max) and the data in that column is like 26/03/2022
But this data I want to insert into the column in the new database and that column is Datetime type.
Can you show me how to convert it to the DateTime format.?
