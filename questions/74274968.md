# AWS MySQL RDS DB instance restarted

Recently MySQL RDS DB instance restarted twice. All I see is it is switched over to a different node. I searched the logs to see if there was any information that would help me understand why it had stopped working. Following the instance restart, the general, audit, and error logs were all emptied out and started over from scratch.
Would someone kindly tell me how to -

Ascertain the cause of its restart? Since it is an automated procedure, I have no knowledge about other nodes.
Configure a cloud-watch alarm or notification before it fails over?

Thanks
