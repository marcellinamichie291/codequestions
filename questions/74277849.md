# What is wrong with this lambda function?

I am at the beggining of Get Programming with Haskell and just learned lambda functions. As an exercise I tried to convert the following example to use a lambda.
calcChange owed given =
  if   change > 0
  then change
  else 0
  where change = given - owed

calcChange 9 7 returns 0 and calcChange 7 9 returns 2
Now, here is my attempt
calcChange owed given =
  (\change ->
      if   change > 0
      then change
      else 0
  ) given - owed

which fails: calcChange 7 9 returns 2 but calcChange 9 7 returns -2.
What is wrong with my attempt?
