# Google Accounts Return Blocked True on Integration

I have an integration with Google to use Login via Google on a platform. In the integration, I use the following call api:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc?action=checkOrigin&origin=https%3A%2F%2F{ORIGIN URL}&client_id={CLIENT ID}, however, this call is not working.
The response I have received is the following:
{
    "valid": true,
    "blocked": true,
    "suppressed": false
}

The problem is "blocked = true", because of that, I can't make the other calls on the Google API to get the user's Token.
I thought it was some source validation setting in Google's own panel, but I've done numerous checks and everything seems to be ok.
Confirmation of key settings on the platform and Google.
