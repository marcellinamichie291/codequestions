# N-queen Chess Final Horizontal Validation using python

I am trying to solve the n-queen validation problem where the user first prints an n by n matrix for our sake, 8 by 8 from 0 - 63. The user keys in the Position of the queens then our model evaluates whether they are attacking each other. I fail to get through the second test case when queen input  =  " 59 24 41 19 52 13 30 47 " where clearly 41 and 47 See Q on the same row. The program should automatically produce a "FAIL" as two queens on the same row attack each other. Below is my code and required output :

# Get the size of the board from the user.
n = int(input("n: "))

# Print the board with numbers.
s =''
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        z = i * n + j
        
        if j != 0:
            s += ' '
        
        if z < 10:
            s += ' '
        s += str(z)
    
    if i != j:
        s += '\n'
print(s)
# Get the queens from the user.
queens = list(map(int, input("Queens: ").split()))

# Print the board with queens.

s =''
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        z = i * n + j
        
        if j != 0:
            s += ' '
        
        if z < 10:
            if z in queens:
                z = " Q"
            else:
                s += ' '
        elif z > 10:
            if z in queens:
                z = " Q"
            else:
                s +=""
        s += str(z)
    
    if i != j:
        s += '\n'
print(s)
# Check if the queens are in the same row or diagonal.
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        try:
            if queens[i] == queens[j]:
                print("FAIL")
                exit()
            if abs(queens[i] - queens[j]) == abs(i-j):
                print("FAIL")
                exit()
        except IndexError:
            pass

# If the queens are not in the same row or diagonal, print success.
print("--> SUCCESS <--")



What do I need to edit to produce a correct output? Code refactoring is appreciated
