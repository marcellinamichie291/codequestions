# Why are these matching unions non-equivalent in Flow?

Link to Flow Try
From this test it looks like Flow can only check union equivalence at the top-level. I would like to know way to fix this error, preferably without a switch statement with every case of the union accounted for.

type BadRequest = {| __typename: 'BadRequest' |} 
type Forbidden = {| __typename: 'Forbidden' |}

type EitherObject = BadRequest | Forbidden
type EitherLiteral = "BadRequest" | "Forbidden"

const eitherLiteral: EitherLiteral = "BadRequest"

const eitherObject: EitherObject = {__typename: eitherLiteral} // Error?
