# Adding React-Slick CSS leads to conflict with Tailwind CSS and destroy base style by tailwind?

[I'm React and Tailwind newbie and this is my first time asking question here].
I have coded a movie-app using tailwind css, after all things done, I added React-Slick in to the Main.Js (Hero section) and it turns out ruining the beautiful style that I have made.
Please help! thanks in advance.
