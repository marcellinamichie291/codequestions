# Bash while read loop with IFS prints only the first line

I have the following source.conf which I am reading in a shell script.
    confFileName:"desktop.conf"
    region:"us-ashburn-1"

The shell script is as follows
#!/bin/bash

file="config/source.conf"

while IFS=: read -r key value unused; do
    echo "$value"
done <$file

When I run this script I am only able to print the first line "desktop.conf". Why is this happening?
