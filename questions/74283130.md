# Removing initial whitespace plus the last empty new line line using python

I am trying to implement a code that prints an 8 by 8 matrix (0 to 63). It should however remove the initial tab spaces and the last empty line. My code is below :
s =''
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        z = i * n + j
        s += ' '
        if z < 10:
            s += ' '
        s += str(z)
    s += '\n'
print(s)


The image Below is also the desired output

I have tried the dedent function but it fails to remove the last line as well
