# How can I change MariaDB to MySQL in XAMPP on Ubuntu OS?

I just realized that xampp(lampp) on my Ubuntu device has the MariaDB as Server type.
I'm going to change the MariaDB Server type to MySQL, so I found these two similar article:

https://gist.github.com/alfhh/92ae13b2592ac654cfe924319259136f
But in my case I have the /opt/lampp/mysql that just have /opt/lampp/mysql/scripts/ctl.sh file. There is not bin and my.ini.

So how is that possible to change the Server type from MariaDB to MySQL in XAMPP
