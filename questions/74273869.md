# Does the fs.readFile() has its own event loop internally?

when I used the fs.readFile() form the below code
fs.readFile('./Data/user.json',(err,data)=>{console.log('I/O')})

I noticed that the file got opened and data read form it and then it closed.
If there is an internal event loop inside this method that is moves to the I/O phase then to the close Callback phase of the event loop and exit the program.
I have tried this code:
fs.readFile('./Data/user.json',(err,data)=\>{console.log('I/O')})

and added to its callback funtion:setTimeout and got the same result
fs.readFile('./Data/user.json',(err,data)=>{
    setTimeout(()=>console.log('timers-1'),0)
    console.log('I/O')
});
