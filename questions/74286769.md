# How to call a View in another folder

I am building my first Asp.net core webservice, that will host a bunch of API's but also must provide a few webpages.
In my home controller I have this code
public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Info()
        {
            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Contact()
        {
            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult AppMessages()
        {
            return View();
        }
        and so on....

This all works well, except fot the last one AppMessages and this is because I would like to have this one in a seperate folder, like this

If I move the file AppMessages.cshtml into the folder Views/Home then it works, but I would like to put this one in a seperate folder because I got a few more to do and I would like to keep them apart from my other Home pages.
How can I do this ?
EDIT
I also tried with putting the folder VLA under the folder Home but it did not help
I always get this error
