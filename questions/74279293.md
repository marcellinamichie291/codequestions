# My date columns are different because of time included in one column but not the other. How do I fix this?

I've tried to use
TO_CHAR(ACTIVE_DT, 'YYYY-MM-DD'),
TO_CHAR(CONTRACT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD')

And then a CASE statement to find out which dates do not match.
However when I do this it's telling me a lot of them don't match when they should because the contract date field has time in it and the active date does not. But I have used TO_CHAR to try and fix it. I'm not sure what else to try.
CASE
    WHEN CONTRACT_DATE = ACTIVE_DT 
        THEN 'Correct' 
    WHEN CONTRACT_DATE <> ACTIVE_DT 
        THEN 'Error' 
    ELSE ' ' END 
AS "QC"
