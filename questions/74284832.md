# I want to receive events from applicationWillTerminate in ReactNative

I want to execute JavaScript code when a ReactNative app is killed, I know that inactive and background can be controlled by AppState in ReactNative, but I can't find any information about when it is killed.
It seems difficult to control in ReactNative, so I would like to send an event with applicationWillTerminate in the iOS lifecycle, listen for that event in ReactNative, and execute the JavaScript code. Is this possible?
I am looking for a way to send the event to ReactNative within applicationWillTerminate in AppDelegate.m but have not found it.
I am also unclear if it is possible to do what I am trying to do in the first place.
