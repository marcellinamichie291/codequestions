# How to make a new column based on condition from multiple columns

I have a dataframe contains a few columns where the value is either 0 or 1




A
B
C
D
E




0
0
0
0
0


0
1
0
0
0


0
0
1
1
0


0
0
0
0
1




So how to create a new column "F" where the condition is :

if column A,B,C,D,E contains 1 so the value of F will be 1.

Here's an example of the expected output




A
B
C
D
E
F




0
0
0
0
0
0


0
1
0
0
0
1


0
0
1
1
0
1


0
0
0
0
1
1




I tried using
def stress(df1):
    if 0 not in ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
    
df1['F'] = df1.apply (stress, axis=1)
df1

but the output became like this




A
B
C
D
E
F

followed by this warning message :
c:\python39\lib\site-packages\pandas\core\frame.py:3607: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead

See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy
  self._set_item(key, value)
