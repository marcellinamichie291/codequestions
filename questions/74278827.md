# How do you include Bootstrap in Razor class library

I'd like to create a razor class library with several components and use that in various Blazor or MAUI Blazor projects. However, these projects have inconsistent Bootstrap versions, and I would like for this class library to have its own Bootstrap version, making it really self-contained.
How to self-contain a specific Bootstrap version withing my Razor class library?
