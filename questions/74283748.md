# How do I scan folders to find a specific file and print the folder name where the file is last copied to? (Java)

For example, I have a file named "test.txt". I copied the file(test.txt) to multiple folders previously i.e., folder names "221031", "221101", "221102".
Now I need to find the location of the file where I last copied it to.
Saying for example that I last copied file (test.txt) to folder "221102", I need the program to print out the file name and last known location of the file. Ex. "File Test.txt was last copied to folder 221102"
I only managed to find the file, but I can't list the folders where it's located in or find where it was last copied to.


File directory = new File("C:\\Users\\asmuhamm\\Documents\\");

        // store all names with same name
        // with/without extension
        String[] flist = directory.list();
        
        int flag = 0;
        if (flist == null) {
            System.out.println("Empty directory.");
        }
        else {

            // Linear search in the array
            for (int i = 0; i < flist.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(Arrays.toString(flist));
                String filename = flist[i];
                if (filename.equalsIgnoreCase("test.txt")) {
                    System.out.println(filename + " found in" + flist[i]);
                    flag = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        if (flag == 0) {
            System.out.println("File Not Found");
        }
    }
}
