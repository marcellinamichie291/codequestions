# How to get only second line using awk

Hello stack overflow community.
Wondering if you can help me with this.
I want to get the available storage space on a computer system and export it to a variable.
I know the command below will give me the available storage on a system.
export HOME=cd;pwd
df -H --output=avail ${HOME}
But it gives me a header of Avail
Avail
891G

I only want the 891G to be exported as a string into a variable.
I tried this command below but it didn't work
df -H --output=avail ${HOME} | awk -F"\n" '{print$1}'

Any thoughts?
