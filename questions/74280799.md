Contains Duplicate (Leetcode question)
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
My solution to the approach was:
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size()-1; i++){
            for(int j=nums.size()-1; j>=0; j--){
                if(nums[i]==nums[j])
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};

can someone tell me what's wrong in it or what would be the improvement. Not every test case is getting passed
