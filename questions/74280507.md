# Spectral Python - No module named 'numpy'

So I am following along with the Spectral python documentation and I have all the required packages and other python dependicies installed yet I keep getting an error that shows:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\asus\OneDrive\Research\My Code\spectrial.py", line 1, in <module>
    import spectral.io.erdas as erdas
  File "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\python3.9\site-packages\spectral\__init__.py", line 21, in 
<module>
    from .utilities.errors import SpyException
  File "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\python3.9\site-packages\spectral\utilities\errors.py", 
  line 3, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'

Here is my Code:
import spectral.io.erdas as erdas
import numpy as np
from spectral import *

img = open_image('photo.lan')

img.__class__
spectral.io.bilfile.BilFile
print(img)

When I run pip show numpy I get this:
Name: numpy
Version: 1.21.3

Is there anything I could be missing for this to keep happening?
