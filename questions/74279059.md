# How to find the name of a row that has the highest value in a column

i am trying to find the name of the row which shows the highest value of a singular column in my data frame, I have tried using
 rownames(which.max(df[,1]))
and
 rownames(df)[apply(df,1,which.ax)]
however the first piece of code only gives me the word 'NULL' and the second piece of code provides me a long list of many row names.
using which.max(df[,1]) provides me with the correct number, but not the corresponding name of the row i am looking for.
Thanks for any help
