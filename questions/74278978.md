# Test Explorer is finding tests, but not running them after upgrading to NUnit3TestAdapter v4.3.0

I'm running Visual Studio Professional 2019 and have many NUnit tests in my project. A few days ago, I updated my NUnitTestAdapter nuget package from 4.2.1 to 4.3.0 and now my Test Explorer does not run any of the tests. It throws no errors and has no problem finding/displaying the tests, but whenever I try to run them, it says:

Test run finished: 0 Tests (0 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Skipped) run in 172.1 ms

I can confirm that rolling back to 4.2.1, cleaning, and rebuilding the project fixes the problem so maybe the issue is a bug in the 4.3.0 package, however I wanted to check if anyone else has this problem or if there is any configuration I need to do in Visual Studio to fix this.
