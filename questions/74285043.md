# java Index 5 out of bounds for length 5 error while doing while loop

I'm trying to switch every odd index character with the nearest even index character to it in a string.
public class A3_Q1 {

    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.print("Enter the messgae you want to be coded: ");
        
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String msg = in.nextLine();
        
        in.close();
        
        msg = msg.trim();
        char msg1[] =  msg.toCharArray();
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index<msg.length()) {
            msg1[index] = msg1[++index];
            index++;
        }
    
        System.out.print(msg1); 
    }

}

I tried searching and asking more experienced friends what's wrong but we don't know bare with us all compsci freshmen
