# checking if an element exists in sqlite database android

I am making an app store. Favorites and shopping cart are implemented through sqlite database. When adding a product to favorites, you need to check if this product is in the table and only then add it.
struct db
public final static String DB_NAME = "store7.db";
public final static int DB_VERSION = 1;

public final static String TABLE_NAME = "likes";
public final static String _ID = "_id";
public final static String ID = "id";
public final static String IMG = "img";
public final static String NAME = "name";
public final static String PRICE = "price";
public final static String OLDPRICE = "oldprice";
public final static String DISC = "disc";
public final static String INFO = "info";
