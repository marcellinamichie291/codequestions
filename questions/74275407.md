# Best way to implement a recycleview where an onclick leads to a new recycleview

I am making a small fitness app where a user is presented with a recycleview of muslce groups (chest, biceps) and when they click on one it leads to a new recycelview containing the exerises for that muscle group. I am using an array of strings and images to populate these recycle views. When the user clicks an exercise it will take them to an acitivity to log the weight and reps. Right now i have a fragment containing that recycelview and the only way i can think to implement it is to have a new activity for every muslce group so my question is: Is there a better way to implment this than having all these different activities for every muscle group?
I tried to have 5 different activities for 5 different recycleview and it just makes the app look like a mess
