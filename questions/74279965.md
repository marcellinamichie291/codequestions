# Vaadin 23 hybrid stateless with JWT and security

I configured my Vaadin application with stateless JWT approach. I use JWT token with Cookie. I implemented this to allow a user session to survive after the application redeploy on the server. Inside the JWT I have the userId value. Also, I have the number of Vaadin Views, but all of them are derived from my BaseView. Inside the constructor of the BaseView I extract userId value from SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() and store it in the BaseView field. So, each time the view is created, I extract userId, query the database for some additional information and store this info in the view. Then, inside the views, typically on button clicks, I do my service call with the userId. I do not have any Spring Security specific logic inside my service methodsâ€¦ I just trust the userId value (that was stored in the BaseView field) received from the Vaadin application.
So my question is - is it a safe approach or I miss something and the system maybe compromised?
