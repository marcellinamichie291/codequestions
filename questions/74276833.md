# Finding instant velocity in python

I'm doing a Python school project where i need to plot graphs based on the"robot" instant velocity, but i don't know how to calculate the instant velocity.
From what I've learned in school, you need to get the function equation and derive it, but i don't know how to calculate this function in python...
For an example, in Excel, you can plot a graph and add a "Trendline" to extract the function equation, as in the example attached.

So my question is, how can i extract this function equation ( f(x) = axÂ² + bx + c) in python (without using excel) ? Or is there another way to calculate instantaneous velocity ?
Thanks in advance,
Caue.
