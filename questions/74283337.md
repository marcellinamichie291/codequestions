# How to link a selected set of files from one directory to another in Linux?

Say for example, in the source directory I have the following files:

abc.r
xyz.sh
pqr.fam
lmn.bim
uvw.r
ttt.sh

Now I need to link only the items 1,2 and 5 only (listed above). Most importantly I need to link all the 3 files together (i.e. link all the 3 files at the same time).
I know how to link 1 file at a time (ln -s sourceDirectory/fileName targetDirectory/), but not multiple files at once.
I found ways to do this when the file name prefixes has some pattern (for example, link all the files where the names start with letter "f"), but in my case, I do not have any such pattern. My file names are different.
