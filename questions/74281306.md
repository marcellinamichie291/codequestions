I am trying to make a game with a leaderboard where everyone can see the scores of other people around the world. When you get a new highscore, it is sent to the "database" and when you click on view scores, it will show you all the high scores currently in the database. I have a domain name and Linux hosting on GoDaddy.
I'm new to this database stuff so all the tutorials I found weren't very helpful.
