# Pdf to html using abcpdf dot net

Basically title. I am trying to convert a pdf into html using AbcPDF
var doc = new WebSupergoo.ABCpdf10.Doc();
doc.Read('your Pdf byte array');
doc.Save('your HTML file path with .html extension');
doc.Clear();
doc.Dispose();

This creates Some.html and a folder called Some that will contain Some.js, Some.css, excanvas-compiled.js and Wingdings_Type0_0.otf
What I want is to combine all of these into the html.`Is it possible to get achieve?
