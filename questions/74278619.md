# type casting works differently for long to int and int to short in java



short t=(short)1 * 3 ;



int tadpole = (int)5 * 2L ;



First statement works perfectly fine, But second throws compilation error.
According to the rules, when performing arithmetic operations, if any byte/short/char will be converted to int by default. So how is first expression working?
also, I checked for


short x = (int) 30; 



int y = (long) 30; 



statement 3 works, but statement 4 doesn't work.
Why can I assign an int to a short, but not long to int?
