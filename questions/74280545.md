# How to filter data through WHERE json statement - postgres

structure of column is> SELECT "starterEntry" FROM "block"
[
  {
    person: {
      firstName: "Koste";
      lastName: "Litaci";
    };
  }
  ...
]

Data type is json, I can't change type or any of the structure of db
What I want to achieve is to select only elements with person firstName = Koste AND lastName = Litaci
what I tried
SELECT "startedByAttendanceEntry" 
FROM "attendance_block" 
WHERE 'person' ->> 'lastName' = 'Litaci' 
  AND 'person' ->> 'firstName' = 'Koste'

and many more all end it with err saying driverError: error: operator is not unique: unknown ->> unknown
