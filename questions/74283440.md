# Where can I find what `export` does internally in Dart?

I have been using the Barrel files strategy to have one single file with several export from the same folder. Then it's easier and cleaner to import one single file than each of the other imports.
I was wondering what does export do internally? and if using it could lead to some performance problems in a Flutter App.
