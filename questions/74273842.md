I have to render a 3d model from a nifti file for this I need to convert it into an object file ( wavefront or Mni ). How can I convert a nifti file to an obj file
I am using brain browser a javascript library to render the 3d image on the browser.
I tried 3d slicer but the segmentation result has a smooth surface
