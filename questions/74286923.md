# Kafka Streams Create Time vs Log-Append Time

If the Kafka broker is configured with Log-Append Time, will the broker overwrite the message timestamp regardless of the timestamp set by the producer/stream?
From streams-time - Documentation, I get the impression that CreateTime is somewhat unreliable - the timestamp is sometimes only forwarded (e.g. when using contecxt.forward()) and sometimes overwritten (e.g. when using puntuate()). I am therefore wondering if the Log-Append Time takes precedence when setting the message timestamp (i.e. overwrites the timestamp set by the stream)?
