# Connect id and English words in cvs files and check co-occurrence relationship between text files and csv files

I would like to link id and English words in 1.csv by id and compare them with 1.txt to find out the number of co-occurring id's and English words.
Co-occurrence condition: Regardless of lower case or upper case, if they are identical, they are considered to be co-occurring.
Co-occurrence is considered if there is agreement up to the plural (s,ies).
example)
             sometime↔SOMETIME ○
             injury↔injuries　 ○
             area↔areas        ○

Output result :Example)
(English word id :Co-occurring English word: Number of co-occurring English words)
D0011  local 6
D0011  rainfall 3
D0022  urban 3
D0022  area  4

(Co-occurring English word id: Number of id's)

D0022  3

1.txt
LOCAL heavy rainfall events often occur in the Baiu and midsummer seasons in Japan.
These rainfall events sometimes cause severe disasters, not only in the rural injuries, but also in the urban areas.

1.csv
D0011,local
D0011,rainfall
D1111,sometime
D1011,disasters
D1011,urban
D0022,Injury
D0022,area

The program will check for co-occurrence relationships between text files and cvs files by linking id's in the cvs files to English words. In addition, we would like to create a program that outputs the number of co-occurring English words and id's.
I did not know how to link id's to English words or how to program co-occurring words in csv and text files.
