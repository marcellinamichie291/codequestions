# Use different PHP version in VSCode workspace PHPStan

I would like to use a different PHP version than my default in my current VScode workspace for PHPstan.
PHPstan keeps using my default PHP version from my windows commandline.
The error I get is;
PHP Fatal error:  Composer detected issues in your platform: Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 8.1.0". You are running 8.0.19.
