# Find the value of a circle with d3js

Hello i am new user of D3js and use version 7, i have a problem to find the value of a circle pointed by the mouse.
I have find it with the following code :
.on("mousemove", (event, d) => {console.log("x10", d); )//WORKING}


inside this code :
d3.selectAll('circle')
  .on('mouseover', function(e, d) {
    d3.select(this)
    //.on("mousemove", (event, d) => {const x10 = console.log(event.currentTarget)+console.log("x10", d.measurement); })//WORKING
    .on("mousemove", (event, d) => {console.log("x10", d); })//WORKING
    //.console.log("A",x10) 
    .style('fill', 'red');
      
  })

and so i can get the information (the value 60.49) i need on the console :
{
    "date": "2022-10-25T21:00:00.000Z",
    "measurement": 60.49
}

but i would like to get the returned value in a var or const, so i have tried this :
.on("mousemove", (event, d) => {var A = console.log("x10", d); })//NOT WORKING`

So if someone of you can help me.Thx
