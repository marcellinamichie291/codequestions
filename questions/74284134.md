# CSS replace text with image or svg

I have two buttons that i want to replace with chevrons.
(https://fontawesome.com/icons/chevron-right?s=solid&f=classic)
.button { visibility:hidden }

.button:after { visibility:visible; content:'>'; font-size: ~+30px }

That's the way i'd do it.
But i would rather replace the buttons with an image / svg, instead of plain " > " characters.
Any solution?
