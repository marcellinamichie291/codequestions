# Inside a 'change' EventListener, can I determine what triggered it? (What was clicked?)

I added an EventListener to all the input elements in my form. Inside the event handler, I validate the input and display an error message if invalid.
const inputDelegate = delegate('input');
forminputs.addEventListener('change', inputDelegate((el) => {
    checkEntry(el.target);
    }
));    

Everything was working fine. But now I added a "show/hide" icon inside the password input box. When the icon is clicked, the typed characters are displayed/hidden.
The problem is that the 'change' event is called first before the onClick event for the icon. But I don't want to verify the password yet, if it's just the icon that was clicked.
Is there a way to check inside the change event handler what was clicked? Or can this be done some other way?
