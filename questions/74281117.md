so im doing a front end challenge and basically i gotta do this and half way through images to move the images but i cant seem to make the cut/overlap
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    display: flex;
    Font-size: 12px;
    font-family: 'Kumbh Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-image: linear-gradient(hsl(273, 75%, 66%), hsl(240, 73%, 65%));
}


.box1 {

    margin-top: 200px;
    margin-bottom: 200px;
    margin-left: 360px;
    margin-right: 360px;
    padding: 200px 30px;
    width: 20%;
    border-radius: 2%;
    background-color: white;
}

.parent {
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}


.womenDesk {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: -57px;
}

.BoxDek {
    position: absolute;
    top: 135px;
    left: -80px;
}

.BGshadowDek {
    position: absolute;
    top: -400px;
    left: -400px;
}

i have tried to use krita and just crop and upload the images as one but it loses resolution(it looks pixelated).i have been thinking using the bodyBG and make that a .png but the white box is there in the middle.
