# How can ı define a char taking from digit of a number in Java?


Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        String num = s.next();

        int a = num.charAt(0);
        int b = num.charAt(1);
        int c = num.charAt(2);
        int d = num.charAt(3);

For example , we can do it like this but i will enter long values ​​for input so how can i write it like loop or easier rather than write 20 line as ı wrote ?
I thought , i can write it using "for" but i couldn't.I am new to java so if you can solve it using basic methods or codes and explain so , i would  be grateful.
Thanks in advance.
