# Converting month in string to numeric in Python

There is a list of dates in a form combining month as a string (e.g, Jan) and date as a number (e.g., 13).
a = ['20January', '14March', '3December', '1May', '17June', '2February']

How can I this list to Month-day format (e.g., 0120, 0314, 1203, ...) using datetime.striptime?
