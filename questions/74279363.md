# Outputting the name of a field as the output in a query?

I've been searching far and wide but can't find any function that helps me for this one. I'm using Impala in a HUE environment and I'm attempting to use a greatest() function to identify a column that is the largest, and then return the name of that column as the output?
I'm not even sure this is entirely possible
For example, if we had the data table containing column A and B with the respective values, then the output field would simply state "Column A" for row 1 and "Column B" for row 2, as those are the columns with the highest value (reading across)




Column A
Column B
OUTPUT




7
2
Column A


3
4
Column B




I have hacked the code using a range of "case when" statements, but obviously this means if any new columns enter the table then the code will fall over. It's also not exactly elegant when scaling this to a table with a few more columns
I was hoping that there would be a function that pulls the name of the field in this situation?
I was experimenting with the "show column stats" call, but that doesn't seem to be helpful for this issue and is really just a red herring.
This is more of a general interest case now, so things like transposing the data isn't a solution as the data has been provided in a specific (unchangeable, apparently) format and we do have a ropey-but-working solution. Was just hoping someone could help to improve my skills!
