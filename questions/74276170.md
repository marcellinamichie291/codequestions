# Proxy server changes the endpoint of response comes from azure active directory

I am a complete novice at SSO, so please let me know if my question dosen't make sense.
Currently we are supporting SP initiates SSO.It is working fine normally but when client use it with proxy server the problem is proxy server changes the endpoint of azure active directory response. So,  Response of AAD can not hit the correct endpoint.But if I install extension named 'My Apps Secure Sign-In Extension' it is working fine.
But it is not correct way to download extension for all the users.
Another way out is to configure application to IDP initiated flow.
So, can we have another way out? If no then please help me how can i transfer from SP to IDP.
