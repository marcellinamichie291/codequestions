# Formula builder and execution widget for workflow and form fields

Does anyone know if there's any open source project which covers pre-computed form fields via the use of a formula builder like this?

In general, something like this is necessary to pre-compute data in a field using other fields (arithmetic or otherwise) and the UI end would be end-user-friendly in the sense that making a formula would be a "minimal code" experience.
Any ideas appreciated. We want to pull this into our workflow automation product - Tallyfy, and ideally begin contributing to the project in question.
