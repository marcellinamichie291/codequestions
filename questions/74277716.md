# Unsupported operation: default SecurityContext getter when connecting with self signed certificate

I have a flutter web app that connects to a HTTPS service that use a self signed certificate. I then added my certificate in my HTTP call as below:
    String url = "$BASE_URL/authenticate/";
    ByteData data = await rootBundle.load('assets/keystore.p12');
    SecurityContext context = SecurityContext.defaultContext;
    context.setTrustedCertificatesBytes(data.buffer.asUint8List(),
        password: "password");
    final httpClient = HttpClient(context: context);

    final client = IOClient(httpClient);

    final response = await client.post(Uri.parse(url),
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: jsonEncode(userObj));

However, I am getting the issue below:
Unsupported operation: default SecurityContext getter
Based on this, the issue is because I am using mqtt_server_client instead of mqtt_server_browser. How do I tell flutter to use the latter?
I also tried bypassing the bad certificate with code below and got a different issue related to the usage of IOClient
 httpClient.badCertificateCallback =
         (X509Certificate cert, String host, int port) => true;

error:
    Unsupported operation: Platform._version
