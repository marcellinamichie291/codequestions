# Promise Chain getting slow after a few seconds

I have a 2000 zip codes list in a .txt file and for each of them I need to make some requests (two or three).
But around 200 lines tested, the script starts to getting very very slow. The first 200 are very fast. Of course I understand that the way I'm doing it, the requests are made in parallel for all the lines of the txt, and I also know that the problem is probably because the promises are not being resolved/killed. How could I resolve this? Does anyone have any good study material on this?
const axios = require('axios')
const chalk = require('chalk')
const fs = require('fs')
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')()

const getLocalization = async (zip) => {
  const config = {
    method: 'get',
    url: `viacep.com.br/ws/${zip}/json`,
  }
  try {
    const res = await axios(config)
    return res
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
  }
}

const getCity = async (zip) => {
  // ... example
}

const main = async (zip) => {
  const disponibility = await getLocalization(zip)
  if (disponibility) {
    getCity(zip)
  } else {
    console.log('ZIP not Found')
  }
}

console.log(chalk.yellow('# Database Path:'))
const filename = prompt('$ ')
const parsered = fs.readFileSync(filename.includes('.txt') ? filename : `${filename}.txt`, 'utf8').split('\n')

for (i = 0; i < parsered.length; i++) {
  const trimmedLine = parsered[i].trim().split('|')[0]
  main(trimmedLine)
}
