# Bulk/Batch update the table of content and figure/tabel captions of MS Word documents

I want to update the table of contents and the figure/table captions of 100+ word documents within one folder on my computer.
Since it takes a lot of time to update all documents by hand, I'd love to find a sollution to execute the update of these documents in batch.
Can anyone help me out with a VBA script to update all the MS Word documents within one folder?
Thanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š
I already managed to do a batch convert from MS Word to PDF by using a VBScript via the following link: https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/how-to-batch-convert-word-documents-into-pdf-files/.
