# how to create a list of a list in photon and print it as columns?

I am new to photon and I would like to know how I can create a list of elements in a list in order to print them on the terminal manually with a number in front of it.
lst = ["country", "inhabitants", "CO2-Emissions" ]

def make_header(lst):
    first_column = []
    for column_names in range(len(lst)):
        first_column.append([])
        for list in range(1):
            column_names[first_column].append(list)
        print(lst) 

make_header(lst)

the output should be:

country
inhabitants
Co2 Emissions

Sadly I have no clue how to do that correctly. Could you give me a hint on that?
I want the columns displayed on the terminal as above.
I am not allowed to use maps, arrays, imports and other "fancy" and practical stuff so I approached for a nested loop.
Kind regards
Boris
