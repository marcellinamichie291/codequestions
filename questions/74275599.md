# Printing integers of list so that the program asks after every number if you want to print the next

"Print the integers of the list [2, 6, 4, 3, 7] so that the program asks after every number "do you want to print the next number (y/n)?" and the program terminates when user inputs n.
I am just starting python out and I cant figure this one out. I am completely lost at the moment and not sure how to even start this, hopefully someone can help
list = 2, 6, 4, 3, 7
n = int(input('Do you want to print the next number y/n?'))
and from here I am stuck, I cant figure out how to move forward
