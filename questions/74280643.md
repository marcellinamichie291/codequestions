# Data transferring issue from wifi connected glasses when mobile data is also active

The problem is this. You need to connect a WiFi camera to your phone and restream to red5pro. I am using this code to connect to internet

NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_CELLULAR
connectivityManager.bindProcessToNetwork(network)

In this case, a problem occurs, the Internet is active, but I do not receive images from the camera. And without this code, on the contrary, I get an image, but I don't have internet.
When using Speedify everything works and I get an image and I have internet.
My question is, is it possible to get the same without using speedify, if so, how?

I tried using Speedify but i need an option to avoid using Speedify
