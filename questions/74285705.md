# Linux screen program to override the terminal's logical rows when reattaching to running screen?

I'm using SecureCRT terminal program in Linux, and it has this setting called "Logical rows", and it's currently set to 58.  My defscrollback is set to 200000 in ~/.screenrc file.
I can use the screen's scrolling feature to see the lines history after reattach.
But when I reattach the running screen, the screen will only display the last 58 lines from the scroll buffer.  I'm assuming that is because the screen is getting the value of 58 from SecureCRT and is only display that many lines.
If keeping the "Logical rows" to 58 in SecureCRT, then is there any way for the screen upon reattach, to show more than 58 lines from the scroll buffer in running session being reattached?  In SecureCRT program, i have its scrollback buffer set to 5000 lines.  So, ideally i would like to see more than just last 58 lines from the screen's scroll buffer during re-attach.  And instead have additional lines beyond the 58 last lines in the screen's scroll buffer during re-attach to just scroll "into" the SecureCRT's own scrollback buffer.
Tried using the "height" set to 500 in the ~/.screenrc but does not work, still stuck at only showing last 58 lines from the scroll buffer.
