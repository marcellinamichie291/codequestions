# Querying the attribute of first child of an xml element using xPath

I'm having the following small snippet:
[xml]$doc = (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://www.jetbrains.com/updates/updates.xml")

$xPath = "//product[@name='IntelliJ IDEA']//channel[@id='IC-IU-RELEASE-licensing-RELEASE']//[1]"
$node = $doc | Select-XML -XPath $xPath 

The idea is to get the latest build version for IntelliJ using the above xPath. I am interested in the line
<build number="222.4345" version="2022.2.3" releaseDate="20220726" fullNumber="222.4345.14">

and want to extract the version attribute.
Using the above xPath //product[@name='IntelliJ IDEA']//channel[@id='IC-IU-RELEASE-licensing-RELEASE']//[1] I am getting back all builds.
Switching to //product[@name='IntelliJ IDEA']//channel[@id='IC-IU-RELEASE-licensing-RELEASE']//build[1] I indeed getting the first build, but without the actual build node, which would yield the version attribute.
If I want to simply iterate over all versions using $doc | Select-XML -XPath $xPath | ForEach-Object { $_.Node.version }  I am getting an empty result back. My mistake must be something trivial, but I am at a total loss.
What is the correct syntax for getting the first build node here?
