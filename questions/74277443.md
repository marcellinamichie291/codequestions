I'm trying to call id in the api but the method I use is not working.

 <body>
        <form action="" method="POST" >
            <input type="text" id="suggest" name="keywords" placeholder="search....." required/>
            <button name="keys_submit"> search </button>
        </form> 
        
        <script>
          var val = document.getElementById("suggest");
        </script>

            <?php
             $ch=curl_init();
             $url="http://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?output=chrome&q=#suggest";

    

I am trying to call id in this api("http://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?output=chrome&q=**'#suggest'**") but it taking it as a string.
when i enter any value in the search box but its not responding because id is not working(not calling properly).
