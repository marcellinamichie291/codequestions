# How would I write a MIPS behavioral simulator for the machine code created using the assembler code provided?

This MIPS simulator will read in a text file consisting of LC3100 machine code instructions (represented as decimal values), and execute the program, then display the values of register files and memory after each instruction is completed.
I do not understand how this can be done and simply need a format for what steps I need to take in order to create the simulator in MIPS. Do I write code in C++ or write the code in MIPS? How do I read files if it is in MIPS? Honestly, just confused.
I do not know where I need to start from. This is what I am asking to help figure out.
