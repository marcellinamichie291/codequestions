# What is the correct choice for this Java Recursion Question

Hi I am studying AP CS now and wondering what is the answer for the following question?? Really Appreciate if you can help me understand this question.
Consider the following instance variable and method. private int[] arr;
/** Precondition: arr contains no duplicates; the elements in arr are in ascending order. 
@param low an int value such that 0 <= low <= arr.length 
@param high an int value such that low - 1 <= high < arr.length 
@param num an int value */
public int mystery(int low, int high, int num){
int mid = (low + high) / 2;
if (low > high) {
return low;
} else if (arr[mid] < num) {
return mystery(mid + 1, high, num);
} else if (arr[mid] > num) {
return mystery(low, mid− 1, num);
} else // arr[mid] == num 
{
return mid;}
}

What is returned by the call mystery(0, arr.length − 1, num)?
 A The number of elements in arr that are less than num
 B The number of elements in arr that are less than or equal to num
 C The number of elements in arr that are equal to num
 D The number of elements in arr that are greater than num
 E The index of the middle element in arr
