# ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'parted'

Trying to create a partitionf and mountpoint on the Azure Disks, which are getting attached to VM on creation as part of terraform. Disks should be created based on input user through Jenkins.
Each disk was passed with a LUN number and I am fetching the device name(sdc,sdd etc.) for each disk using that LUN number and grep. In my_tasks.yml and this tasks to be looped with include_tasks in playbook.yml as below:
my_tasks.yml
---
- name: Generate the Volume_Name
  shell: echo "/dev/$(ls -l /dev/disk/azure/scsi1 |grep "{{ item.lun }}" |egrep -o "([^\/]+$)")"
  register: volumename
  set_fact:
    volumenames: "{{ volumenames|default([]) + [ { 'name': volumename.stdout } ] }}"

- debug:
    msg: "VOLUMENAME is: {{ volumename.stdout }}"

- parted:
    device: "{{ volumename.stdout }}"
    number: 1
    state: present
- filesystem:
    fstype: xfs
    dev: "{{ volumename.stdout }}"
- mount:
    fstype: xfs
    opts: noatime
    src: "{{ volumename.stdout }}"
    path: "{{ item.mountpoint }}"
    state: mounted
- command: blkid -s UUID -o value {{ volumename.stdout }}
  register: volumename_disk

- blockinfile:
    path: /etc/fstab
    state: present
    block: |
      UUID={{ volumename_disk.stdout }}   {{ volumename.stdout }}      xfs defaults,noatime,nofail 0 0

ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'parted'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path. The error appears to be in '/home/xyz/my_tasks.yml': line 21, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

How can I resolve this issue or improve the code?
