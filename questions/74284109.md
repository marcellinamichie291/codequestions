# R merge_element() error with no apparent reason (ggplot2)

So here is a very short example for the code:
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x=wt,y=mpg,group=1))+
  geom_point()+geom_line()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_rect(fill = "grey"),
        axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"))

Error in `**merge_element()**`:
! Only elements of the same class can be merged
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

This is such an annoying error, and I also tried other solutions in the forum but it really seems like something R folks should take care of. This error is prevented by adding a simple theme_bw() (or alike) argument, but it then cancels the text argument within theme()
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x=wt,y=mpg,group=1))+
  geom_point()+geom_line()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_rect(fill = "grey"),
        axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"))+
  theme_minimal()

This works but doesnt apply the axis.text.
Any suggestions?
I excepted to get a figure with bolded text on the axes, and it never happend
