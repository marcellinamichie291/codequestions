# How to add the opening cash balance with the total opening sales?

I have the following table where the seller id_seller performs the opening with the start date of activities and the opening balance. It will be known that this box is open by having the status at 0:
tbl_cashier:

Taking into account the opening date of the box, I need to list the total sales that the seller has made from its opening date until the seller closes his box:
tbl_invoice:

Considering the above, prepare the following query:
SELECT
ca.id_cashier,
ca.open_date,
ca.open_amount,
ca.close_date,
ca.open_amount + SUM(i.amount_total) AS total_amount,
ca.status
FROM tbl_cashier ca
LEFT JOIN tbl_invoice i ON ca.id_seller=i.id_seller
WHERE ca.id_seller=6
AND i.payer_date BETWEEN ca.open_date AND ca.close_date
GROUP BY ca.id_cashier

Having the following output:

The result is correct since it adds the initial opening balance 100.00 + the two sales that were made from the beginning to the closing 10.00 + 10.10, this gives us an equal of 120.10
Now the problem is that I need both records to be shown, that is, the closed box and the open box of the tbl_cashier table and when adding this WHERE i.payer_date BETWEEN ca.open_date AND ca.close_date condition it only shows me the records of the closed boxes, then, Â¿ How can I show both data?
I tried adding this condition but I can't get the open box in the query listing:
AND i.payer_date BETWEEN ca.open_date AND ca.close_date OR i.payer_date BETWEEN ca.open_date AND ca.open_date
