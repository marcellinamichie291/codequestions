# Azure Purge Command not deleting images

I'm trying to delete TAGGED images in ACR using the below command. But it says 0 deleted images. There are around 100+ images older than 90 days.
Number of deleted tags: 0

$REGISTRY = "MYREGISTRY"
$PURGE_CMD = "acr purge --filter 'MYREPO:.*' --ago 90d "
az acr run --cmd $PURGE_CMD --registry $REGISTRY /dev/null

The images in the ACR does have tags
