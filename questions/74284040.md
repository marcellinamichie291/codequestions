# textfsm.parser.TextFSMError: State Error raised

I am still leaning python and Nornir for network automation as a network engineer.
I am scripting to find any BGP issue from multiple devices with Nornir using "TextFSM".
The python with nornir works correctly without "TextFSM.

I get an error message when TextFSM is used for parsing.

I searched and spent time a lot to find the reason of this issue.
Half of the network devices I am managing has the issue with "TextFSM" at present.
Could you please advise me where I can start to fix this issue?
Thank you.
I get the output with netmiko like below
output = net_connect.send_command('show ip bgp summary')
Here is the output of "print(repr(output))
