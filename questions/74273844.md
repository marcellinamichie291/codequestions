# Prophet giving out of bounds predictions

I'm using facebook's prophet model for making the predictions.
I'm performing the log transformation on the target feature and then training the model.
df_train["item_demand_log"] = np.log(1+df_train["item_demand"])

Then I'm defining the model in this manner:
pr = Prophet(yearly_seasonality=False, weekly_seasonality=False, daily_seasonality=False, 
                 seasonality_mode='additive',
                 growth = 'linear',
                 n_changepoints = 10,
                 changepoint_prior_scale= 0.3,
                 seasonality_prior_scale= 10, 
                 changepoint_range=1
                ).add_seasonality(
                    name = 'weekly',
                    period = 7,
                    fourier_order = 12
                )
pr.add_country_holidays(country_name='IN')
for reg in all_regressors:
    pr.add_regressor(reg)

Then after taking the predictions, I'm taking the exponent of predictions such as:
    df_preds["prediction"] = np.exp(df_preds["prediction"]) - 1

Reason for performing log transformation: It gives better predictions for most of our time-series, but for some of them, it's going out of bounds.
But the predictions are going crazy; it's giving out-of-bound predictions; how to fix this issue?
What changepoint range should I consider?
But the plot is shown below:
