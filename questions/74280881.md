# Android spam filter

I'm trying to create an app that acts as a SMS spam filter.
The idea is to receive the message, process it through a backend call and then mark it as spam or leave it in the inbox.
My major blocker is that i don't want to ask for the default SMS handler permission on my app since i just want to build a spam blocker not an entire messaging app, but i think the only way to access sms is through the SMS Content Resolver.
Is it doable to create a spam blocker without being the default SMS app?
