# Poetry Upgrade Project from Python 3.10.x to Python 3.11.0

I have a poetry based Django project using Python 3.10.2. I would like to upgrade the project to use Python 3.11.0.
What is the proper way to do that?
Should I nuke poetry.lock then update the pyproject.toml to
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"

The ability to easily upgrade to newer versions of Python seems like it should be a core feature but I don't see a command to automate the process.
