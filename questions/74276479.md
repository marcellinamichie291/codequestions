I am creating a Google Sheet system to replace a piece of major information storage for my company. I know nothing about coding, just excel functionality. Google does not have a well done in-built email notification function. I have included a sample spreadsheet, my boss wants to get an email when Project East gets moved from the Bidding Sheet to the Pending Sheet without having to be mentioned in a comment. The issue comes when we have multiple people moving things, he doesn't want to get an email for when everything is assigned or moved. I don't know if there is a script that I can add to make that automated. All of the plug-ins I have tried cannot handle the stack required.
I haver tried the reputable plugins from the google plugin store and hey cannot handle more than one triggered event. I have multiple people that would need separate emails set to different triggers.
