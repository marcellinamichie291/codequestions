# My javascript is only working on 1st variation attribute and not on all

This is my javascript code which I have written in functions.php and this code is working perfect but only on 1st variation. I have tried this to open 2nd variation first after reload but it didn't work. It is working on every first variation of every product. Kindly help me out with this code.
add_action('admin_footer', 'script');
function script()
{
    ?>
    <script>
        jQuery(function ($) {
            jQuery('#woocommerce-product-data').on('woocommerce_variations_loaded', function () {
                jQuery(this).find('.woocommerce_variation').each(function () {
                    jQuery("#dp").keydown(function () {
                        var cost = document.getElementById("cost").value;
                        var dp = document.getElementById("dp").value;
                        console.log(dp);
                    });
                });
            });
        });
