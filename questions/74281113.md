# Discord bot (JS) messageReactionAdd not working

I am building a Discord bot using JS. Now I want to add reaction roles.
The event messageReactionAdd does not work for me. This is my code:
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits, EmbedBuilder } = require('discord.js')
const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMembers,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessageReactions,
  ]
})

client.on('messageReactionAdd', (reaction, user) => {
  console.log('Message react');
});

It looks very simple but I don't know what I am doing wrong.
