# How to reduce/optimize api call when initial a bloc

I have a navbar, change between 2 screens nested with Provider create blocs. Whenever bloc constructor called. It's call api to get data and add to the stream. So the problem here, user can spam switch between 2 screens and make the bloc dispose and init => api was called multiple times.
Class Bloc1 {
  const Bloc1(){
    data = await fetch() //Call api
    stream1.add(data) //Then add to stream
 }
}

I have tried the lock. But it does not work because when recreate, the lock is recreate too -> useless.
Class Bloc1{
 var lock = false;
 const Bloc1(){
   if(lock == false) {
     data = await fetch() //Call api
     stream1.add(data) //Then add to stream
   }
 }
}
