# Node.js / Express , page not loading

I am doing a PluralSight tutorial on Node.Js / Express, when I try to load up my admin router page it just loads forever , no error message or anything appears. It is set to run on localhost:4000 . The other router file I created seems to work fine.
Link to the Github here: https://github.com/maxm2017/C-Users-mmerc-OneDrive-Pluralsight-Building-Web-Applications-with-Node.js-and-Express/blob/main/src/routers/adminRouter.js
Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks
