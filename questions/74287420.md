# Why is there reduction in Turnaround time in higher CPU config, but no change in CPU utilization?

I am running a kubernetes cluster to expose a flask service that runs a Yolov3 model.
If the pod configuration is 2 cpu, it runs much faster (~1.5sec) compared to 700m cpu, which takes ~3.5 seconds.
The strange thing is there is no change in CPU utilization.
I am attaching the graph where the scale up of CPU happened with no change in utlization.
It is not a yolo thing, because the same thing is happening in other frameworks like pytorch as well.
Any ideas on how to proceed further will be helpful. I can modify the question as per what other details are required.
