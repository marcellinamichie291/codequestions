# In Jinja how to access Macro parameters in a set block?

Hi all I'm currently writing Jinja macro that runs a sql query based on some parameters passed to it.
I'm having some issue with the macro definition itself. I cannot find a way to use the macros paramters within the set block. It interprets the value as literally 'col1' not the value stored in it.
How can I use the value stored in it?
How I run the macro:
WITH DRIVER 
AS(
    SELECT
    'apple' as col1
)

SELECT
    {{ select_test('col1') }} as output
FROM
    DRIVER

The macro definition is shown below:
{% macro select_test(val1) %}

    {% set query_to_run%}
        select
         concat({{ val1)}},'banana')
    {% endset %}

    {% set results = run_query(query_to_run) %}

    {% if execute %}
    {# Return the first column #}
    {% set results_list = results.columns[0].values() %}
    {% else %}
    {% set results_list = [] %}
    {% endif %}

    {{ return(results_list) }}

{% endmacro %}


I currently get the following output:
col1banana
My expected output:
applebanana
