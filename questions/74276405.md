How do I handle using select2 with ModelChoiceField, but enable adding a new record
I have the Select2 JS in place, and everything works well.  I can use my queryset for the ModelChoiceField, and that works.  However, if I try to add a new record all I get is the error "Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices".  Which is true - in the view I tried to grab "ID 0" to then create a new record, but can't get past validation without the above error
Also, if I do get this to work, it will provide the "0" ID, but ultimately I require the "term" for the new record, but can't see how this is done
<script type="text/javascript">
    $("#id_indoor_cooler").select2({
      theme:"bootstrap4",
      search_fields: ['model_number'],
      tags: true,
      createTag: function (params) {
          var term = $.trim(params.term);

          if (term === '') {
              return null;
          }

          return {
              id: 0,
              text: term,
              newTag: true, // add additional parameters,
              value: "myCustomValue"
          }
      }
    });
</script>
