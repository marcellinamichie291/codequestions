# TypeError: i.createObjectURL is not a function

I have a question, I need to export files of any type (pdf, txt, xlsx), but no matter what, I always get this error when I try to use this function, I put a simple example of a file that should be able to download as a test:
  var blob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], { type: 'text/plain;charset=utf-8' })
  saveAs(blob, 'hello.txt')

the saveAs function I get it from the 'file-saver' library.
