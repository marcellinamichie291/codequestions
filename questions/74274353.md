# Create wordcloud with conditions from dataframe in R

I have a dataframe structured as such:
df<-data.frame(Topic=c("Technology","Technology","Technology","Technology","Social","Social","Social","Social"),
               Area=c("General","General","Specific","Specific","General","General","Specific","Specific"),
               Answer=c("Be at miss or each good play home they. It leave taste mr in it fancy. She son lose does fond bred gave lady get. Sir her company conduct expense bed any. Sister depend change off piqued one. Contented continued any happiness instantly objection yet her allowance. Use correct day new brought tedious.",
                        "Consulted perpetual of pronounce me delivered. Too months nay end change relied who beauty wishes matter.",
                        "Especially do at he possession insensible sympathize boisterous it. Songs he on an widen me event truth. Certain law age brother sending amongst why covered.",
                        "Maids table how learn drift but purse stand yet set. Music me house could among oh as their. Piqued our sister shy nature almost his wicket. Hand dear so we hour to. He we be hastily offence effects he service. Sympathize it projection ye insipidity celebrated my pianoforte indulgence. Point his truth put style."))


And I want to create a wordcloud from the Answer column based on one condition (for example, considering only answers from Technology topic) or multiple conditions (for example, only answers for Technology and General respondents).
Ideally, I would like words in the wordcloud to change color based on the condition (e.g., if a word is mentioned in Technology, make it blue etc.)
I looked up some solutions but they all start from a .txt or .doc file, and I would prefer to avoid copying my whole response table in a .txt or Word file. Up until now I used the wordcloud package.
Is there a way to create a wordcloud with conditions directly from a dataframe like mine? Thanks in advance!
