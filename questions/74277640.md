# I need an optional answer for this code. (Exercise for Switch statements) (C)

I have learned switch statements and i need some help on this exercise. Im working on programming exercise, in this one i had a problem with prompting char value from user.When i promted data, code is taking "enter" from past prompts as value. This causes code to display the answer of "default case". I find a way to prevent this by using "%*c" on scanf. But i have questions.
I'm using replit for writing code, here is the link if you need it: https://replit.com/languages/c
//Information
Exercise wants astronaut to be;
1-Non-smoker.
2-Between age, 26 to 46 years old.
3-Between weights, 110 to 220 pounds.


// Coding

/* INCORRECT CODING */
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
double opt_min = 110; /* Min. astronaut weight in pounds */
double opt_max = 220; /* Max. astronaut weight in pounds */
double weight;
  printf("Enter weight of astronaut in pounds> ");
  scanf("%lf", &weight);
double age_min = 26;
double age_max = 46;
double age;
  printf("Enter age of astronaut> ");
  scanf("%lf", &age);

if(
  (weight >= opt_min && weight <= opt_max)
  &&(age >= age_min && age <=age_max)
  )
{
}
else
{
  printf("You haven't granted for being an astronaut.");
  return 0;
} 
  
char smokingCondition;
  printf("Type 'Y' or 'N' depends on if you are smoker>\n ");
  scanf("%c", &smokingCondition);
  
switch (smokingCondition)
  {
    case'Y':
    printf("You haven't been granted for being an astronaut.\n");
    break;

    case'N':
    printf("You have granted for being an astronaut.\n");
    break;

    default:
    printf("You have entered invalid letter.\n");
    break;
  }
  return 0;
}

What i need to learn is "Can we prevent this by using another way?" Is there optional answer for this?

4-"N" is the "true" value for if the person is smoking.
