# VueJs Sorting using loadash

I am using sortBy using lodash. Here is the function
import { sortBy } from 'lodash.sortby';

computed: {
    visibleInsights() {
      return sortBy(this.insights.filter(insight => {
        const id = this.getInsightId(insight);
        return !this.hiddenInsights.includes(id);
      }), ['insightType.attribute']);
    },
  },


I 'm basically trying to sort this before rendering. But I am facing the error due to this function. is there any other way to write it down to resolve the issue. above is the written code which i am trying to execute.
