I'm using R and python in google colab , but for now it doesn't work anymore and i don't know what is the solution :
for the code is :
%load_ext rpy2.ipython

%%R
x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=50)
x

I have tried that and it doesn't work anymore
the error:
NotImplementedError: Conversion 'py2rpy' not defined for objects of type '<class 'str'>'
