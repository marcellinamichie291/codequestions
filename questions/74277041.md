# relative order, sort change


The rendering order of images can be changed by user. I want to recalculate the pixels only if two images changed position between them.
The images can change position in groups(without changing inner order). Which is a gaps and islands problem.
indexing groups
SUM(CASE WHEN lagged_new_sort_mines_old_sort = new_sort - old_sort)
grouping vectoral geometry and placements
 MIN(new_sort), MIN(old_sort), ST_UNION(geom)
then used DENSE_RANK to have ordered view
 DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY new_sort) AS new_order
 DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY old_sort) AS old_order
The problem: When an order changes it shifts the queue.
Pay attention to row 17. The old third took the place of old second.
Pay attention to row 31. It looks like unchanged but its relative placement dropped by 15 image groups (old_order of [1-4] is above 200)
I got stuck and lost my view.
I need the indexes of group geometries that I need to get overlaped area
