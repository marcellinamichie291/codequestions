# How Do I Convert a yuv420 Video File to 16-bit (using ffmpeg)?

As the title says, my video file has 12-bit depth and I want to convert it to 16-bit. I dont care which yuv pixel format, as long as its 16 bit. I have installed ffmpeg and I can't figure out what combination of arguments to use to convert it. The video file is very small: 20 frames at 352x288.
This is the command I have been trying, but the file size is the same number of bytes as the original:
ffmpeg -video_size 352x288 -pixel_format yuv420p -sample_fmt s16 -i inpput.yuv output.yuv

If there is another way to do this without ffmpeg, I am open to any suggestions. Thanks in advance!
