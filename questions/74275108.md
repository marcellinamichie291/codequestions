function format( $value ) {
if( ! empty( $value ) ) :
    $value = floatval( trim( str_replace( ' (l/100 km)', '', $value ) ) );
endif;

return $value;
}

Got the following function for importing a CSV with WP All Import. Would like to change the above function that 0 is given out, when no entry is found.
How to achive that?
