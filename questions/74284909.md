# Progress Bar around rectangular view in Android using canvas and ObjectAnimator

Can anyone please help me, I am trying to create a progress bar around rectangular view which is white in start and turns green with the elapsed timer.
I have tried SquareProgress Bar by mrwonderman but it can only be applied on images, i want to apply it around view in xml.
I want a rectangular progress bar that should be around a view, progress bar should be of 60 seconds.
