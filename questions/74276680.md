# Understanding select cases with timeout in Go

I have trouble understanding why the following code blocks:
func (n *node) test(dest string, msg string, timeout time.Duration) ([]byte, error) {
    dataChannel := make(chan []byte, 1)
    // Send a message to another process and launch go function which receives data on dataChannel
    send(dest, msg, dataChannel)

    select {
    case res := <-dataChannel:
        return res, nil
    case <-time.After(timeout):
        return nil, os.ErrDeadlineExceeded
    }
}



I want a blocking send that waits for an answer until it gets it or until timeout. However when the timeout occurs, the function returns but the process blocks indefinitely.
Can this select block if the timeout case triggers (namely because of the dataChannel)? Or should I look somewhere else in my code?
