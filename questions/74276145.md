# React Native: Accessing system date and time

CAUTION: this is not duplicate of this question
In my application - it's an audio book app - users can listen 4 books without any ads, or pop-up (a.k.a premium), after finishing 4 books, for next 20 days, you (as a user) see ads, pop-ups and so on. But there's an old school method: if you change your system date,  you don't have to wait for 20 days.
I've fixed this problem, but I'm curious, is there any way to access users system date?
