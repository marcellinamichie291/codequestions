I have an array of objects
const test = [{id: 9}, {id: 2}, {id: 4}]

So I need to map this array by id
const newTest = test.map(el => el.id)

But after the map I have sorted the array like:
[2, 4, 9]

How can I save the order of elements like was in the original array and get this?
[9, 2, 4]
