# Downloading a torrent file in android

I would like to download torrent files using my application (something without using other applications that are on the phone like webTorrent, uTorrent, etc).
I will be very grateful if you tell me a good library or how to implement the most torrent file download.
On GitHub, I found a few   libraries that could solve my problem, but they are no longer supported.
