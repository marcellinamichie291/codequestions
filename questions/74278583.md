# How to call Google Drive API from Cloud Function for Firebase on behalf of a user?

I want to interact with the Google's Drive API from a Cloud Function for Firebase. For authentication / authorization, I am currently relying on getClient, which I believe uses the Service Account exposed in the Cloud Function environment:
import { google } from 'googleapis';

// Within the Cloud Function body:
const auth = await google.auth.getClient({
  scopes: [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file',
  ],
});
const driveAPI = google.drive({ version: 'v3', auth });

// read files, create file etc. using `driveAPI`...

The above approach works, as long as target directories / files list the email address of the service account as an editor.
However, I'd like to interact with the Drive API on behalf of another user (which I control), so that this user becomes (for example) the owner of files being created. How can I achieve this?
