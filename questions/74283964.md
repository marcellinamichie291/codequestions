# C++ Function Defined in Lib, But Referenced Through DLL

I'm using Visual Studio 2022.
I have a function foo() in a static library called MyLib.
void foo();

I have a DLL MyDLL which references MyLib.  It does not make any calls to foo().
I have an executable which loads the DLL.  When I try to access the function foo() from the executable, it returns NULL.
void* pFoo = GetProcAddress(hMyTestDll, "foo");
if (pFoo)
{
    // Call pFoo()
}
else
{
    throw "foo() not found";
}

I understand the function needs to be exported.  But, is there a way I can make the executable know that foo() (from the static library) exists without writing the function in the DLL?  Can you export functions from the DLL if they were defined in a .lib that it references?
