# Offer a discount to a user paying with venmo

We want to enable customers to get discounts through our website. I'm curious whether we can support a discount flow when a customer pays with venmo, specifically.
The situation: a customer comes with a $10 discount to our marketplace website. The $10 discount is paid for by the site, and not the merchant. The customer finds a merchant that they like, and the two agree upon a sticker price of $100. The customer should therefore pay $90, and the merchant should earn $100.
Is it possible to ensure that the customer pays $90, and the merchant earns $100?
No details on the venmo / paypal integration page whether it would be possible to send the merchant $10 separately
