# Mongoose: filter data if value exists in array

I'm trying to filter a collection to obtain a document that matches with a value(provided by the user) in the 'employeeCode' array field.
The collection I'm working with looks like this;
[
    {
        "employeeCode": [
            "Fli-2022-650"
        ],
        "wages": 200,
        "allowance": 0,
        "overtime": 0,
},
{
        "employeeCode": [
            "Fli-2022-225"
        ],
        "wages": 200,
        "allowance": 0,
        "overtime": 0,
}
]

And here is my controller
exports.connect = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  const code = req.params.code;


  Employee.aggregate([
  
    {
      "$match": {
        "employeeCode": code,
     
      }
    }
  ]).exec((err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      
     res.send(result);
    }
  })
});


Whenever i run the code, i get an empty array.I want to return only documents that match
