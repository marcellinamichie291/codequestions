# How can I get Map<String, Records> from Map<String, List<Records>>

This is code I have tried:
Map<LocalDate, List<Records>> outputs = new HashMap<>();

Map<String, List<Records>> prevDateData = outputs.get(currentDate.minusDays(1))
                                .stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Records::getId));

But I want to achieve data structure from outputs:
Map<String, Records> prevDateData

Can someone suggest how I could do that?
