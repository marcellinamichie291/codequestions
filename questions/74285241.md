# git push error: dst refspec refs/heads/main matches more than one

At the moment I'm forced to push to a new branch on every change I make. And that branch must be deleted since the error appears again on every newly created branch.
git push origin main gives the following output
error: dst refspec refs/heads/main matches more than one
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/CarloCattano/fastesTube'

My git tag outputs:
refs/heads/dev
refs/heads/dev2
refs/heads/dev3
refs/heads/main
v1.1
win64 

no matter if I manually delete them with -d.
Even tried to migrate the project to a new repo , and the problem persists after a few pushes.

Force pushing also doesn't seem to work.
It might be I wrongly configured the .yml file and creates tags for every release.
