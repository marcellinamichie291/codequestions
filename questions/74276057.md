# UNPIVOT in sql server with two input values (converting from Oracle to sql server)

in Oracle I have written a statement where I use UNPIVOT. That part looks like this:
unpivot ((value, prev_value) for col in ( 
(title, prev_title)      as 'title'                                                              , (stage, prev_stage)    as 'stage'                                                              , (value, prev_value)    as 'value'

Till now I am not able to find a way of doing the same with sql server. Any suggestionsl
