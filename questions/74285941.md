# On Android, what does "kill process" mean?

While running a Compose codelab (basics), I encountered these sentences:

Instead of using remember you can use rememberSaveable. This will save
each state surviving configuration changes (such as rotations) and
process death. ... Run, rotate, change to dark mode or kill the
process. The onboarding screen is not shown unless you have previously
exited the app.

My initial reaction to "process death" was that the author was referring to how Android will arbitrarily just kill an app process when it needs resources. I do not believe this is something a User can make happen, as opposed to exiting an app.
Then the author says "Run, rotate or kill the process" which makes me think there does exist a way for a User to kill the process without exiting the app. Is there a way to kill an app process using some gesture or recipe other than swiping to exit the app, or using force close from the Settings app?
A good answer to my question would allow me to either test my code using the supposed kill process mechanism or inform the author that the codelab documentation is a little loose and might be tightened up.
