# PM2 cluster mode run multiple redis pub/sub clients

I try to use PM2 cluster mode to run multiple redis pub/sub clients. However, the clients can not connect successfully. If I just use PM2 fork mode, the redis pub/sub clients works well.
I tried to find the solution, but I can'f find any useful information. Any person encountered the same situation?
