# How to parse raw html element in R or Python?

For instance in this website: https://www.amazon.com/Lexani-LXUHP-207-All-Season-Radial-Tire-245/dp/B07FFH8F9V/
So I say "inspect" and I find the element that I'm interested:
<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">        Lexani LXUHP-207 Performance Radial Tire - 245/45R18 100W       </span>

Here's the deal, I want to copy the entire thing. Not just the "Lexani LXUHP-207 Performance Radial Tire - 245/45R18 100W" text title of the product. Can someone tell me how can I do this in beatifulsoup or rvest?
I am learning Python and R and I tried to dig it in but couldn't get a raw result.
