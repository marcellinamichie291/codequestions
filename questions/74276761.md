# Option+Shift+5 executes a keyboard shortcut instead of "[" in Visual Studio - AZERTY Keyboard

I was wondering if someone has Visual Studio installed on macOS and has a keyboard shortcut executed when typing a square bracket with an AZERTY keyboard.
I tried changing my keyboard configuration in Visual Studio, but nothing changes (I went from Visual Studio for Mac, to ReShaper/Rider, to Xcode and finally the personalized keyboard configuration).
I am also trying to find the shortcut (in Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts) to delete it, but I am not having any success at the moment.
Thank you.
