# How can i set up ngrok to work with wss protocol

I have ngrok installed on my desktop, which i usually run using this line ngrok http 80
It works as intended, and i get the url i paste into a websocket client on web. The problem here is that it won’t run, because the site, which is the client is set on a https domain. The client requires wss:/… connection. When i try and set the websocket url aswss://ngroklink it just isn’t available.
P.S. I run the websocket from a python script on my local machine.
