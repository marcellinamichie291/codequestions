# How to disable back/forward cache in reactjs?

Well, my question is simple, as the title says I'm trying to figure out how to disable the cache in my react app. I'm having a problem with it because when it loads it doesn't execute any js code.....
I hope someone can help me and thanks in advance!
I expect that when I click on my react application, all the JS code will run and no cache will be loaded.
