# Creating pointers inside the heap allocated/ malloced memory

I am trying to create a chunk of heap allocated memory to which I can assign objects of multiple types using void pointers. However, my intent is to use the first couple of memory addresses for metadata. I assume that these first couple of blocks would be holding addresses referring to the start, end, and amount of free space in the block. As a result, these would have to be pointers. Therefore, I would have to cast my void pointer and in turn dereference that to store another pointer, but I am unsure of the syntax. Is there any document that I could refer to or existing code that would point me in the right direction. I am rather new to the concept of storing metadata, hence my ignorance. Any advice would be very helpful.
I have looked around for resources but have not found any
