# GitHub Actions | Monitor a workflow run

I am trying to understand what will be the best way to monitor a GitHub actions workflow.
I have a workflow that runs independently with a cron schedule and I want to monitor the runs of the workflow, I need to get an alert if the workflow didn't run for over a week.
We use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor our cloud (aws).
What do you recommend as the best solution?
Thank you!
I thought about sending a metrics to cloud watch on every run, but thought there might be a more straight forward way.
