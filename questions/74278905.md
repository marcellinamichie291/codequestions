# How to speed up sass with a lot of files?

I have a project with around 1000 SCSS files. And I want to compile them with Webpack and sass-loader. But there's a problem - it takes 20 minutes to do it. Right now all my files concatenate, so SASS need to compile only 1 file. And compilation time of 1 file is much faster than for 1000 files. But I don't like the current solution - it's self-written and it does have a lot of other problems except the compilation time.
Is there a way to handle that big number of SASS files?
