# EFCore: How to detect which of the newly added entity's properties have changed since the dbContext Attach or Add happened?

In an app that makes use of EFCore and a dbContext,
class Person
{
int Id;
string LastName;
string FirstName;
DateOnly DOB;
DateTime CreatedDateTime;
DateTime UpdatedDateTime;
}

To add a new entity I use
var p = new Person();
db.Context.Attach<Person>(p);

then some of the newly added entity's properties are changed.
Then I want to call SaveChanges() only if some of the properties of the "p" entry have changed otherwise I would like to detach the "p" entry and not SaveChanges!!
I am wondering if there is a proper way of knowing which (if any) of the properties have changed so to decide if the entry should be saved or discarded.
I would appreciate for your help
What I have tried so far is
 dbContext.Attach(p);

 if (dbContext.ChangeTracker.HasChanges())
 {
        dbContext.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges();
        Debug.WriteLine(_dbContext.ChangeTracker.DebugView.ShortView);
        Debug.WriteLine(_dbContext.ChangeTracker.DebugView.LongView);
}

The only result I get is that the entity always has changed (eg. Entity.State = EntityState.Added) regardless of any internal changes to the entity!!
Is there a way to accomplish this task?
I would appreciate if you could help me with this. Thanx a lot
