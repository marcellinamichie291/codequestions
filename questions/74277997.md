# How to get cmake command line arguments from running GUI

I managed to set up my project using cmake GUI. Is there a way to find the cmake command line to produce equivalent results (so that I don't have to run GUI every time)? Something like "When you clicked generate button the following was run: cmake <my args>" - I want to be able to find <my args>
