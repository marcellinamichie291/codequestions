# How do I expand a table multi-value cell into multiple rows?

Currently I have something where I just build a new PS Object using a foreach loop on the cities column, is there any better method?
In Azure KQL I could just do | mv-expand City to achieve this
foreach ($row in $table) {
    foreach ($city in $row.City.Split(",")) {
        [PSCustomObject] @{
            Name = $table.Name
            City = $city
            Age  = $table.Age
        }
    }
}

Existing format
