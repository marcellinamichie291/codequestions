# STM32 Button Read

What is the difference between MODER's input mode and PUPDR. I saw some code parts for buttons. One code is like
GPIOB->MODER &= ~(3U << 2*4); // PB4
GPIOB->MODER |= (0U << 2*4);

and another code is,
GPIOB->MODER &= ~(3U << 2*8);  //PB8
GPIOB->PUPDR |= (2U << 2*8);

should I make MODER register as an input like first one? But second one is just clearing MODER register and making PUPDR as Pull-up.
shouldn't I making MODER as input first?
