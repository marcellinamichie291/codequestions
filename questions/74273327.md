# Script to copy all the updates on gitlab repository to azure devops repository

In the organisation, we are in the process of migration from gitlab to azure. There are some repositories which has a lot of historical commits/branches/tags that we need to mirror to azure-devops. I would need some suggestions if we could write a script to do the same? Schedule some automatism to do so? Could anyone give me some suggestions/Examples to start off?
