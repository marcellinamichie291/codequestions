# T-SQL query to display positive values (deposits) and negative values (withdraw) between accounts

SELECT
  [Trans_Id]
  ,[Transaction_Date]   
  ,[FromAccount_ID]
  ,[ToAccount_ID]
  ,[Amount]
  FROM [Transaction]

Currently all the values are positive in the Amount column. But I want to have, if the transfer is from 93 to 56 then its the amount value should be +ve and  if the transfer is from 56 to 93 then the amount value should be -ve. some thing like below.

The example I have shown is just between 2 accounts only. But there are more than 10 accounts and I want to be a bit dynamic and automatically assigns +ve and -ve values.
Can some one please help to derive the query for this requirement. Thanks
I tried adding extra column with deposit and withdraw values in it and did not work.
