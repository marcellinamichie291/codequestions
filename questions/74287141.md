# GA and GSC data blending in Data Studio (Looker Studio)

I am trying to bled 3 data sources: 1. a google sheets with a list of URLs, Google Analytics and Google Search Console. I added a calculated field in GA with formula - CONCAT("https://domain-name",Landing Page) and used it as a join dimension. When I am checking blended data with origanal, data are different.


I've tried to use other join operators
