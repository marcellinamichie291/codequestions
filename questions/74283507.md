# Linux TC traffic limit for each ip

Although I have no idea if it is possible, I have tried many times but failed.
I want to limit each ip using TC, but TC does this for all my traffic. I tried the same method on the port but the result is still the same, it just restricts all traffic. Since it is not possible to specify each IP address separately, I want to apply an identical limit to any IP address. Do you think this is impossible?
tc qdisc del dev enp1s0f0 root
tc qdisc del dev enp1s0f0 root
tc qdisc add dev enp1s0f0 root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 100mbit
tc class add dev enp1s0f0 parent 1: classid 1:1 cbq rate 3000kbit allot 1500 prio 5 bounded isolated
