# Can I reference projected fields in criterias in MongoTemplate?

So, I have two fields: first name and last name
I need to filter users by their full name, so what I did is:
query.fields().projectAs(
    StringOperators.Concat
        .valueOf("firstName")
        .concat(" ")
        .concatValueOf("lastName"), "fullName");
query.addCriteria(Criteria.where("fullName").regex(regexString, CASE_INSENSITIVE));

but when I use mongoTemplate.find() it returns 0 entites.
I need to use Query object and can't use Aggregation as it would require me to rewrite the whole filtering.
