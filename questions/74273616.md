I'm building a neural network that takes in a text prompt and returns an emoji. I've found similar things on the web but they only return a few emojis, I want to create something so specific that it can return all 4581 different ones.
I've found this dataset containing every single emoji, but I'm struggling to find a dataset suitable for training the model. This is my 3rd Neural Network, so I'm still pretty new to this stuff. It would be great if I could get a big dataset that I could use for training the model, or maybe some way to gather the data from the web.
