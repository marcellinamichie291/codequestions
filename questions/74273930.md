# Api data is not getting fetched when the application is hosted, while It works well in localhost in a react application

I have a react application that fetches data from alpha vantage API. When in localhost, the data is fetched properly and I get the data but when the application is hosted on netlify, there is no data from the API.
Below is the code for fetching the data.
  useEffect(() => {
    const getNews = () => {
      fetch(
        "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=business&apiKey=303be9184122470198a38e255a0edf62"
      )
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => setNews(data.articles))
        .catch((err) => console.log(err.message));
    };

    getNews();
  });
