# Array inside data structure RPGLE

Is it possible to have an array inside a data structure ?
 D P_IacWtlDataIPWorkList...
 D                 ds                  template qualified
  * IACWTL
 D WorkKey                             like(T_IacWtl.WORKKEY)
  * use character field for sql fetch
 D WorkTitle                           like(T_IacWtl2.WRKTITLE)
 D WorkTitleNumber...
 D                                     like(T_IacWtl.WRKTITLENO)
 D TypeOfWorkTitle...
 D                                     like(T_IacWtl.WRKTITLETY)
  * IACWTT
 D TitleTypeDescription...
 d                                     like(T_IacWtt.Descr)

  *IACWCD

 D CAECode...
 d                                     like(T_IacWcd.CAECode)
 D CAECodeDescription...
 d                                     like(T_IacWcd.Descr)
  * IACWRK
 d OriginalVersionInd...
 d                                     like(T_IacWrk.WRKORGIND)
 d StatusOfWork...
 d                                     like(T_IacWrk.WRKSTS)
 d PublisherReferences...
 d                                     likeds(WorkReference) dim(11)      

See PublisherReferences in the above DS.
Work reference DS has been defined as below:
 D WorkReference...
 D                 ds                  template qualified
 D Reference                     30

But this fails to compile in places where P_IacWtlDataIPWorkList is used.
Basically the P_IacWtlDataIPWorkList DS contains details of works and a work can have multiple publisher references. Hence, the need for an array in this case. How can this be achieved ?
