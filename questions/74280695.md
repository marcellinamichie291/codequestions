# Appending an object to local storage objects of object

I have an object of objects stored in local storage and I want to append it when user clicks a button. My local storage data structure looks like this.
ID's are auto-generated by uuid
{
  "data": {
    "light": {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "theme1",
        "colors": {
            "body": "#FFFFFF",
            "text": "#000000",
            "button": {
                "text": "#FFFFFF",
                "heading": "#000000"
            },
        },
        "font": "Ubuntu"
    },
    "dark": {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "theme2",
        "colors": {
            "body": "#000000",
            "text": "#FFFFFF",
            "button": {
                "text": "#FFFFFF",
                "background": "#000000"
            },
        },
        "font": "Tinos"
    }
  }
}

The data above is loaded from the JSON file to local storage when the project starts and I want to append new themes as the user clicks to create.
I have been trying to get this data from local storage and append the newly created theme to it without overriding it. Here is my code snippet;
const postData = {
                "id": 3,
                "name": theme3,
                "colors": {
                    "body": state.bgColor,
                    "header": state.headColor,
                    "button": {
                        "text": state.btnBgColor,
                        "background": state.btnTxtColor
                    },
                },
                "font": state.font
            }

let data = window.localStorage.getItem("all-themes")
data = data ? JSON.parse(data) : {}
const newData = {
   ...data,
   postData
}
window.localStorage.setItem('all-themes', JSON.stringify(newData))

Doing it this way doesn't append new theme to data object but instead creates another object in local storage and it doesn't persist when refreshed. What's the correct way to approach this? Thank you all
