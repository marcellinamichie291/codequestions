# Opening Python script mode on a MacBook

I have a  MacBook air and have tried opening Python in terminal but when I open it, it opens Python interactive mode. Does anyone know how to open Python script mode please.
I’ve tried typing in things such as Python or Python 3 like safari suggests but that didn’t work.
