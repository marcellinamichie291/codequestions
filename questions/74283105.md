# Replace a date with another date on a file

I'm working on a way to automate a report that sometimes has different dates that fall out of a period. For example, my report has data similar to the below that has different sets of dates. Each period consists of two weeks, I'm trying to replace all of the dates that fall out of the current period to the current period (10/15/2022 & 10/22/2022).

In this scenario, I would want 10/1/2022 to be replaced with 10/15/2022 and 10/08/2022 to be replaced with 10/22/2022. In other words, assign the first week in a prior period to the first week in the current period and the same with the second week.
Is this something that can be automated?
I'm familiar with the basics of VBA but do not know where to start.
