# I have a background image in a div on my HTML page, and I would like it to change to a different image and back to the first one every 3 seconds

i have a sections structure webpage and i have this image that i want to change to another one every x seconds, how do i do it?
This is the HTML code:
<section id="sec1" class="sec1">
  <div class="overlay">
    <div class="herotxt">
      <h1>Â¡Bienvenidos!</h1>
      <p> Deseamos que seas parte <br>
        de nuestra comunidad educativa <br>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

And This is my css where the background img comes from:
.content .sec1:nth-child(1) {
    background-image: url(sources/11-5.JPG);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    width: 100%;
}


In my local folder  sources/img i have two images which are 11-5.jpg] and 11-4.jpg.
How do i change the 11-5.jpg to 11-4.jpg and then repeat that every 3 seconds?
