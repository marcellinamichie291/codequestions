# Redux persist session storage doesn't clear data when tab is closed

I am trying to tackle a peculiar behavior of react-persist library while working together with LocalStorage and SessionStorage.
Problem: using the below setup, react persist keeps the session state persistent across tab closures and acts like a localStorage.
const sessionStoragePersistConfig = {
    key: "session_root",
    storage: storageSession,
};

const LocalStoragePersistConfig = {
    key: "root",
    storage,
};

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    abc: abcReducer,
    xyz: persistReducer(sessionStoragePersistConfig, xyzReducer),
});

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(LocalStoragePersistConfig, rootReducer);

const middleware = [thunk];
export let store = createStore(
    persistedReducer,
    applyMiddleware(...middleware)
);
export let persister = persistStore(store);

What I noticed is that, even though xyzReducer is configured to store data in sessionStorage, it still maintains its state in localStorage (along with sessionStorage) and I think when a new tab is opened by the user, localStorage state gets copied to sessionStorage on page load (my guess).
Where am I going wrong?
I can't connect to anyone from the original redux-persist team because the repo seems to be inactive since 2019!
