# store TOML data in groovy

I'd like to create a TOML file in groovy.
import groovy.toml.*

Map<String, Object> tomlData = [
  person: [ 
      firstname: 'Stefan', 
      lastname: 'Draeger', 
      age: 42, 
      birthday: new GregorianCalendar(1980, Calendar.MAY, 11, 1, 10, 45).time, 
      hobby: ["Garten", "Programmieren"] 
    ]
]

def builder = new TomlBuilder()

builder tomlData

builder.writeTo(?)

But which writer do I have to use?
Thanks
