I'm new-ish to Python and know enough to make things happen but still learning some of the core concepts.
So todays question is ... when i make a instance of something. is it a temporary thing that vanishes after its been used or does it sit in memory taking up space ?
The reason i went down this thought process is i have a timer which repeats every 2 minutes. In the method that the timer triggers it makes a instance of something, does what it needs to then in 2 minutes it repeats. So would that mean somewhere in memory i'm adding a instance beside a instance beside a instance every 2 minutes or am i over thinking it :)
I've googled for answers but due to the nature of the question i'm struggling to find someone whos asked similar
