# Google Cloud Ops Agent Mongo Integration Error - AuthenticationFailed: SCRAM authentication failed, storedKey mismatch

I'm getting this error when setting up the 3rd party integration for Mongo with Google Ops Agent:

AuthenticationFailed: SCRAM authentication failed, storedKey mismatch


Google Cloud Ops Agent Config
Mongo Integration
    mongodb:
      type: mongodb
      insecure: false
      cert_file: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
      key_file: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
      ca_file: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
      endpoint: 127.0.0.1:443
      username: user
      password: fub&r$
      collection_interval: 60s
      insecure_skip_verify: true

The Full error:
"jsonPayload": {
    "context": "conn4277",
    "severity": "I",
    "attributes": {
      "authenticationDatabase": "admin",
      "principalName": "user",
      "mechanism": "SCRAM-SHA-256",
      "client": "1.1.1.1:34542",
      "result": "AuthenticationFailed: SCRAM authentication failed, storedKey mismatch"
    },
    "id": 20249,
    "message": "Authentication failed",
    "component": "ACCESS"
 },

I'm using a config that works on other instances, and validated the user and password are working and also have permissions needed to the database.
I can't find any useful answers relating to this error, but it does seem to be fairly common outside of the Google Ops Agent. Any insight or suggestions would be appreciated.
