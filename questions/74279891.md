I need to generate a QR Code that redirects the user to his app store to download a specific program, that is, the same QR Code can redirect either to the apple or android store depending on the device that is going to be scanned, does anyone have any idea how I can do it that? I'm doing my project in .NET with Razor, that is, it can be a solution in JavaScript, C# or even in pure HTML, thanks in advance to anyone who can help me.
