# SwiftUI: How to interstellare array of enums?

I have an array of enums where each enum either contains an image or video. I would like to loop through the array and get the values inside each enum. If the enum contains an image I would like get that value and if it contains a video then get that value.

So how do I loop through an array if enums?

This is my code:
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

enum ContentSource {
    case image(UIImage)
    case video(AVPlayer)
}

var post : [ContentSource] = []
