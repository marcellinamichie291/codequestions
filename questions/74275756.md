# Include looping because of interdepency

I have 2 headers player and grid but the struct Grid needs the definition of struct Player and a function in player needs the struct Grid. I have the include guard but still it doesn't recognize when I try to compile
grid.h :
#ifndef GRID_HEADER
#define GRID_HEADER
#include "player.h"
 
enum CaseType{ 
    WALL = '#', 
    BOX = '$', 
    PLAYER = '@', 
    GOAL = '.', 
    NONE = ' ' 
};
typedef struct Grid{
    enum CaseType** game_grid; 
    int column_number; 
    int row_number; 
    int goal_number; 
    Player player; // this one needs player.h
}Grid;
 
 
Grid init_level(const char* file_path);
 
void display(Grid* g);
 
 
void setCell(Grid* a,int i ,int j, char val);
 
#endif

player.h :
#ifndef PLAYER_HEADER
#define PLAYER_HEADER
#include "grid.h"
 
typedef struct Player{
    int x; 
    int y; 
}Player;
 
enum Direction{
    Top, 
    Left, 
    Right, 
    Bottom 
};
 
 
void move_player(Grid* a, enum Direction d); // this one needs grid.h

#endif
 

I tried reading threads and answers on stackoverflow and other forums but couldn't find any answers for this.
It should work well but it loops.
