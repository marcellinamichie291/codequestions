# Jow to use str_to_date

I need to use str_to_date function in MySql and return the correct date. Below is my try and and I am getting syntax error.
 SELECT STR_TO_DATE('011122143859',%d%c%Y%l%i%S);
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '%d%c%Y%l%i%S)' at line 1.

I need to return the timestamp value as 2022-11-01 14:38:59
Can someone show me what would be the correct syntax. I followed this resource.

Update:
I found the correct syntax as below.
STR_TO_DATE('011122143859','%d%m%y%H%i%S')
