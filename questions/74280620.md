# (mongodb) How to find a subarray in two-dimensional array elements of which match a condition

There is a two-dimensional array in every document of my collection. I have a value A and arrays B and C. How can I find documents where there is a subarray that contains A along with values from B (they don't have to be present, there may be other elements apart from them) and at the same time doesn't contain any values from C.
For example, I have:
{id: 1, arr: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]}
{id: 2, arr: [[1, 7], [3, 4]]}
{id: 3, arr: [[2], [3, 4]]}
{id: 4, arr: [[1, 2, 3], [4]]}

A = 1, B = [2, 5], C = [3, 4]
I want to get:
{id: 1, arr: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]}
{id: 2, arr: [[1, 7], [3, 4]]}

I tried to use $and along with $elemMatch, but it hasn't worked out.
