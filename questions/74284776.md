# MVC ActionLink Error: Cannot convert from int to string

I'm trying to pass the value that is displayed as action link to the controller as a parameter as below. But while Execution I get the error exception saying "CS1503: Argument2:cannot convert from int to string".
@Html.ActionLink(Convert.ToInt32(@row["SerialNo"]), GetPrvsIODtls, Home, new {SerialNo = row["SerialNo"]}, null)
Can anybody help me get out of this exception.
