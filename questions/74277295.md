# Add permissions for TDE templates using ml-gradle

We are using ml-gradle version 4.1.1 to deploy the XQuery code and data to app-modules database. Now ,we are trying to update the script to deploy TDE templates to app specific Schemas database.
Project path used for templates : /src/main/ml-schemas/tde/sample.tde
And the /tde/ folder have multiple templates in it.
To deploy the templates to App specific Schemas database, I have followed the below steps .
1.Places all the templated under /src/main/ml-schemas/tde/
2.Added mlSchemasDatabaseName=app-Schemas and mlSchemaPaths=src/main/ml-schemas

To add permissions to all the templates, added permission.properties under ml-schemas directory project path

permission.properties content:
*=ml-admin,read,ml-admin,execute,ml-reader,read
The TDE templates are getting deployed properly with TDE collection but permissions are not getting added to it.
Can anyone please help me on this to add permissions to the templates?
