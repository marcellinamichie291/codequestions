# ValueError: x and y arrays must have at least 2 entries - tslearn

I'm using tslearn library to cluster time series data, but I receive an error arbitrarily. When I run my code, it sometimes works and sometimes raises the error.
ValueError: x and y arrays must have at least 2 entries
A similar question was asked here, however, no answer is provided there. I am providing a MWE.
from tslearn.metrics import dtw
from tslearn.clustering import TimeSeriesKMeans
from tslearn.utils import to_time_series_dataset
my_first_time_series = [[1, 3, 4, 2],
                        [1, 3,5, 9]]

my_second_time_series = [[1, 3, 4, 2],
                        [1, 3,5, 9],
                         [1, 3, 4, 22],
                        [11, 23,35, 59]]

my_third_time_series = [[19, 33, 46, 2],
                        [199, 34,55, 93]]

my_fourth_time_series = [[12, 32, 4, 23]]

formatted_dataset = to_time_series_dataset([my_first_time_series, my_second_time_series, my_third_time_series, my_fourth_time_series])

model = TimeSeriesKMeans(n_clusters=3, metric="dtw", max_iter=10)
model.fit_predict(formatted_dataset)

When I call model.fit_predict(formatted_dataset) consecutively, first, it works and gives me array([1, 2, 0, 1], dtype=int64). However, when I call it couple of more times, it raises the error.
