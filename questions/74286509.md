# Azure MSAL authentication - SSO with MFA

I have an an iframe, which uses MSAL authentication. it's parent also uses the same auth mechanism and once the user has logged in the parent app, I should be able to log him in the iframe with SSO. I tried doing it with loginHint but I get this error:

That's the piece of code in the iframe that receives the loginHint from the parent and trying to use it for SSO:
 window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // check the origin of the data
  if (event.origin === parentDomain) {
    const loginHint = event.data;

    // attempt SSO
    publicClient
      .ssoSilent({
        scopes: ["openid", "profile", "User.Read"],
        loginHint,
      })
      .then((res) => {
        console.log(res);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
      });
  }
});

I think it might have something to do with the fact that my organization is using MFA (Multi factor authentication), but I'm not exactly sure. Is there a way to bypass this
without canceling the MFA?
