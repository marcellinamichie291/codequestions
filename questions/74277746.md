# R - Valuerange of Network density

I am trying to calculate the density of a network with graph from the igraphdataset (rfid). The method itself should be trivial, however as the density of a network is defined as a ratio, I would expect values between 0 and 1.
However in my case, it says 11.68. What's the problem here?
edge_density(rfid, loops = FALSE)
