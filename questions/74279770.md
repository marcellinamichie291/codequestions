# How can I extracting a call to action from a sentence in Python?

I have a chatbot and when a user says "draw me a.." or any action to "draw something" for them I want my bot to then trigger a function that draws an image.
What is the best method or libraries I can use for extracting intent and matching it to the action draw?
Is there anything for this on hugging face for example?
Right now I am just using a function like this

def solve(s, t):
   s1 = s.split()
   s2 = t.split()
   if len(s1) > len(s2):
      s1,s2 = s2,s1
   while(s1):
      if(s2[0]==s1[0]):
         s2.pop(0)
         s1.pop(0)
      elif(s2[-1]==s1[-1]):
         s2.pop()
         s1.pop()
      else:
         return(False)
   return(True)


But it isn't that great.
Thanks!
I tried with basic parsing and googled around but couldn't find anything.
