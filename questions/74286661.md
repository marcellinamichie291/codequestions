# Slack `app_home_opened`, how to verify first interaction?

I'm in the process of submitting my app to the Slack App Directory, however Slack reviewers are asking me the following:

... it should also use the app_home_opened event to send a welcome message the first time any user opens this view.

There's no information regarding whether or not it's the first interaction when this event is sent as detailed on their API documentation here. They just say:

Note: app_home_opened events are sent each time a user enters into the App Home space. Verify that this is the first interaction between a user and your app before triggering your onboarding flow.

Is there something I'm missing, or am I supposed to keep records in my app for that using a database or something?
