How can I change the background of the text depending on the current value of the status?
So right now, the current status is pending which is default to yellow
example. the value change and it became complete the backgroundColor should change to green
<Typography sx={{padding:1, backgroundColor: 'yellow'}}>
       {recent.status}
</Typography>

This is what it looks like.
