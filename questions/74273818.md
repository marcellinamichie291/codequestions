# Shooting bullets in unity2D

I'm trying to shoot bullets in a 2D top-down-shooter game but they just stay rest and doesnt move
I tried to add "addforce" but they didnt move. I changed it with  "new Vector2" but that time it doesnt follow my cursor. istead of it shoots in a different same direction.I want to shoot to my cursor. and if possible I want to add a fire delay between object  and make it possible to attack repeatly while  holding mouse left button.
`
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Shooting : MonoBehaviour
{


    public Transform firePoint;
    public GameObject bulletPrefab;
    public float bulletForce = 15f;


    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1"))

            Shoot();
        
    }

    void Shoot()
    {


        GameObject bullet = Instantiate(bulletPrefab,firePoint.position, firePoint.rotation);
        Rigidbody2D rb = bullet.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
        rb.AddForce(firePoint.right* bulletForce, ForceMode2D.Impulse);
    }
}//class
