I am trying to rename files where I change the extension and remove the last 2 characters of the file name (excluding extension), is this possible with a windows command prompt?
For example:
INF_CAN1_Knees_Top_T209_1.OUT
INF_CAN1_Knees_Outside_T196_2.OUT
Should be renamed to:
INF_CAN1_Knees_Top_T209.txt
INF_CAN1_Knees_Outside_T196.txt
Changing the extension is easy:
rename *.OUT *.txt works.
I would think that rename *_?.OUT *.txt would work, but it does not, it changes the extension, but the _1 or _2 remains. This surprises me, because it seems that the * has a different 'value' in the input and output.
Is it possible to do this, and why does it not work how I tried it?
