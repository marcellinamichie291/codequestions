# Detecting address chunk within a word document

I have a word document with some paragraphs and address details within it. I used textract to extract the sentences of this document line by line into a list. What i want to do is to detect the complete address chunk as one whole sentence string. The address template is not fixed and can or cannot have all the details some times,  how can i achieve that ?
the input document looks like -
some paragraph1

Employee’s address: Mr. A John Doe
9 hackers way
a state in US
2192
Telephone: 1411567323
Telefax: - 
E-mail: someemail@gmail.com

some paragraph 2
next page
some paragraph 3

what i want the complete address chunk to be detected is -
Employee’s address: Mr. A John Doe
    9 hackers way
    a state in US
    2192
    Telephone: 1411567323
    Telefax: -
