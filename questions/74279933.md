# rm -rf / no longer works in newest macOS versions?

I'm going to experiment on removing macOS Ventura using the terminal command 'sudo rm -rf /'. But it says "rm: / cannot be removed". And this happens with --no-preserve-root key and other protected macOS folders like Applications, Library, System as well.
Because it's a VM, I boot in from ISO installation image to enter terminal in recovery mode. csrutil disable also got no result.
Did Apple make system file protection stronger than in Catalina and even Big Sur? And is there a way to run the above command inside the system?
