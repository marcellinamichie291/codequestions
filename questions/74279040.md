In a few words, what changes if I decide to use SSR to my current Angular SPA implementation. I have an angular app (14) backed up by a node API that uses JWT authorizatoin/authentication. Do I need to change the code a lot. In general there are other considerations (my app would have to change somehow). I want some simple answer, not having to go through a tutorial.
