After
heroku login

I'm trying to run in cmd:
echo "select * from public.table limit 2;" | heroku pg:psql -app "my-app::DATABASE_URL"

and get  error: "The local psql command could not be located"
The local postgres installed in : C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin
when I try to set path
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin

or
setx PATH "PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin"

I get error like this:
C:\Program : The term 'C:\Program' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:17
+ set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin
+                 ~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (C:\Program:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

How I can to run this ?
