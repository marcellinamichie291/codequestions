# Why am I getting this error TypeError: string indices must be integers?

def parse(self, response):
        result = json.loads(response.body_as_unicode())
        for r in result:
            name = r["targetCeList"]
            print(name)


I don't understand why I get this error? I would be grateful if someone would correct my code and explain it to me
