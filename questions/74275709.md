# Problem with loading image in .doc file in the LibreOffice Writer

I created a few years ago document file with notes/images etc. Some days ago I checked the file, and one of the images not loading entirely. The image is divided into content and gray color.
I saved the image from the file and checked with pngcheck and the file isn't corrupted. I tried to convert the image to another format (stupid idea), but it was the same.
I attach the image to see what is the point.
