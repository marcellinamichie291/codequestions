# Why is my PyGame application not running at all?

I have a simple Pygame program:
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

pygame.init()

win = pygame.display.set_mode((400,400))
pygame.display.set_caption("My first game")

But every time I try to run it, I get this:
pygame 2.0.0 (SDL 2.0.12, python 3.8.3)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html

And then nothing happens.
Why I can't run this program?
