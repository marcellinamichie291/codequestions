# FIresotre query entire db and limit results

I know I can query the db like this:
final invoicesDocsRef = await invoicesRef
    .orderBy('invoiceNo', descending: true)
.limit(30)
.get()
    .then((value) => value.docs.map((doc) => Invoice.fromSnapshot(doc)));

But I want it paginated cause I dont want to call 200 rows for every user, so this was my next approach:
  Future<Iterable<Invoice>> getInvoices(
      {required int limit, String? lastDocID}) async {
    final invoicesDocsRef = invoicesRef.orderBy('invoiceNo', descending: true);
    if (lastDocID == null) {
      return await invoicesDocsRef.get().then(
            (value) => value.docs.map((doc) => Invoice.fromSnapshot(doc)),
          );
    } else {
      final lastDoc = await invoicesRef.doc(lastDocID).get();
      return await invoicesDocsRef.startAfterDocument(lastDoc).get().then(
            (value) => value.docs.map((doc) => Invoice.fromSnapshot(doc)),
          );
    }
  }

How this is not ordered at all. I thought single indexs were automatic?
