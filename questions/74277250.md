What is the way to check logs for non-application 500s?
I  have actually 2 issues
one is routing logs for https://www.test.com
other is that the '/tmp/' or our dev on system currently is writing to a private system dir
e.g. /tmp/systemd-private-840c0bc8008041628bfc86e69a7bb944-httpd.service-z3oDEZ/tmp/
our old server wrote to '/tmp/' without the 'systemd-...' additions
The '/tmp' directory storing things to private directories based on service executing the request rather than the. '/tmp' root. Do anyone help me how can resolve that?
any sort of help would be apricated?
