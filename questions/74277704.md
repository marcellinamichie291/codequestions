# Simple sine calculator doesn't return the right values

The math.sine module seem to return wrong values. Where did I made a mistake ?
import math

A = float(input("Insert a number you want the sine of"))

B = math.sin(math.radians(A))
print("sin of %.2f is %.6f" % (A, B))

The result for typing 45 is 0.707 instead of 0.85
I was just getting back into python. I sincerely can't see the error.
