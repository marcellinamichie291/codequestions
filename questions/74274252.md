# Cordova ZXing on IOS not working (or is this just a permission issue?)

This is what comes up on our console:

the same works on Android and Browser (without Cordova). But on IOS no.
It looks like it might be a really silly little issue to fix. But where to even start? Note, this is talking about tesseract here too, which is because I have combined both OCR and barcode in the same video stream. But the video stream is opened by ZXing and the this.zx is
this.zx = new ZXingBrowser.BrowserMultiFormatReader();

so reset() not being there must be because something has gone terribly wrong in the initialization of this multi-format-reader.
