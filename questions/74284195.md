# AbsorbPointer doesn't absorb tap event

As far as I know, due to this question Flutter AbsorbPointer vs IgnorePointer difference , AbsorbPointer will absorb tap event and other widgets below it will not receive tap event, but when I use AbsorbPointer like this. it still pass tap event to its parent:
GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        print('123'); // This still call when I tap on red container
      },
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.green,
        width: 300,
        height: 300,
        child: Center(
          child: AbsorbPointer(
            absorbing: true,
            child: GestureDetector(
              onTap: () {
                print('567');
              },
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    )

So my question is does AbsorbPointer only work with widget same level in Stack and doesn't work with its parent?
