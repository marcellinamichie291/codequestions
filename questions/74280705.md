There are the following two elements:

navigation (div)
div with 100 paragraph (p)

I made the navigation sticky which is working fine. But at some point even the navigation (which is sticky) is anyway pushed up and gets hidden. This happens when the lowest element reaches the top.
The parent has no overflow property set. According to the DOM the navigation still has its position: sticky.
Do you know any reason or how I can debug that?
