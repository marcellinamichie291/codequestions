# Sequential numbering for each record

I have contracts and I want each contract to have its purchase orders sequenced
I just canâ€™t get it to work
What I tried to do is make a calculated field in my form using the control source
=DMax([PO],[POt],[POt].[Contract number])+1
By that I thought if I can make it read the biggest PO for that contract to add 1 to it
But I keep getting #name? Errors
