# Es counts the total amount by time period as the end time

Now I have ten indexes, from the first to the tenth. For example, there is one data on the first, two data on the second, and so on. There are 10 data on the tenth. I want to count the total data before the date of the first, one data as of the first, three data as of the second, and so on. There is 10 on the 10! Data for.
How to write in es?
{
  "query": {"match_all": {}},
  "size": 1,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_date": {
      "date_histogram": {"field": "@timestamp", "interval": "day"}
    },
    "aggs": {
        "historyCount": {
          "date_range": {
            "field": "",
            "ranges": [
              {
                "from": "now-10d/d",
                "to": "now"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
  }
}

What I want to do is to count by time period first, and then aggregate the time period as the end time, but it seems difficult..
