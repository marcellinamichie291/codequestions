I am trying to open LibreOffice Calc and then close it again using ole automation.
The problem is that although I can open the spreadsheet, when I try to close it, only the spreadsheet window closes, the soffice processes remain in the task manager, so LibreOffice wasn't properly closed.
Here is the Delphi code which I use to open a spreadsheet:
Office: Variant;
frame: Variant;
Desktop: Variant;
comp: Variant;
Doc: Variant;
args: Variant;

Office := CreateOleObject('com.sun.star.ServiceManager');
desktop := Office.CreateInstance('com.sun.star.frame.Desktop');
args := VarArrayCreate([0,1], varVariant);
Doc := desktop.loadComponentFromURL('private:factory/scalc', '_blank', 0, args);

The spreadsheet is now open and everything seems fine, now I want to close it
so I tried this, which doesn't work properly:
  Doc.Dispose;
  frame := Desktop.FindFrame('_blank', 0);
  frame.Dispose;
  Desktop.Dispose;
  Office.Dispose;

I also tried this which also doesn't work properly:
  Doc.Close(True);
  sleep(500);
  Desktop.Dispose;
  Office.Dispose;

In both cases the program window closes, but the soffice processes remain in the task manager.
This was tested with LibreOffice 6 on Windows 7.
I did find this which is supposed to work:
xModifiable = (XModifiable)xComponent;
xModifiable.setModified(false);
xCloseable = (XCloseable)xComponent;
xCloseable.close(true);

// This closes all instances, even ones you didn't create
// If you don't write this, you'll find 'soffice.bin' still lingering in taskmgr
XDesktop xDesktop = (XDesktop)xCLoader;
if(xDesktop != null)
        xDesktop.terminate();

But I can't compile that in Delphi.
