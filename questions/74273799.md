# How to add a new .ui to project in Visual Studio?

I'm using Qt 6.4 on Visual Studio 2022, I'm trying to understand how to add a new .ui to an existing project.
For example, I have a project with a mainwindow.ui, when I open it on Qt Designer and create a new .ui window from:
[Qt Designer] File -> New -> Main Window -> Create

I added some widgets to this new window and saved it to disk with the name new_window.ui.
How do I include it in my current project? I tried #include "new_window.ui" but It throws a lot of compiler syntax errors.
What I'm trying to achieve is access the widgets from new_window.ui inside of my MainWindow class:
MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) : QMainWindow(parent)
{
    ui.setupUi(this);
    // access the 'ui' from new_window.ui here
    // new_window_ui.pushButton-> ...
}

I have seen that this ui generally is a private class member, there's no problem in having the new_window.ui ui public.
What is the correct way to achieve it?
