# Desktop application development

I'm doing an HR management system as a desktop application for my senior system and I'd like it to be able to run on Windows and MacOS so what do you think is best to develop it with:
.net
Blazor and MAUI
Blazor and electron
I'm reading resources and documtations to see which is best but I'm not sure yet
