# Reducing re-renders in React - Not going as expected

I am attempting to clean up my app and reduce the amount of re-renders that occur by using the React.memo feature, however I am struggling to understand fully why my page/component is re-rendering the amount of times it is. I believe it is down to my Redux usage and the different reducer steps that hit (fire, success, error).
App.jsx (pseudocode)
console.log("App");
return <div>
    <Switch>
       ...
       <Route render={Home} />
       ...
    </Switch>
</div>

export default App;

Home.jsx
const Home = () => {
   console.log("Home");
   return (
        <div>
          <DashboardBill/>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Home;

Dashboard.jsx
const Dashboard = () => {
    console.log("Dashboard");
    return <div>
        <MyBill/>
    </div>
}

export default memo(Dashboard);

MyBill.jsx
const mapStateToProps = ({billData}) => ({
    billData
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    loadData: () => dispatch(loadBillData)
});

const MyBill = ({billData, loadData}) => {
    console.log("MyBill");
    const [manipulatedData, setManipulatedData] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
        !billData && loadData();
    }, []);

    useEffect(() => {
       billData && setManipulatedData(someUtil.manipulate(billData));
    }, [billData]);

    return <div>{manipulatedData}</div>;
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(memo(MyBill));


The dispatch event ends up in a reducer that has the usual trigger, success and error cases to set the data within the Redux store etc.
When I load the page I am getting the following logging:

There are a few more dispatch events within the main App.jsx going on, but only a couple so that could account for the extra App mentions in the logs.
Can somebody attempt to explain what is going on here and why my memo() usages aren't doing what I am expecting?

Note: I am importing memo like import React, {memo, useEffect} from 'react';

Also, how would things be affected if MyBill were to have children that themselves made Redux store changes?
