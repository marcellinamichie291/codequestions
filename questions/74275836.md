# graph-cli installs but is not getting read on MacOS

I am installing @graphprotocol/graph-cli with yarn with the command
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli

I get the success message saying:
success Installed "@graphprotocol/graph-cli@0.31.0" with binaries:
  - graph

But when I try to check its version with graph init it says:
zsh: command not found: graph
