# Clang-Tidy custom naming enforcement and scope operator for globals

Is there a way to have clang-tidy enforce custom naming schemes based on what a variable represents? I.e. stuff like “make sure all local variable names are in camelCase” is easy with clang-tidy. What about rules like “all vector quantities must be of the format nameX, nameY, nameZ rather than Xname, namex, or name_x” and “all variables that refer to density must be named like densityOtherInfoX instead of dOtherInfo, rhoOtherInfo, etc”? Is there a way to automate that or do we have to just enforce it with code reviews?
Also, is there an automatic way to require that global variables be referred to with the scope operator? I.e. a = 2 * ::globalVar rather than a = 2 * globalVar?
Any other suggestions or things to look out for when applying clang-tidy and clang-format to a new C++/CUDA codebase for the first time?
