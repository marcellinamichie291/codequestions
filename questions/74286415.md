# Firebase Emulator - Suppress "Loaded functions definitions from source"

I am running firebase functions on local emulator and with the latest version of firebase-tools, I get this message repeatedly (It impacts my ability to debug). Is there a way to suppress this message.
+  functions: Loaded functions definitions from source: v1.function1, v1.function2, v1.function3.


I am using the following npm package versions

"firebase-admin": "^11.0.0"
"firebase-functions": "^4.0.2"
"firebase-tools": "^11.16.0"
