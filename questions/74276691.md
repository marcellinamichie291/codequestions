# Scrolling ticker in HTML with date, time, and location

I would like to create a scrolling ticker in HTML, displaying the CURRENT date, time and location on the scrolling ticker.
I already have a scrolling ticker, but I don't know how to add time, date, and location to it. I know that it has something to do with geolocation, and I need some assistance with that.
the code I have is shown below


      <div class="hwrap"><div class="hmove">
        <div class="hitem"> The time is:     </div>
         <div class="hitem"> The date is:   </div>
          <div class="hitem"> The location is: </div>
      </div></div>

    .hwrap {
       overflow: hidden; /* HIDE SCROLL BAR */
        background: #eee;
      }
      .hmove { display: flex; }
      .hitem {
      flex-shrink: 0;
       width: 100%;
       box-sizing: border-box;
        padding: 10px;
         text-align: center;
            }
  
           /* (D) ANIMATION - MOVE ITEMS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT */
          /* 4 ITEMS -400%, CHANGE THIS IF YOU ADD/REMOVE ITEMS */
      @keyframes tickerh {
       0% {transform: translate3d (100%, 0, 0);}
        100% {transform: translate3d (-400%, 0, 0);}
        }
      .hmove {animation: tickerh linear 15s infinite;}
      .hmove:hover {animation-play-state: paused;}
