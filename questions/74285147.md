# mongodb find specific column and change timestamp to date

I try to query data from mongodb with spesific column, at first it returns all the value and columns i need but then when i try to change the value of the timestamp to date it shows error like this
Options must be an object, got \"_id formId title username date createdAt\"

Here is my code
 const answers = await Answer.find(
        { userId: req.params.userId },
        { $toDate: "createdAt" },
        "_id formId title username date createdAt"
      );

i wonder where did i do wrong here...
