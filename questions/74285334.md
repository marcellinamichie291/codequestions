# Is powershell stopwatch buggy as I cannot get it to accurately time executions

I have a powershell script which runs thousands of commands that are logged onto the database, what I also do is log the start time and end time onto the database, one anomaly that I have noticed is that using the stopwatch functionality in powershell is giving me inaccurate timings.
This is how I use the stopwatch in my script.
$stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::new()
#<a whole series of loops/code etc>
#when I need to log duration of a particular section
if ($stopwatch.IsRunning -eq $true) {$stopwatch.Restart()} else {$stopwatch.Start()}
#code here
invoke-sqlcmd -serverinstance x -database y -query "insert into log_table values $($stopwatch.Elapsed.Seconds) "

What is striking is that when I look at the database log doesn't the duration doesnt make sense.
In one example, according to what was logged on the table.
start_time: 2022-11-01- 06:36:41.000
end_time: 2022-11-01.000
The powershell script calculated the duration as 12 seconds, however looking at the timespan above it is clear to see that it is over 60 seconds.
Powershell version details below.

I am not sure if I am missing something here as my logging is incorrect and making troubleshooting  difficult.
