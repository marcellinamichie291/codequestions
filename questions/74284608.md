Want to create a multidimensional array from a single array such as below?
$array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Output I want:
$newArray = [
    [0] =>  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4],
    [1] =>  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4],
  ]

I tried to make it with array_map() but failed to do it.
Or is it easier simply use foreach() or for loop?
