# In a Turbo repo, how to import a local build of an external package from an internal package?

I'm working on the structure for a monorepo using Turbo repo.
If I have this:
packages/
  development/
    dev-packageA/  // This is a mock for dev that consumes packageA
  packageA/        // PackageA is external. It gets deployed
    build/

My question is:
Can I import packageA inside dev-packageA and get it from packageA/build instead of having to publish a new version of packageA every time I want to test my dev mocks?
