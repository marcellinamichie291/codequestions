# margin not working on Sass project in Media-queries

The margin don't change in media query. I have a stylesheet scss for media query only, when I want to change some margin only work the margin of my principal breakpoint.
In my breakpoint 768 I want change the margin but doesn`t work, only work background-color
.item__p {
  margin: 2rem;
}
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px)
.item__p {
  background-color: aqua;
  **margin: 10rem;**
}
