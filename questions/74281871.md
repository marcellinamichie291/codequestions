# MEF does not load all expected components

I have a core MEF implementation that gives me a bad headache...
In each of three separate assemblies I created an IService implementation.
All three classes looks similar like this:
[Export(typeof(IService))]
public class ClassX : IService {}


Now I have an implementaton that tries loading all three of them.
The loader assembly is in the same folder as all three service implementations
The code that loads the 3 parts looks like:
public class ClassLoader
{

   [ImportMany(typeof(IService))]
   public IEnumerable<IService> Services { get; set; }

   public async Task<bool> LoadAsync(CancellationTokenSource cts, string path)
   {
      var assemblies = Directory.GetFiles(path, "*.dll", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly)
                                .Select(AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath)
                                .Where(s => s.GetTypes().Where(p => typeof(IService).IsAssignableFrom(p)).Any())
                                .Select(a => new AssemblyCatalog(a)).ToList();
            
      var catalog = new AggregateCatalog();
      assemblies.ForEach(a => catalog.Catalogs.Add(a));

      var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog, CompositionOptions.DisableSilentRejection);
      container.ComposeParts(this);

      ....
   }
}

This code only loads 2 of three assemblies.
My question is, any suggestions why on of them is not loaded?
But maybe more helpfull are their ways to find out why a particular type is not loaded. I hoped that the compositionoption gave me an error, but I didn't in this case.
What are the best debugging possibilities?
Thanks already for sharing any ideas.
