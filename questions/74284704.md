# SyntaxError: The keyword 'package' is reserved @rollup/plugin-commonjs

I am trying to build my code but keep getting this error
3: const axios = require('axios');
4: const package = require('../../package.json');
         ^
5:
6: const spec = morx.spec()
SyntaxError: The keyword 'package' is reserved (4:6) in C:\Users\computer name\Desktop\name\name\name\node_modules\flutterwave-node-v3\services\beneficiaries\rave.create.js

its nothing to do with the code. here is my rollup config file
const resolve = require("@rollup/plugin-node-resolve")
const commonjs = require("@rollup/plugin-commonjs")
const json = require("@rollup/plugin-json")
const builtins = require("builtin-modules")

module.exports = {
  input: "autotasks/relay/index.js",
  output: {
    file: "build/relay/index.js",
    format: "cjs",
    exports: "auto",
  },
  plugins: [
    resolve({ preferBuiltins: true }),
    commonjs(),
    json({ compact: true }),
  ],
  external: [
    ...builtins,
    "ethers",
    "web3",
    "axios",
    /^defender-relay-client(\/.*)?$/,
  ],
} 

failed to get any meaningful solutions from the GitHub issues and the package repo has been archived. any help would be appreciated.
