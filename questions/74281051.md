# quick question about JSON new line to javascript

Basically I have a JSON file and whenever I take it to my js application and print it to the console it never print a new line I have no Idea why
my JSON file:
[
  {
    "id": "71046",
    "question": "What is a cpu?",
    "answer": "Brain of the computer,  it has all the circuity needed to proccess input, store data  and output results.",
    "options": [""]
  },
  {
    "id": "63888",
    "question": "What can the proccessor perform?",
    "answer": "1) Basic arithmetic 2) Logic Control 3) Input/Output",
    "options": []
  },
  {
    "id": "5418",
    "question": "CPU principle components:",
    "answer": "1) ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)\n 2) Processor Register\\n 3) Control Unit",
    "options": []
  }
]

I tried many solution to parse print and others and didn't work which is weird
I went through this link in stackoverflow and didn't find solution: How do I handle newlines in JSON?
