# sending messages using ADB end up sending "s16" to every receiver

I'm trying to send many messages to many people. But when I try , with many receivers its end up by sending "s16" to everybody.
when I tried it with only 2 receivers, its works perfectly.
I'm working on python and with a smartphone on android 9
I made a program on python which use this command:
`
adb -s d7716a63 shell service call isms 7 i32 0 s16 "com.android.mms.service" s16 "{recepteur}" s16 "null" s16 "{message}" s16 "null" s16 "null"

`
