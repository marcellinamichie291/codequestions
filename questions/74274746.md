# [google play console]Your app is not compliant with how REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission[Flutter

I using Flutter.
My application is simple.
There are no features that require users to install within the app.
Google says the following

We found that your app is not compliant with how
REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission is allowed to be used.
Specifically, the use of the permission is not directly related to the
core purpose of the app.
The REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission allows an application to
request the installation of app packages.​​ To use this permission,
your app’s core functionality must include:
Sending or receiving app packages, and Enabling user-initiated
installation of app packages.


I did tring
added AndroidManifest

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES" tools:node="remove" />
