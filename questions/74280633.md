# Laravel HTTP Rate Limit event / log

I'm using the Laravel middleware rate limiter to limit HTTP requests to a particular route.  I need some way of generating a log message or alert when that limit is exceeded.  I have not been able to find an event that Laravel emits or an easy way to hook a call to my code into that process.
Is there a conventional way to do this that someone could tell me?
