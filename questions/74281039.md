# Flutter-equivalent of CSS max-content and min-content

Sometimes, after wrapping a list of widgets inside a Column or a ListView, the widget takes the whole width or height of this column. However, I simply wish it took the height or width of its contents, but so far I've only been able to find either very complicated ways of doing this or ways of giving, for example, buttons and texts fixed width or height.
In CSS, there's min-content and max-content for doing this sort of stuff. Is there an equivalent in Flutter?
