# BlueJ wonâ€™t show details of error when compiling

I'm trying to write code that will decrement the boiling point of water based on the altitude from sea level. I was getting errors in the for loop due to lack of initialisation and incompatible values but that has been solved. Despite this, I still receive an error message when compiling except it gives me no info on what or where the issue is.
import java.util.Scanner; 
public class WaterState {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int WaterBoil = 100;
        int Temp = 0;
        int Alt = 0;
        int AltRise = 300;
        int WaterFreeze = 0;
        System.out.println("What is the temperature(degrees Celsius)?");
        String TempStr = scan.nextLine();
        Temp = Integer.parseInt(TempStr);
        System.out.println("What is the altitude(metres above sea level)?");
        String AltStr = scan.nextLine();
        Alt = Integer.parseInt(AltStr);
        
        for(Alt = Alt - AltRise;Alt > 0; WaterBoil = WaterBoil - 1) {
        System.out.printlnp("Water boiling point is ", +WaterBoil);
    }
