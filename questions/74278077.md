# Switch Azure Function App from Dedicated App Service Plan to Premium

I am just wondering if there is a path to migrate a Function App that is hosted on a Dedicated App Service Plan to a Premium Plan?
I have tried using the Azure CLI to change the underlying App Service Plan but am getting this message: Your functionapp is not using a Consumption or an Elastic Premium plan. Currently the switch is only allowed between a Consumption or an Elastic Premium plan.
Is there any other way other than completely recreating the Function App to do this?
