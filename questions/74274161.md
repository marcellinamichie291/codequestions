I'm engaged in developing a SaaS where users can create tickets (like for a party or whatever they need tickets) and I'm stuck in the let create part. Once the user is registred, it should appear a "creator" (form) where they submit all the info (the place, the price...). That's easy, but the problem is that I don't know how to make it appear in the "marketplace section".
The main idea is that the user creates the event (trough that form) and automatically the SaaS creates a landing page where users can see the info and pay (stripe emblebed). Anyone knows how could be that done?
Thank you, folks!
I already tried to catch the event info with a form and take it to my Database. But I really have no idea how to make that automation that crates a landing page where the client can see all the details.
