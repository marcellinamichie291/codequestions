# How to pass a user input as column name in the output table of a function in R

I am trying to write a function in r. I have a data set that has month as col name. Each col consists of a set of number against a name. I wanted select one month and then multiply that column with ten and store it in a new column which is renamed with the month name e.g. Total_ (name of the month). Thank you
Name <- c("A"   ,"B"  ,"C"   ," D"  ,"E"  ,"F") 
Aug <-  c("12"   ,"12"  ,"2"   ," 5"  ,"12"  ,"12") 
Sep <- c("15"   ,"12"  ,"2"   ," 6"  ," 5"  ,"11" ) 
Oct <- c("8"   ,"12"  ,"2"   ," 5"  ," 5"  ," 6" )
June <- c("6"   ,"12"  ,"2"   ,"12"  ,"12"  ,"12")
 
data <- data.frame(Name,Aug,Sep,Oct,June)
my.function <- function(df,month) {
  name2 <- "aug"
  data <- data %>% select(1:1, contains(name2))
  d <- as.data.frame(data)
  d[is.na(d)] <- 0
  d[d==""] <- 0
  x <- paste0('sale_Total',name) # want to create a col name "Sale_Total_Month_selected" 
  d$(x) <- d$(name2)*10# this is not working :P
}
