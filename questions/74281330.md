# Reverse deque in C++

I need to implement deque using linked list, so solution for reverse was kinda similar to reversing list. In the code below you can see several functions just to better understand logic of my deque implementation. But the problem is: nothing is shown, when calling function reverse().
Where the problem can be?
Code implementation:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node
{
    int mData;
    Node* pPrev, *pNext;
    Node()
    {
        this->mData = mData;
        pPrev = pNext = NULL;
    }
    Node(int value)
    {
        mData = value;
        pPrev = pNext = NULL;
    }
};
class Deque
{
private:
    Node *pFront, *pRear;
    int mSize;
public:
    Deque()
    {
        pFront = pRear = NULL;
        mSize = 0;
    }
    void pushFront(int data)
    {
        Node* newNode = new Node(data);
        if (newNode == NULL)
        {
            cout << "Error";
        }
        else
        {
            if (pFront == NULL)
            {
                pRear = pFront = newNode;
            }
            else
            {
                newNode->pNext = pFront;
                pFront->pPrev = newNode;
                pFront = newNode;
            }
            mSize++;
        }
    }

    void reverse()
    {
        if (pFront == NULL &&  pRear == NULL)
        {
            cout << "Queue is empty!";
        }
        else 
        {
            Node* prev, * cur, * succ;
            cur = prev = pFront;
            cur = cur->pNext;
            prev->pNext = NULL;

            while (cur != NULL) {
                succ = cur->pNext;
                cur->pNext = prev;
                prev = cur;
                cur = succ;
            }
            pFront = prev;
        }
    }
