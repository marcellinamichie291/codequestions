# Loop through array of objects and assign parent object to each child array of object using javascript

I have a array of object as follows. Currently there is only one object but invocations has an array of objects. Depending on how many array of objects we have for invocations, we want to update the main array of objects. For e.g. if there are 2 objects in invocations, i want to separate those 2 invocations and replicate their parent object for both invocations.
This is not a regular iteration of array of objects and thats why i am not able to get the desired result. Any help is appreciated
const input = [
    {
        "name": "Test Data",
        "invocations": [
            { "invocationId": "123" },
            { "invocationId": "125" },
        ]
    },
]

const output = [
    {
        "name": "Test Data",
        "invocations": [
            { "invocationId": "123" },
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Test Data",
        "invocations": [
            { "invocationId": "125" },
        ]
    }
]
