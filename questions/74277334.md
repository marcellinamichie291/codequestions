# Process kill in whm

If I execute a process kill in through whm, how do i get back those killed processes. Can the killed processes be brought back and what are the effects of the kill on my websites.
Thanks
I have killed one or two processes. My server load is too high thus leading to server shut downs. My webhost suggested i kill some of the running processes creating the high server load
