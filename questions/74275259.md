# Vulkan SDK installer: what are "Debuggable Shader API Libraries" for?

I was installing a new Vulkan SDK.
I'm not sure what this "Debuggable Shader API Libraries" do. The description is very short so I don't understand if I should mark it or not.
Can you help me understand the use case of this component?
