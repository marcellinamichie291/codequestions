# Azure ADF - Mapping based on Sink Table Data

I have got two Azure SQL tables, one in source and one in Sink, now based on the ID a single row in Source will match two rows in the target table but I need to update different columns in target based on which row it is, try to explain with an example.
Target Table
ID      Leg        Col1       Col2
so for the above, if Leg = 1, I want to map Col1 and if Leg = 2, I want to map Col2, so basically checking some data in Sink table before doing the mapping, can that be done using Azure Data Factory data flow? If yes, how?
Thank you
