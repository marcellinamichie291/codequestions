# Deploy angular and core web api in single solution to single azure web app

How can we deploy both angular and api projects(6.0) in single solution to single azure web app? In Visual studio 2022, we have stand alone angular template option to create an angular project. If I am adding a .net 6 api also to this same solution, how can we deploy both in single web app?
