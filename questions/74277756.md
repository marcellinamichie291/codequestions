# Python Executable not Running in Terminal

I created a python script in VS Code that runs perfectly fine.
I am trying to turn it into an executable for ease of access and use.
I have a macbook air m1 and everything should be up to date.
I installed pyinstaller with pip install pyinstaller.
When I run pyinstall #filename I get everything to run fine including the python executable inside the folder.
I have also tried pyinstaller --windowed #filename and it works fine as well according to the stuff that pops up.
When I run the executable my terminal opens for half a second and spews something and then it dissapears. When I check my taskbar I see terminal still open so I click on it. it shows just a blank terminal and I cannot scroll up to see what was running before hand.
I am not sure what I am doing wrong that is causing the exe to not run but when I run python3 #filename in the terminal everything runs fine.
Any help would be appreciated
I have tried not a whole lot because I am not sure what the error really is
I expect that when I run the python exe that was created I will get the terminal opening up and the first lines of my code asking for user input will run.
instead I get the terminal opening up and getting some gibberish I do not have time to read and then the terminal blanks out and I cannot see what it did.
