# Mutate multiple pandas dataframe inplace using a function

I would like to write a function that takes multiple dataframes that have the same structure, does specific transformations and saves the transformations inplace.
Dummy dataframes
df = pd.DataFrame({"Full name" : ["John Doe","Deep Smith","Julia Carter","Kate Newton","Sandy Thompson"], 
                     "Monthly Sales" : [25,30,35,40,45]}) 

df2 = pd.DataFrame({"Full name" : ["Alicia Williams","Kriten John","Jessica Adams","Isaac Newton","Whitney Gordon"], 
                     "Monthly Sales" : [35,20,50,15,40]})

Transformative function
I don't want to return the dataframe, but rather save those transformations in place.
def tidy_dfs(dfs):
    for df in dfs:
        # Drop first row
        df = df.iloc[1: , :]
        # Replace spaces in columns
        df.columns = [c.replace(' ', '_') for c in df]
        # change cols to lower
        df.columns = [c.lower() for c in df]
    return df

saving df,df2 = tidy_dfs([df,df2]) of course won't work as we're outside the loop.
Results
What would be a way to call this function and save the transformation inplace?
tidy_dfs([df,df2])
