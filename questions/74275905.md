# How to use syminfo.basecurrency and syminfo.root to decrease the number of tickers?

I use symbol variables with prefix "BINANCE" for security calls and I use other variables without prefix "BINANCE" and without "USDT" for symbol display.
`// Tickers
ticker1  = "BINANCE:BTCUSDT"
ticker2  = "BINANCE:ETHUSDT"
ticker3  = "BINANCE:BCHUSDT"
ticker4  = "BINANCE:XRPUSDT"
ticker5  = "BINANCE:EOSUSDT"
ticker6  = "BINANCE:LTCUSDT"
ticker7  = "BINANCE:TRXUSDT"
ticker8  = "BINANCE:ETCUSDT"
ticker9  = "BINANCE:LINKUSDT"
ticker10 = "BINANCE:XLMUSDT"
ticker11 = "BINANCE:XMRUSDT"
ticker12 = "BINANCE:DASHUSDT"
ticker13 = "BINANCE:ZECUSDT"

// Labels
label1  = "BTC"
label2  = "ETH"
label3  = "BCH"
label4  = "XRP"
label5  = "EOS"
label6  = "LTC"
label7  = "TRX"
label8  = "ETC"
label9  = "LINK"
label10 = "XLM"
label11 = "XMR"
label12 = "DASH"
label13 = "ZEC"`

But by doing this I exceed the limit allowed by Tradingview.
So I want to put the same variables (ticker1 ticker2 ticker3 ect) in the labels but without the prefix "BINANCE" and "USDT".
I tried with syminfo.basecurrency and syminfo.currency and syminfo.root but I didn't succeed because I don't know how to use them in my case.
Do you have any idea how to do this ?
