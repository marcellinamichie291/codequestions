# How do you initialize an empty array in scala and update the values by index?

I'm new to Scala and I'm trying to create and array of strings like this
array[2][2] 

and fill it with spaces
such as
array[2][2] = [["",""],["", ""]]

then go back in there and fill them as such:
array[0][1] = "Apple"
array[1][0] = "Carrot"

This seems so much easier to do in Python and C++ compared to Scala. Any suggestion and good practiced methods will be kindly appreciated.
