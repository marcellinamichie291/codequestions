# Force responsive resizing on fixed sized object (ngl molecule viewer)

this is my first thread, please be tolerant with my description.
I am looking for a way to enforce a responsive sizing on the ngl molecule viewer from dashbio.
documentation: https://dash.plotly.com/dash-bio/nglmoleculeviewer
It only has the properties height and width in pixels, but I want to resize it according to the browser. Just like other html objects.
repositories used: dash_bootstrap_components, html from dash
Tried putting it in an html wrapper (html.A), but that didn't work.
code to that:
html.A(
    dashbio.NglMoleculeViewer(
        id="ngl_molecule_viewer",
    ),
    style={
        "width": "100%",
        "height": "100%",
    },
),

I am totally new to css or html and really came to my limitations regarding this problem and hope there is a neat trick I don't know to enforce sizing on fix sized objects.
Thanks in advance.
