# How to keep a button visible when clicking on other buttons?

I'm creating a tic tac toe game, and I have created 2 buttons "Quit" and "Replay". When I click on any other buttons, those 2 buttons disappear. I'd be happy if you tell what I can do to have them visible when I click on any other buttons.
As you can see in both screenshots, before I click on any buttons, both are visible, but when I click on any button, both disappear, and I have to hover my mouse over them for them appear again.


Below is my code in the constructor of the class for the 2 buttons that I created.
TickTacToe(){
    
    JButton Replay,Quit;
    Replay = new JButton();
    
    Replay.setText("Replay?");
    Replay.setForeground(Color.black);
    Replay.setFont(new Font("Courgette",Font.BOLD,17));
    Replay.setBackground(new Color(51,204,255));
    Replay.setBounds(70,10, 100,45);
    Replay.setFocusable(false);
    
    
    
    Quit = new JButton();
    
    Quit.setText("Quit!");
    Quit.setForeground(Color.black);
    Quit.setFont(new Font("Courgette",Font.BOLD,19));
    Quit.setBackground(new Color(255,204,61));
    Quit.setBounds(620, 10, 100, 45);
        Quit.setFocusable(false);

}
