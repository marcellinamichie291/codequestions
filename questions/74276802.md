# Azure Deployment From VS Your web app is running and waiting for your content

I have and ASP.net MVC Web API 2.0 Project (.net framework 4.8), I am publishing the project from Visual studio 2022 into my Azure App Service and it shows me that deployment succeeded, but when i open site i get this
Your web app is running and waiting for your content
Your web app is live, but we don’t have your content yet. If you’ve already deployed, it could take up to 5 minutes for your content to show up, so come back soon.
Do i have to wait long? or did i make any mistakes because i think i am doing this right specially that i already deployed another project but it was ASP.net Core.
Thanks in advance
