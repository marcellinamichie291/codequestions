I am watching a video on creating your own sin function in python. However, the youtuber doesn't really explain what each line of code does, and his function returns the value in radians - i need mine in degrees.
Note in the broader picture i am trying to use this sin function to prove pi so i cannot use math.pi in the code anywhere. This is the function used in his video.
import math

def my_sin(theta):
    theta = math.fmod(theta + math.pi, 2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    result = 0
    termsign = 1
    power = 1

    for i in range(10):
        result += (math.pow(theta, power) / math.factorial(power)) * termsign
        termsign *= -1
        power += 2
    return result

I don't understand why he uses the line:
theta = math.fmod(theta + math.pi, 2 * math.pi) - math.pi

If you really need further context here is the video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2fKxw9EPmU.
So could anyone explain what that line is used for and how i can output the answer in degrees  rather than radians without pi.
