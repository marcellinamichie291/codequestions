# How to make the length of a nested list equal to the value of a number in a list, using list comprehension?

I'm really new to Python, so forgive me if this is a ridiculously simple question.
I have a given list
x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Now I want to make a list e, using list comprehension, that contains a list for each odd element of list x. All inner elements of this list should be true and the number of list elements is given by the current number of x. So it should look like this:
[[], [True, True], [True, True, True, True], ...]

The code I have so far is:
e = [[True for z in x] for z in x if z % 2 != 0]

When printed I get a list, where the amount of nested lists is equal to the amount of odd numbers in list x, but all of them contain True ten times. What do I have to do to make the lengths of the inner lists equal to the values of the odd numbers?
