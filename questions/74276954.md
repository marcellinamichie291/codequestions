# Accessing the script of package.json of a npm package from our project package.json file

I created a tool and registered it on npmjs.com named Yattex. It script looks something like this
`
"scripts": {
    "clean:reports": "rm -R -f cypress/reports && mkdir cypress/reports && mkdir cypress/reports/mochareports ",
    "pretest": "npm run clean:reports",
    "scripts": "cypress run",
    "combine-reports": "mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/mocha/*.json > cypress/reports/mochareports/report.json",
    "generate-report": "marge cypress/reports/mochareports/report.json -f report -o cypress/reports/mochareports -- inline",
    "posttest": "npm run combine-reports && npm run generate-report",
    "yattex-tool": "node yattex-tool",
    "decorator": "node yattex-tool/test-decorators",
    "test": "npm run decorator && npm run scripts || npm run posttest || npm run yattex-tool"
  },

`
Now, in another project i installed the package and now i dont know what to write in scrips(test) to run the above test command which is in the node_modules/yattex/package.json file
I tried yattex and node node_modules/yattex/package.json
But it doesn't work. I'm a newbie and i cant find any solution...
