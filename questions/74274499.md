# How to select a column from different table in Mysql

Hi I have two tables that are arduino_id and tb_device. I want to select all the column from arduino_id and one column on tb_device. How do I do that?
table: arduino_id
table: device
I've tried this query but it doesn't work:
SELECT a.id_node, a.name_node, a.volt, a.temp_udara, a.humid, a.arus, a.luminance, a.coord, a.kwh, a.bck, a.date_server FROM arduino_id a JOIN tb_device d ON a.name_node = d.nama_device
