# Randomize items in a UL, locally the code is working but when I deploy to server I'm getting an error

Quick JS DOM question.
Im trying to randomize items in a UL and locally the code is working but when I deploy to server and load the page im getting the error .children is reading as null.
Here's my code:
let ul = document.querySelector('#slider');
for (var i = ul.children.length; i >= 0; i--) {
        ul.appendChild(ul.children[Math.random() * i | 0])};

Not sure what I can try to fix this.
Exact error:
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'children') at landingPage.js:1107:17"
