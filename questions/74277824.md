So I've been trying to fetch some daily data with SYSDATE on a date type YYYYMMDD as following:
SELECT dates, trunc(calendar_date, 'DD') calendar_dates, weekday_nbr
FROM db.date
WHERE dates BETWEEN to_char(TRUNC(SYSDATE)-2, 'YYYYMMDD') AND to_char(TRUNC(SYSDATE)-1, 'YYYYMMDD')

But now I'm trying to use the same but on a YYYY+MM+Week date type with not much success
I tried using:
SELECT T time, period, fiscal_week
FROM db.time
WHERE time BETWEEN to_char(TRUNC(SYSDATE)-2, 'W') AND to_char(TRUNC(SYSDATE)-1,'W')

Knowing that there's no way I can truncate such date type, how can TRUNC SYSDATE YYYY+MM+Week to get the data on the last 2 weeks?
Also I was thinking about maybe getting the totals from a set day and then dropping all but the last 2 weeks, but on the long run maybe that would be time consuming.
