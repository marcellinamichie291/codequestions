# C program to get user input and validate from .dat FILES

i have a university assignment which required to build a C language program which made for login/registration system . The login section of the system would required to validate if the username is already registered in the dat file or not. I have found some examples in Youtube/Github/Stack overflow sites however most of them uses "struct" however my syllabus does not mention any about struct . I would like to know if its possible to create a login system without using struct ? If yes , how would be the syntax that can be use to check user input from keyboard with username in dat.file ? I have use VS code for this code. Kindly help to advice if possible :(
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main() {

    FILE*fptr;
    char username[20];
    char username1[20];
    char password[15];
    char password1[15];
    char name[20];
    char address[30];
    char pnum[12];
    int opt;

    fptr = fopen("customer.dat","a+");

    if(fptr == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error! The file does not exist.");
        exit(0);
    }

    printf("Kindly choose your action ? \n");
    printf("Please key in as 1 for login and 2 for registration :\t");
    scanf("%d" , &opt);

    system("CLS");
    
    if (opt == 1)
    {
    
    printf("Welcome to login page\n\n");

    printf("\nInsert username ? : ");
    scanf("%s", &username);

    printf("\nInsert password ? : ");
    scanf("%s", &password);

    printf("Login success");
         
    }

    else if (opt == 2)
    {
    printf("\nWelcome to Registration page ! \n");

    printf("\nPlease enter the username : ");
    scanf("%s",&username);
    fprintf(fptr, "Username = %s\t\t", username);

    printf("\nPlease enter the password : ");
    scanf("%s",&password);
    fprintf(fptr, "Password = %s\t\t", password);

    printf("\nPlease enter your name : ");
    scanf("%s",&name);
    fprintf(fptr, "Name = %s\t\t", name);

    printf("\nPlease enter your address : ");
    scanf(" %[^\n]s", address);    // The [] is the scanset character. [^\n] tells that while the input is not a newline ('\n') take input.              
    fprintf(fptr, "Address = %s\t\t", address);
    
    printf("\nPlease enter your phone number : ");
    scanf("%d",&pnum);
    fprintf(fptr, "Phone Num = %d\t\t", pnum);
    printf("\n");

    fprintf(fptr, "********************************************* \n\n");

    printf("\nThank you. Your information is now saved to our database !\n");
    printf("You may now login to the website using to your username >>  %s  <<\n\n\n", username);
    printf("Registration process will exit now ! ");

    fclose(fptr);
    }

    else {

        printf("Key in correct number either 1 or 2 . Program will exit now");

         }

return 0;
