# How to get a typed object with angularfire 7+ (firebase 9)

I recently started to use the "new" modular approach of angular and angularfire.
I'm trying to retrieve a document from a collection.
Currently I've this:
  constructor(private firestore: Firestore, private auth: Auth) {
    const userId = this.auth.currentUser?.uid;
    const docReference = doc(this.firestore, 'queues/' + userId);
    this.myQueue$ = docData(docReference);
  }

My goal is to have myQueue$ typed like this:
  public readonly myQueue$: Observable<Queue | null>;

But I'm not really sure how?
I tried to do the following:
const docReference = doc<Queue>(this.firestore, 'queues/' + userId);
this.myQueue$ = docData<Queue>(docReference);

but it doesn't work because this.firestore isn't a CollectionReference<Queue>(which seems normal since its the whole firestore database).
This modular is a bit a pain, most of the doc still refer to the "old" approach: https://github.com/angular/angularfire/tree/master/docs/firestore.
So how can I work with typed objects?
