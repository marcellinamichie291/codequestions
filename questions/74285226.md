# Want to use swaggerCodeGen or OpenApi clients to create Java Clients for thirdparty Rest APIs from bill.com or quickbooks. How to?

Trying to figure how to use Codegens like Swagger or OpenAPI to quickly generate client code for Bill.com, Quickbooks or other third party APIs which I wish to conume to create my app.  Most help with creating API first wherein I host the API and publish the client code as well.  But how do I generate clients for 3rd party APIs
Wish to have tools that help me generate a YAML or utilities that can give YAML from the URIs I wish to consume.  Then create the COdeGen to create the entire documentation and API testing or integration client stub.
