# PUT or PUSH for modifying the existing data?

I have viewset,
class CompanyViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = s.CompanySerializer   
    queryset = m.Company.objects.all()

Which shows the view on /api/companys
There is a button for POST

I can add the new data from this form.
Now I want to modify the existing data.
I have basic questions.

PUSH can modify the data? or PUT should be implemented?

How PUT can be implemented for ModelViewSet?
