# How do I edit each chart title?

I am trying to get the title for the first two scatter charts to show without being cut off.
Male_median_income <- final_dataset%>% 
  filter(Sex == "Male")

Female_median_income <- final_dataset%>% 
  filter(Sex == "Female")

ggplot(Male_median_income, aes(x = Male_median_income$sum_of_median_income, y = Female_median_income$sum_of_median_income)) + geom_point()  + stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq() + facet_wrap(~Male_median_income$`Education qualification`)
