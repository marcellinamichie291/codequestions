# How to create a formula that depends on the value of another formula - R


H2 = 0

H3 - H999 = =SQRT(EXP(0,05)*ABS($I2-50))*NORMINV(RAND();0;1)

I2 - I999 = =$E$2+$D$2*EXP($A$2*($G2-$B$2)+$C$2)/(1+EXP($A$2*($G2-$B$2)+$C$2))+H2

Hi guys,
i created the formula obove in excel.
I want to implement this one to R. Can anyone help me with this?
I already tried to do it with formula and with data.frame.
The probelm is that sigma depends on t and X(t)-1.
Can anyone help me with it?
Thanks,
Max
