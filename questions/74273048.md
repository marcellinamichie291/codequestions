# Convert gif or mp4 to animated Webp with flutter or another way

Does anyone know how to create animated WebP, from a gif or mp4?
I already tried with flutter_image_compress and with the image library and although I convert the gif to Uint8List, when I show it in the ui it doesn't move, and much less I can convert it to animated WebP.
