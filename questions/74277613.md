# Remove space from paste() above array in R

I have the following code snippet in R,
paste("V",as.character(c(1:6)))

which generate the following output for the array:
"V 1" "V 2" "V 3" "V 4" "V 5" "V 6"
The generated spaces in the array elements are unnecessary.
How can I remove the spaces in a short (one line) code?
