# Terraform additional security group for managed nodes in EKS

I am trying to add an additional security group to the existing managed nodes in EKS module: https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks
if I add:
      vpc_security_group_ids  = [aws_security_group.additional.id]

to: eks_managed_node_group_defaults
Then Terraform wants to create new launch template and remove existing SG from it.
