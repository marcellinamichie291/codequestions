# PyQt5 - How to make a push button always has true value when click down and false value when it has up

Im just try to use PyQt5 for my robot GUI. im little bit confuse how to use momentary push button which should giving true value when it pressed down and false value when it unpressed. fyi im using python for this.
im already try to use "setCheckable" to detecting its state, but it make the button toggled (not momentary). is there any other methode that i can implement?
