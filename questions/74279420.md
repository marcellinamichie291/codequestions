# How to make a function on a web page, that edits strings in text files?

With Blazor I've made a Blazor Server App, where there is a page that can upload txt files.
The files are then stored in the \wwwroot directory.
Now i'm trying to find out how to get some edit function on the page,
so the strings can be edited from there.
Here is some code that shows I want every 3 in my txt file replaced.
@code
{
    public void editFile()
    {
        File.WriteAllText(@"\wwwroot\DEJLIGER.txt", Regex.Replace(File.ReadAllText(@"\wwwroot\DEJLIGER.txt"), "3", "replacementString"));
    
    }
}

I'm just not sure how I can get the an edit function on the page that can replace the strings in a file.
