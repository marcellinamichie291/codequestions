# Azure Web App Support for .NET Framework 4.8.1 | Getting build error in cloud, because target is v4.8.1

The .NET Framework version 4.8.1 was released in August of this year.  When will it be supported in Azure Web Apps?
I upgraded a solution with multiple projects targeting v4.8.1.  Building on my local machine is fine - no errors; however, when I attempted a build via a pipeline in ADO, I get the error:
##[error]C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1217,5): Error MSB3644: The reference assemblies for .NETFramework,Version=v4.8.1 were not found. To resolve this, install the Developer Pack (SDK/Targeting Pack) for this framework version or retarget your application. You can download .NET Framework Developer Packs at https://aka.ms/msbuild/developerpacks
Perhaps it's a setting I'm overlooking?
