# Mastermind - Separating the white from black results, using "sum of minima"

This is as far as I can for the question below, but it is not correct. Any advice appreciated.
For the number b labeled white answers we can say:
If the color i appears ni times in S, and mi times in P, while they are common min(ni,mi) times in the two codes.
Calculate the "sum of these minima". Because this sum includes the correctly placed colors, you need to remove the white results from the black results using the formula below :
b = âˆ‘(from i=1 to nbcolors) min(ni,mi) - n
where n is the number of the black results. Write the function that returns the number of white answers.
n is number of black results / b is number of white results /
mi is number of times where color i appears in S / mi is number of times where color i appears in P / P is proposed answer / S is secret code / white is correct color/wrong position / black is correct color/correct position

def nbwhite(S,P,n):
    b=0
    ni=0
    mi=0
    if len(S)==len(P):
        for i in range (len(S)):
            if P[i] in S:
                n+=1
            if S[i] in P:
                mi+=1
        for i in range (1,6):
            b=min(ni,mi)-n
        return b
