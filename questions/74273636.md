# Which is better between big range scan with coprocessor vs. multi range scans

For example here is an HBase table storing people's info, and each row represents a person, and here are two possible row key schema and columns to consider:

Plan A: City+Career+PersonID and not column

Plan B: City+PersonID and a column named Career


Now I want to query people that city locates at Asia and career is interested,
If the count of city locates at Asia is N and the count of careers we interested is M, so:

In Plan A, I will have N * M ranges to can.
In Plan B, I will have N ranges to scan, each of the ranges may be big, but I can use a coprocessor to do filter.

When M is small, Plan B has to scan a lot of ranges, but when M is large, Plan A has to create a lot of scans.
How to determine which plan to use?
