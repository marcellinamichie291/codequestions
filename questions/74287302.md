# How to get result of custom query with new field name in spring boot

In my springboot application I have repository connected to the mysql. I can make query which has same response fields as the entity. But in case of native query how can I catch the new fields?
Here is my query method
@Repository
public interface LogRepository extends JpaRepository<Log, String>  {

    @Query("SELECT error, COUNT(*) AS numberOfErr FROM logs GROUP BY error ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC")
    List<Log> countError();
}

But the Log class does not have any numberOfErr field. So what actually this method should return?
