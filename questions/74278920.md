# Importing a type declared with Type::Library in the same file but a different package?

Why doesn't the following code, ripped directly from the docs, work?
package Types::Mine {
   use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);
   use Type::Library -base;
   use Type::Tiny;

   my $NUM = "Type::Tiny"->new(
      name       => "Number",
      constraint => sub { looks_like_number($_) },
      message    => sub { "$_ ain't a number" },
   );

   __PACKAGE__->meta->add_type($NUM);

   __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
}

When I try to ->import it from the same file.
package main {
  use v5.30;
  BEGIN { Types::Mine->import( qw(Number) ) };
  die Number;
}

I'm getting,
Could not find sub 'Number' exported by Types::Mine at /tmp/test.pl line 20.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /tmp/test.pl line 20.

Shouldn't you be able to import a type library declared in the same file, though a different package, with
BEGIN { Types::Mine->import( qw(Number) ) };
