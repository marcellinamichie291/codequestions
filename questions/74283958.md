so im trying to translate my c to mips and im having trouble with translating the array. the array is supposed to be the track in my car racing game and idk how to translate it to mips.
this is what i have in c
void setup()
{
    // starting elements
    score = 0;
    gameOver = 0;
    level = 0;
    arr[100][2];
    n = 100;
    x = TRACK_HEIGHT/2;
    y = TRACK_WIDTH/2;

how do i translate the array to mips?
not sure what to do since its not a numerical array where it displays a number
