# How to convert a Float to a UInt32

I'm trying to covert a Float to a UInt32. This code seems to work:
func floatToUInt(float: Float) -> UInt32
{
    return unsafeBitCast(float as Float, to: UInt32.self)
}

The compiler complains that 'unsafeBitCast' from 'Float' to 'UInt32' can be replaced with 'bitPattern' property on 'Float'. If I follow the recommendation, it turns it into this:
func floatToUInt(float: Float) -> UInt32
{
    return float as Float.bitPattern
}

But Xcode then complains with an error:

Property 'bitPattern' is not a member type of 'Float'

What is the best way of doing this?
