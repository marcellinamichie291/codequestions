# Finding Age from birthdate

Hello I have written out a piece of code but can't seem to get it to work and I'm not sure how to input my data from the dob and turn it into the age. I was wondering how I could write that using my %d as a placeholder for my dob data?
This is the code I have so far but it's saying I am missing an argument.
from datetime import date

class Person:
  def __init__(self, id, name, dob):
    self.id = id
    self.name = name
    self.dob = dob

  def Greeting(self):
    print("Hello my name is %s" % self.name)  
    
  def calcAge(dob):
    today = date.today()
    dob = today.year - dob.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (dob.month, dob.day))

    return dob
  print("I am %d" % calcAge(), 'years old')
   
p1 = Person(2315, "John", "6/13/2005")
p1.calcAge()
p1.Greeting()
print(p1.Greeting)
p1.id = 4506
p1.name = "Bob"
p1.dob = '3/8/2003'
p1.calcAge()
