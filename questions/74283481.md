# Julia Stochastic Differential Equation Very Slow

Please help me figure out why my code is sooo slow and possible ways to speed it up. I have used vectorization, @inbounds, column major indexing, @floop, and preallocation so I would think it would be faster. I am at a loss...
The code simulates a stochastic wave of cells (as in biological cells) and mutant cells. I am using the Euler-Murayama method to propagate the coupled (Chemical Langevin) equations:


Where W/M denotes the number of wild-type cells and mutant cells respectively, K is the carrying capacity (maximum number of cells), i denotes the deme (location), and N(0,1) is a normal random variable.
Here is a graphic of the waves after some time propagating:

I have attached the important part of the code below, and tried to comment it as best as I could.
using Random, Distributions
using StatsBase
using Statistics
using FLoops

# CLE Parameters/Set-Up:
K = 100 # Carrying capacity (maximum number of cells)
M = 100 # Number of demes (locations)
T = 100_000_000 # number of time steps
dt = 1e-1 # time increment
g = Normal(0.0,sqrt(dt)) # normal distribution with ave = 0.0, std_dev = dt
r_w = 0.1 # Wild-type growth rate
r_m = 0.2 # Mutant growth rate
r_wm = [r_w, r_m]' # Growth rate vector (transposed)
N = 1 # number of independent processes (slow even when N = 1)

# initial wave (essentially a step-function of wild-types 
# with 100 mutants at deme (location) 76)
state_init = Matrix(reshape(repeat([K, 0.0]',M+2),(M+2,2))) 
state_init[MÃ·2+2:end,1] .= 0   
state_init[76,2] = 100.0
state_init[1,:] .= [K,0]
state_init[end,:] .= [0,0]

state = deepcopy(state_init)
state_plus = zeros(size(state_init)) # state at demes i+1 instead of i (used for derivatives)
state_minus = zeros(size(state_init)) # state at demes i-1 instead of i (used for derivatives)

    @inbounds @floop for n in 1:N
        state .= deepcopy(state_init) # initialize state

            state_plus .= circshift(state, -1) # make plus state
            state_plus[1,:] .= [0,0] # fix boundary conditions
            state_minus .= circshift(state, 1) # make minus state
            state_minus[end,:] .= [0,0] # fix boundary conditions
            state_shift = circshift(state, (0,1))

... the rest of the code is analysis and not the reason the code is slow.
