# IIS Performance - First load of aspx pages

I have several projects in asp.net and in all of them I have the same problem. The first time I access an aspx page the load is very slow. Once I close the page and reopen it, the load is very fast. Why is the first load so slow? Can I change any settings in IIS?
Thanks
I have read a lot of documentation but I am not an expert in this and I have not gotten any progress.
