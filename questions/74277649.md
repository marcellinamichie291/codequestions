# How do I show a loading screen/icon while loading a view that requires querying a database? Asp.Net Core C#

Currently I have a view that has just a single form with three values. When a user submits the form with those three values, my controller checks if all three values actually have a value other than being empty, and if they do then it calls my service that fetches data.
        public IActionResult Index(string clientName = "", string tableName = "", string date = "")
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(clientName) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(tableName) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(date))
            {
                // Unimportant stuff for setting temp variables for FetchData parameters removed
                TheData = _fieldDataService.FetchData(tempAcr, tempID, tableName, date, numRows);
            }
            return View(TheData);
        }

My goal is to make the view display a loading icon or something while the data is being fetched. I've looked into JQuery and Ajax but I have no experience with either and cannot figure out how to apply them to my specific task. Since I am using Asp.Net Core, I also looked into using Blazor, but I couldn't wrap my head around it either.
Could somebody point me in the right direction as to what I should/could use to solve this problem? I have a vague understanding that there needs to be some sort of asynchronous function that retrieves the data, but nothing more than that.
