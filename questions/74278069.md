# Testing my FASTAPI repository module with mocking db connection

I am working on a FastAPI project and i need to run unit tests for my repositories folder.
My project structure is this:
main_folder:
-api_tests
-apis
-models
-repositories
 -healthcheck_repo.py
-services
-tests
 -test_healthcheck_repo

Also in main i have:
- app.py
- db_connection.py
- settings.py

I need to perform unit tests on healthcheck_repo.py and i am stuck.
I need to use async session Mock with __aenter__ magic method to get cursor Mock execute and then get cursor Mock fetchone(). After that i need to session Mock execute.assert_called_with("select one as dummy") followed by cursor mock.fetchone.assert_called_once()
This is my healthcheck_repo.py:
from updateservice.db_connection import async_session


class HealthCheckRepo:
    async def healthcheck_db(self):
        async with async_session() as session:
            cursor = await session.execute("select 1 as dummy")
            result = cursor.fetchone()
        return result

This is my test_healthcheck_repo.py:
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from unittest import mock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch('updateservice.repositories.healthcheck_repo.async_session')
async def test_healthcheck_repo_functionality(async_session):
    async with async_session as session:
        cursor_mock = session.mock.return_value.__aenter__return_value    
        session.mock.execute.assert_called_with("select 1 as dummy")
        cursor_mock.fetchone.assert_called_once()

Can someone help me solve this test? Thank you!
