# Razor Page update page based on previous actions

I'm making a page to select a dashboard based on certain filter values.
The idea is to show a first selector, with all the possible projects which contains a dashboard. Then based on that selection, I want to show the next selector, with the version of that dashboard.
How do I Update the Page based on the selection made in the first selector?
For the model, what I got so far is :
        [BindProperty(SupportsGet = true)]
        public SelectListItem ProjectNumber { get; set; }
        public List<SelectListItem> ProjectenDisplay { get; set; }

        public IndexModel(ILogger<IndexModel> logger, GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _graphServiceClient = graphServiceClient;
        }

        public async Task OnGet()
        {
            var user = await _graphServiceClient.Me.Request().GetAsync();
            ViewData["GraphApiResult"] = user.DisplayName;
            GetProjects();

        }
        private void GetProjects()
        {
            using (var context = new PdDashboardsContext())
            {
                ProjectenDisplay = context.Projectens.Where(q => q.DashboardId != null)
                    .Select(q => new SelectListItem
                    {
                        Value = q.ProjectOmschrijving,
                        Text = $"{q.ProjectNummer} : {q.ProjectOmschrijving}"
                    }).ToList();
            }
        }

and for the html :
@page
@using PD_Dashboards.Models
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}
<h1>Select project</h1>
<select class="form-select"
        name="ProjectSelector"
        asp-items="Model.ProjectenDisplay"
        asp-for="ProjectNumber">
    <option value="">Select a number</option>
</select>
@if(null != @Model.ProjectNumber )
{
    <h1>@Model.ProjectNumber.Value</h1>
}

The if statement in the html is only run in the beginning, so therefore not updating when the selection updates. However I need to update the page based on the value of the selector.
I know I can make a form and call OnPost to update values, but then I still have the issue of not dynamically building the page based on choices made before.
