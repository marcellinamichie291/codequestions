# Use file timestamps as commit dates

I often work on a number of different files over some time before I get around to committing that work.
The work should then often go into multiple commits, not only one.
It would be nice if those commits would not show the current time, but rather a reasonable approximation of when I actually finished the work that is in them.
One approach for getting such an approximation would be to use the mtime file timestamp of the youngest file that goes into the commit.
Example
Assume I have worked on files a, b, c, d.
a and b should go into commit 1,
c d into commit 2.
I would like to do something like this:
git add a b
git commit --date=files -m"modified a and b"

and have git use the timestamp of either a or b for the commit, whichever is younger.
As far as I can see, there is no support for this in git.
Does anybody know why? It sounds like a useful functionality to me.
Can anybody recommend a helper program that would do this?
(For the use as sketched above, this is easy, but when further changes are done to a or b after the git add, it becomes a lot more difficult.)
