# Spring raw query parameters in Criteria condition

I would like to bind in Criteria raw sql condition, like functions BINARY(...) or CAST(...). But i can't find any solution for this case.
I have those code
Criteria.where("m.originator").is("BINARY('test')")
When i unwrap this condition, it is looks like
m.originator = 'BINARY('test')' but i want m.originator = BINARY('test') without quotes
How i can do this?
