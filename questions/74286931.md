# vuejs dev server connecting to unknown websocket service

I wanted to test some vuejs frontend I've made. And when connecting it to Rest API, I saw in browser network diagnostic that the app is constantly trying to connect to server on websockets with some credentials and get declined, because of CORS.
I would like to know, what part of vue dev server is trying to connect to websockets and how to disable this feature. It's annoying and it doesn't really help me with anything, just polluting my debug window.
Thanks in advance.

Where does this come from?
