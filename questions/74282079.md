# When is a schedule active the next time?

We are trying to solve a somewhat simple question, but are struggling with finding a good code solution:

Given weekdays, minutes, start date, end date and current time plus timezone - how long, in seconds, until the schedule becomes active for the next time, i.e. all conditions are met


weekdays: given as array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
minutes: given as array [0,1,2,...1439] (a day has 1440 minutes, if "7" is in the array then the minute 00:07 until 00:08 activates the schedule)
start date: Given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
end date: Given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
current time: Given as e.g. unix timestamp
timezone: E.g. "America/Vancouver" - note that these dictate time changes

All conditions are met for a given time when:

the weekday for that time in the given timezone is part of the weekday array
the minute for that time is the given timezone is part of the minute array and
the date for that time in the given timezone is between the start and end date (inclusive)

I'm posting a function that somewhat works, but I am very unsure about correctness. It also feels extremely complicated. Is there an easier way to solve the question?
We are currently using moment-timezone, but are open to other libraries:
import moment from 'moment-timezone';

// Returns 0 if schedule currently active, otherwise seconds until next active or null if no future active
export const checkActive = ({
  startDate, endDate, minutes, weekDays, timezone
}) => {
  const now = moment.tz(moment.now(), timezone);
  const nowDateObj = new Date(now.format(moment.HTML5_FMT.DATE));
  const start = moment.tz(new Date(startDate), timezone);
  const startDateObj = new Date(start.format(moment.HTML5_FMT.DATE));
  const endDateObj = new Date(endDate === null ? '9999-01-01' : endDate);
  endDateObj.setMinutes(minutes[minutes.length - 1]);

  const nowMinute = now.hours() * 60 + now.minutes();
  let startMinute = minutes.find((m) => m >= nowMinute);

  for (
    let date = nowDateObj > startDateObj ? nowDateObj : startDateObj;
    date <= endDateObj;
    date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1)
  ) {
    if (startMinute !== undefined && weekDays.includes(date.getDay() % 7)) {
      const startTime = moment.tz(date.toISOString().slice(0, 10), timezone).set({
        hour: Math.floor(startMinute / 60),
        minute: startMinute % 60
      });
      return Math.max(startTime.unix() - now.unix(), 0);
    }
    startMinute = minutes[0];
  }
  return null;
};

Test example:
     {
        startDate: '2022-10-31',
        endDate: '2022-10-31',
        minutes: [
          405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412,
          413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420,
          421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428,
          429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436,
          437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444,
          445, 446, 447, 448, 449
        ],
        weekDays: [
          0, 1, 2, 3,
          4, 5, 6
        ],
        timezone: 'Etc/GMT+12'
      }

with a current time of '2022-10-31T04:56:57.000Z' we expect the result to be 7 * 60 * 60 + 3 * 60 + 3 + 6 * 60 * 60 + 45 * 60 = 49683.
