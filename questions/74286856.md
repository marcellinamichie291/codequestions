# CSS - stack two elements on top of each other

I have a stackblitz here
This should be the simplest thing but I can't see why its not working.
I have react app with Typescript and a styled components, I'm sure none of that is the problem this is just css.
I'm trying to position two divs on top of each other.
The container has position: relative;
And then the div are absolutely positioned.
.FlexContainerColOne,
.FlexContainerColTwo{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}

But both div disappear, what am I missing
