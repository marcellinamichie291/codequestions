# Connecting to Firebase Auth emulator using firebase-js-sdk in Node environment is throwing an error

I am using the 'firebase' client npm package to do client side testing (creating users with email and password), in a node.js environment.
I am following the example given in the docs...
https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_firestore#web-version-9
Following that example, my code is as follows...
const firebaseAuth = require('firebase/auth');
const auth = firebaseAuth.getAuth();
firebaseAuth.connectAuthEmulator(auth, 'http://localhost:9099');

And the exception being thrown is...
Uncaught Error FirebaseError: Firebase: Need to provide options, when not being deployed to hosting via source. (app/no-options).
