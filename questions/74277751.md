# Are there any other ways of starting MongoDB?

I've been learning MongoDB and Mongoose for quite some time now, but I don't know if there are any other (easier/quicker) ways of starting MongoDB. The way I start it now is I open PowerShell (I'm on Windows) and type out or paste this command:
C:/Users/Administrator/mongodb/bin/mongod.exe --dbpath=C:/Users/Administrator/mongodb-data

It gets a little bit boring to always paste that command every time. I did google it, but didn't find any straight answers.
