# inheritance of select in JS / JSON

I have a small question in JS / JSON. I will need to make selects whose data would depend on the previous ones. Let me explain :
I have a JSON "type" which has in data:


[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "title": "fruit"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "vegetables"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "meat"
  },
]



I have a second "food" which has data:


[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "title": "apple",
    "typeId": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "strawberry",
    "typeId": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "chicken",
    "typeId": 2
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "beef",
    "typeId": 2
  },
]



And a last one "specie" with these data :


[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "titre": "green",
    "foodId": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "titre": "red",
    "foodId": 1
  }
]



I would like three input selects in my HTML.
The first will list the types, and depending on which one I choose I'll want the data from the second select to fit. For example if I choose "fruit" I would like to have in my second input select "apple" and "strawberry". The third input will also change depending on the data of the second. So if I select "apple" we will have the choice between "green" and "red"
How could I get this result in JS?
Thanks in advance !
