# PowerShell ISE line breakpoints not respected

I'm opening a script in PowerShell ISE and manually setting line breakpoints in several places.
To check if PS properly registered them, I'm running Get-PSBreakpoint and indeed, I can see them on the list.
Next, I'm running the script (F5). As expected, it stops on the first breakpoint. It also stops on all other breakpoints.
At some point I terminate the script (red square).
Before running it again I confirm the current breakpoints by running Get-PSBreakpoint and all previous line breakpoints are still there. They are also still marked with the brown background on the screen.
However, if I run the script again, none of the line breakpoints is respected, the sript simply ignores them. To make them work again I have to toggle them manually (basically set them again).
Environment:
Windows Server 2016
PSVersion: 5.1
This issue occurs in one script that I modified recently.
One of the things I changed is introducing a 'using' statement, which loads a module (psm1) with assemblies and some custom classes.
When I remove the 'using' line, the problem disappears.
When I remove everything inside the module introduced with the 'using' statement, but keep the 'using' statement in the main script, the problem persists.
Has someone come across such problem? Any idea what makes 'using' interfere with line breakpoints?
