# useEffect() in React doesn't rendering Immediately

when I use 'useEffect()' Hooks in react, it cannot render Immediately.
I called axios() function in useEffect.
so I tried to useState. variable 'update' is useEffect's second property and if 'update' is true get data from axios function.
but they dosen't render my page :(
