# How to make programs executing in console faster？

This is my system information：
CPU:    Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz
Mem:    RAM 16.0 GB (15.9 GB Available)
Windows Version: Windows 11 Professional 22H2 22622.586
Pagefile Size: 4096-8192MB

And I often close my computer with Windows' hibernate.
Now if I execute program in Intellij IDEA or Windows' console，sometimes the program will become very slow，and I must reboot my system or change another computer to finish my task, and this is very not convinient.
Are there anyone can tell me how to solve this?

This is my benchmark program:
https://github.com/iHeadWater/station-simulator/blob/master/dijkstra_conda/dfs_path_test.py#L383
When it's normal, a cycle(writing a "stream")only use serveral seconds, but when it become slow,a cycle will spend for 5-10 minutes，and I'm sure cost of operations in the program should be stable(because I have run it for several times).
I minimized my console window(not only idea but also windows)but it has no effort,and it's Intellij IDEA which occupies the most memories (about 3GB), and python.exe occupies about 20% of CPU.
I don't think enlarge memory of IDEA can solve this, because the new computer which I run my benchmark program has only 1024MB memory.
