# SSO logout from Microsoft Account ever where, is it possible to logout only for specific Azure AD Enterprise application?

We Implemented SSO using .Net Core 6, ITfoxtec framework (https://www.itfoxtec.com/identitysaml2) and Azure AD Enterprise application. everything is working as expected, while logging out we use following code, which logged out user from Microsoft account and as result the user also logged off from other applications as well, can we log out user only for specific Azure AD enterprise application?
[HttpPost("Logout")]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<IActionResult> Logout()
{
if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
return Redirect(Url.Content("~/"));
    }

var binding = new Saml2PostBinding();
var saml2LogoutRequest = await new Saml2LogoutRequest(config, User).DeleteSession(HttpContext);
return **binding.Bind(saml2LogoutRequest).ToActionResult();** /* logged out from Microsoft application */
}

var saml2LogoutRequest = await new Saml2LogoutRequest(config, User).DeleteSession(HttpContext);
delete cookies as expected, our application does not have custom log in page, as soon as user hit webpage it will redirect user to log-in and because Azure AD session is still active it land user on home page. what we want is, once user logged out from the application and hit web page again it should ask to select Microsoft account to log-in.
[Route("Login")]
public IActionResult Login(string returnUrl = null)
{
var binding = new Saml2RedirectBinding();
    binding.SetRelayStateQuery(new Dictionary<string, string> 
        { { relayStateReturnUrl, returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/") } });

return binding.Bind(new Saml2AuthnRequest(config)).ToActionResult();
}

following is Azure AD Enterprise application SAML configuration
