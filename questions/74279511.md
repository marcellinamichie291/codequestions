Java beginner here, I keep getting a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on the line with the if statement, before I'm even prompted to enter anything on the previous line. Not sure why this is happening, I even have other versions of this in other bits of my code that are identical and work fine so I'm not sure what the issue is.
valid = false;
String maritalStatus = null;
while (!valid) {
    valid = true;
    System.out.println("Enter marital status: ");
    maritalStatus = input.nextLine();
    if (!(maritalStatus.charAt(0) == 's' || maritalStatus.charAt(0) == 'S' || maritalStatus.charAt(0) == 'm' || maritalStatus.charAt(0) == 'M')) {
        System.out.println("Error: marital status must either be single or married");
        valid = false;
    }
}

I've tried just copy and pasting from the earlier examples but I still get the error.
