I'm just start reading, Python Crash Course and I have some trouble I guess in chapter 6 with :
aliens = []

for alien_number in range(30):
    new_alien = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}
    aliens.append(new_alien)

for alien in aliens[0:3]:
    if alien['color'] == 'green':
        alien['color'] = 'yellow'
        alien['speed'] = 'medium'
        alien['points'] = 10
    elif alien['color'] =='yellow':
        alien['color'] = 'red'
        alien['speed'] = 'fast'
        alien['points'] = 15

for alien in aliens[0:5]:
    print(alien)

I was making my own code, but have the same problem as in an example. The code just stuck on first 'if' and aliens change only from green to yellow((, i got 3 yellow aliens and 2 green, like im only using 'if' part, and as i understand it should skip part with yellow and give me 3 red and 2 green lines
Thx u so much
It should change from green to yellow and from yellow to red, in book he used only if, elif, that's it
