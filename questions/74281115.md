# ModuleNotFound error only in Flask subfolders, not in root

I am having a very annoying problem with module imports within a Flask app.
This is my file structure:
root > app > views > tests

In the views folder, there is a file called data.py. I wish to import this into a file called test_data.py in tests:
from app.views import data

This gives a ModuleNotFound error, saying that app is not a module (I have added an __init__.py file, although I believe this is no longer needed in Python 3).
However, in the root (foo) folder, I have another file that is using exactly the same absolute import successfully:
from app.views import data

Can anybody help me out, please, with how I am able to import successfully into files other than the root folder?
