# CodeDeploy running outdated appspec, scripts file

I configured appspec.yml as below:
`
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
 - source: /war/stg/ROOT.war
    destination: /opt/iplass01/tomcat/webapps/
file_exists_behavior: OVERWRITE
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/stop_tomcat_server
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/delete_root_resource
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_tomcat_server
      timeout: 300
      runas: root

`
Scenario as below:

Step 1: Run CodeDeploy successully
Step 2: Change something on appspec.yml or scripts. Ex:
stop_tomcat_server, delete_root_resource, start_tomcat_server
Step 3: Run CodeDeploy again but result is failed.
...
Step N: Run CodeDeploy again but result is still failed.

Do you have any idea to resolved that's problems?
Expectation:
Step 2: when we update appspec.yml or scripts and run CodeDeploy again CodeDeploy will run successfully with up to date configuration(appspec.yml or scripts).
