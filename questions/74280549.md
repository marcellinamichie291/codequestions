# Nested tqdm progressbar not on same position during run

My code consist of a double loop. I want to have a double tqdm progress bar, with the first keeping track of the outer loop, and the second keeping track of the inner loop. They should keep their position; only the inner loop progress bar should be cleared and start at zero at every outer iteration. The code I have now looks like this:
from tqdm import tqdm
from time import sleep

outer_loop = 2
inner_loop = 3

pbar_outer = tqdm(total=outer_loop, position=0, leave=True, ncols=80, ascii=True)

for n in range(outer_loop):
    pbar_outer.set_description(f"outer iteration {n + 1}")
    pbar_outer.update()
    sleep(1)

    pbar_inner = tqdm(total=inner_loop, position=1, leave=False, ncols=80, ascii=True)
    for m in range(inner_loop):
        pbar_inner.set_description(f"inner iteration {m + 1}")
        pbar_inner.update()
        sleep(1)

    pbar_inner.close()

pbar_outer.close()

Although this works, the problem is that the inner loop progress bar keeps be written to a new line during each iteration. The output looks like this:
outer iteration 1:   0%|                                  | 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
  0%|                                                     | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
inner iteration 1:   0%|                                  | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
inner iteration 2:  33%|########6                 | 1/3 [00:01<00:02,  1.00s/it]
inner iteration 2:  67%|#################3        | 2/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.00it/s]
inner iteration 3:  67%|#################3        | 2/3 [00:02<00:00,  2.00it/s]

As you can, there are several problems. Most notably is that the second progress bar is not kept on the same position, but written to a new line. In case I use position=0  for the second progress bar, the position is kept fixed, but then the second bar is plotted right on top of the first bar. Other problems are that the progress bar is initiated with an empty message (the default), and then plotted again with the first message. Also, the third inner iteration is plotted twice: one time with 67%, and then with 100%.
Hopefully anybody has some advice on having 2 nested progress bars using the tqdm module which are kept on a fixed position.
