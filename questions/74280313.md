# Flutter/Dart: return not waiting "toList" with async function to finish

I'm working on an API sync using Flutter and SQFLite.
I get the data from the API, map it, and then add to SQL item by item:
    return (response as List).map((tmp) {
      print('• API: apiSync - Inserting News');
      DBProvider.db.updateNews(ArtNews.fromJson(tmp));
    }).toList();

Everything works fine, but there is a small problem: the return is called before the 'updateNews' is done.
updateNews is a simple async function that writes data on SQFLite.
This creates a big issue: the app opens before the sync is over and data is still being written on DB.
I've tried using AWAIT, but it doesn't make any effect:
   (response as List).map((tmp) async{
      print('• API: apiSync - Inserting $type');
      await DBProvider.db.updateNews(ArtNews.fromJson(tmp));
    }).toList();
    return 'done';

updateNews is called dozens of times, the toList ends, returns 'done', but the updateNews is still adding content to the DB.
I guess there is something I'm missing on toList or async. Any ideas? Thanks!
