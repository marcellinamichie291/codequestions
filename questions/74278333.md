# Allow vertical overflow for popup menu inside horizontal-scrolling container

I have a container element that has its overflow-x set to auto so it will allow horizontal scrolling when the viewport is too narrow to show all its content.
Inside this container I have a popup context menu. The menu is positioned absolute in relation to its container that has position: relative.
My problem is that the menu triggers vertical scrolling on the container element instead of simply overflowing.
Is there any way to allow the menu to overflow vertically whilst preserving the horizontal scrolling of the container.
See snippet for demonstration of the problem


#container {
  background: salmon;
  overflow-x: auto;
  display: flex;
  padding: 12px;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

#long-content {
  white-space: nowrap;
}

#menu-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  background: yellow;
}

#popout-menu {
  background: green;
  position: absolute;
}
<div id="container">
  <div id="menu-container">
    <span>...</span>
    <nav id="popout-menu">
      <ul>
        <li>A thing</li>
        <li>Another thing</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
  <div id="long-content">Some long content here that might cause the row to overflow the viewport</div>
</div>
