# Weka Correctly classified instances not showing

Im using bike sharing dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
And trying to find the accuracy in Weka
and I picked "holiday" as label and changed it's data type to nominal but Correctly classified instances is not showing at all.
What to do?
