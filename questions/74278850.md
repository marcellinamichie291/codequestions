# Function that works on both Num and List

I am doing this as an pattern matching exercise.
I would like to have a function that will work on both Num type and List type. For example:
double 20
double [1,2,3,4,5]

The code works till
double [] = []
double (x : xs) = (2 * x) : (double xs)

main = do
    let x = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print (double x)

But when I try:
double x = x + x
double [] = []
double (x : xs) = (2 * x) : (double xs)

main = do
    let x = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print (double 20)
    print (double x)

It gives error.
What should be done here?
