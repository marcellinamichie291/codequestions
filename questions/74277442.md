# compiling SSTP plugin for network-manager on Raspberry Pi

I'm trying to install sstp VPN plugin for network manager on raspbian arm64. There is no available sstp plugin on the repository for network-manager so I'm assuming I have to compile it by myself. I've been searching online for any available instruction but I couldn't find any. So I appreciate if anyone could give me any information regarding this issue.
I also tried sstp-client package on terminal but that one also wasn't successfull for me. I coulnd't maintain the sstp connection. So currently network-manager-sstp plugin is my last hope. I'm using arm64 debian bullseye Raspbian.
