Hi I am new to Python SubProcess module and need your help here. I need git log output using Python's subprocess module. I am writing this code in Windows.
I wrote small piece of code to validate the use of shell commands using Python Script, I am first trying to issue shell command as moveto C drive C:,then going to directory where git folder exists and then i would like to see git log information from this git repository. I am able to see return code as zero but i do not see git log output.
Can you please help me here. Appreciate your help.
Here is sample piece of code
import subprocess

p1 = subprocess.run([r'C:',r'C:\SOME_GIT_DIRECTORY','git log -1'], shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)

  
print(p1.returncode)
print(p1.stdout)
print(p1.stderr)
