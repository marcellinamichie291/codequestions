# Retrive Window Handle in Class Library WinUI3

I am trying to use the PrintManager in a WinUI3 class library project. But with WinUI, currently, we can only use PrintManager if we have the windows handle(HWND) unlike UWP where we could simply use ForCurrentView() without any parameters.
Here is something similar (the difference is they call the PrintManager in UI project itself and not a different class library) https://github.com/marb2000/PrintSample. In this, we retrieve the HWND using the below API:
var hWnd = WinRT.Interop.WindowNative.GetWindowHandle(this);
Notice that in the above line a Window object needs to be injected. This is not available to me currently in my class library which will be consumed by a UI project.
Could we retrieve the Windows Handle in the class library without injecting it from the UI code that will be using the library?
