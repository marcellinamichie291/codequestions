# Validate subclasses' variables for uniqueness

Suppose I have a simple ABC and some subclasses
from abc import ABC


class BaseClass(ABC):
    var: str


class Child1(BaseClass):
    var = 'foo'


class Child2(BaseClass):
    var = 'foo'

Is there any way to validate that var is unique among all subclasses?
