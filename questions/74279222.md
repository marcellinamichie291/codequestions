# Order column based on data in another column in R (tidyverse)

Ideally looking for a tidyverse solution to the following.
I have data which comes to me in random order.  Every row has a unique four digit identifier (labeled ID below).  I group it initially by a date column (simple enough).  Another column indicates what the previous row should be within that date (labeled Prev_ID below).  The first row for a given date has an Prev_ID which will not refer to something within that date.  I want an output ordered like the following:
Date    ID    Prev_ID
1/1    8731    1436  
1/1    4522    8731
1/1    1301    4522
1/2    6675    3690
1/2    9123    6675
1/2    0025    9123

I've tried creating some loops to do this but I'm getting a bit lost in the weeds, and because I'm dealing with a lot of data, I'm worried about it being slow.  Seems like there should be a simple solution here.
Thoughts?
