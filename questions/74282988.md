# How to write an odata filter in a logic app where field has date time and I just want to use date portion

There is a record in the Salesforce Stay Information which has the following information. "Booked_Check_in_Date_Time__c": "2022-11-05T00:59:00Z"
When I try the following oData filter it does not work.
Booked_Check_in_Date_Time__c eq 2022-11-05
What do I need to change to bring back this record.
