# move folder from dbfs location to user workspace directory in azure databricks

I need to move group of files(python or scala file from)or folder from dbfs location to user workspace directory to do testing on file.
Its verify difficult to upload each file one by one into the user workspace directory, so is it possible to move file from dbfs location to user workspace directory in azure databricks.
Since i am not able to upload folder instead of file directly or huge than some particular size, could you suggest the way to move or copy files into user workspace directory in azure databricks.
