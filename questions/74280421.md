# Blazor Server app not working with Edge but working in Chrome

We have an existing Blazor server application that we've developed that has some pages suddenly become unresponsive when using Edge, however the same application works as expected when using Chrome.
When inspecting the console output in Edge there is no indication of any error.  When debugging in VS 2022, no breakpoints are hit in the unresponsive pages so we've got little information about the what/why of the problem.
Has anyone else experienced this?
Details:

VS 2022 Enterprise v17.3.6
