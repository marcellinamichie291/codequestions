# Force return from Native Transition in Visual Studio

I'm trying to unfreeze a program that I didn't develop and don't have the source for.
It's stuck here, I guess waiting for Windows to respond:


It won't let me move the arrow to just skip the line, and I can't change the value of eax. Is there something I can do here like force it to have an exception or somehow step into the native code further?
I just want this program to break free from its loop and start responding, so if there's some other method, that would also be a huge help.
