# How to protect image folder with middleware in NodeJS

const auth = require("./api/middleware/check-auth.interceptor");
app.use("/images/cars", auth, express.static("images/cars"));
app.use("/images/repairs", express.static("images/repairs"));

I'm designing an admin panel, only the admin needs to access the image folder by the frontend. With the CheckAuth interceptor, I can protect other http requests from outside access. However, this method was not successful in the image folder
