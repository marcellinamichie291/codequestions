# How Measure the functional test coverage for automation tests?

I am working on the project which is having automation test for each feature/module using Javascript Cypress. Wanted to measure the functional test coverage for automation tests. Is there tool/idea/way to measure the functional test coverage for automation tests? This is not regarding the automation test code coverage. We know for test code coverage number of tools/library available and this is more about functional test coverage.
