# CSS hover on all elements not working as expected

I have tried to add a hover effect to every element in the website but *:hover is not working.
I have tried different html tags, but only some will allow this hover to work, like the a tag in the example


*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

* {
  border: solid .5px #dbdbdb;
}

*:hover {
  border: solid .5px #737373;
}
<div>
