# Add Items to Columns in a WPF ListView

I've been struggling for a while now to add items to 2 columns in a ListView. In my Windows Forms application I had a something like this:
// In my class library:
public void AddItems(ListView listView)
{
    var item = new ListViewItem {Text = "Some Text for Column 1"};
    item.SubItems.Add("Some Text for Column 2");

    listView.Items.Add(item);
}

I would then call this class from my Form.cs.
How can I do this in WPF? Preferably, I wouldn't like to use a lot of XAML.
