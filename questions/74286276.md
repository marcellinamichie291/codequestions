I have an array of objects let's say processDetails. I want to convert it into an array of objects where each object has only two fields instead of every other field. How do I go about it?
"processDetails" : [ 
        {
            "process": "details",
            "stage": "done",
            "status": "collected",
            "updatedAt" : ISODate("2017-11-04T04:53:54.623Z"),
            "updatedBy" : "BuubebcikkMdFo5Np",
            "history" : [ 
                {
                    "status": "pending",
                    "createdAt" : ISODate("2017-11-04T04:53:54.257Z"),
                    "createdBy": "BuubebcikkMdFo5Np",
                    "assignedTo" : "BuubebcikkMdFo5Np"
                }, 
                {
                    "status": "collected",
                    "notes": null,
                    "createdAt" : ISODate("2017-11-04T04:53:54.623Z"),
                    "createdBy": "BuubebcikkMdFo5Np",
                    "assignedTo": "BuubebcikkMdFo5Np"
                }
            ],
            "incomplete": null
        }
]

"processDetails" : [ 
        {
            "process": "details",
            "stage": "done"
        }
]
