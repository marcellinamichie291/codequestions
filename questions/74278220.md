# force sub classes to initialize a property of the super class

I have an abstract calss Report :
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
public abstract class Report {
    private String surrogateId;
.
.
.

and I need to force all subclasses to fill this surrogateId property. (to have a compilation error if the subclass doesn't fill the property)
@Data
@Document(collection = "active_report")
@NoArgsConstructor
public class ReportActiveDevicesNotLinkedWithIO extends Report {
    private String active;
.
.
.
}


I've tried to use final keyword that enforce me to introduce the value of this property in the constructor,
but i've to generate the constructor manually instead of using Lombok, so many boilerplate code.
is there a way to acheive the same expectation without generating the construcor manually.
