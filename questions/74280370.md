# Pass data from JSP in IE to HTML Page in EDGE

Is there a way to pass the data from JSP page in IE to HTML page in EDGE.
Or create the global variable in JSP and access the values in HTML page with JavaScript or ajax ?
I am opening the html page with windows.open(microsoft-edge:http://Map.html);
Thank you in advance.
