# How to connect a PoE router to another router to extend connectivity


Hello!
This is my old 4G LTE Wi-Fi router with a PoE port that connects to an outdoor antenna. I am thinking of connecting it to my new TP-Link TL-WR840N Wi-Fi router to somehow extend connectivity and divert devices to the old router.
I've checked many websites describing how to connect 2 Wi-Fi routers to extend connectivity but they never mentioned any routers with PoE ports like mine which connects to an outdoor antenna.
Will it be safe to connect a cable from the PoE port going to the TP-Link router?
