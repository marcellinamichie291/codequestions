# How to send my Bearer Token in save and load request from the TradingView widget?

I develop my own backend while trying to implement TradingView's Save and Load Low-Level API, I could not find the way to add my Bearer Token into the LIST CHARTS (charts_storage_url/charts_storage_api_version/charts?client=client_id&user=user_id) or SAVE CHART (charts_storage_url/charts_storage_api_version/charts?client=client_id&user=user_id) request to do authorization on server.
Here is the flow: User logged in -> user draw something on the tradingview chart -> user clicks Save -> post request include Bearer token to authorize on Back End server.
Below is ajax call in trading view chart library

How do you send my Bearer Token in save and load request from the TradingView widget in an ReactJs Frontend?
I tried to find the widget config or the way to override ajax call in library?
