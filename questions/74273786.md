# Strugling to scrape titles with scrapy

I am currently trying to scrape a title via Scrapy's shell. https://cineb.art/movies is the website,
the title is located in :
   <h3 class="film-name">

When i type response.css("film-name").get() i get nothing in return



fetch('https://cineb.art/movies')
2022-11-01 12:17:24 [scrapy.core.engine] DEBUG: Crawled (200) <GET https://cineb.art/movies> (referer: None)>>> response.css('film-title').get()
response.css('film-name').get()
