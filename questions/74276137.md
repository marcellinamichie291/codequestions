# Tensorflow running slower after reboot

I had a working document to test out using tf.data.Datasets.
It was working very fast on GPU (because it was a very simple test model). I then shut down the computer overnight and on restart copied my tf.data.Datasets work flow to my main model where it ran very slowly.
On going back to the working document to check, this also now ran very slowly (the test script had not been altered).
Working document and warnings that might be appropriate below:
data_dir = 'D:/Training_data/temporary_tiles/2022_10_31/*/*'


#%%
def get_label(file_path):
    # use folder name for label
    str_label = tf.strings.split(file_path, os.sep)[-2]
    # make label binary
    label = tf.cond(tf.math.equal(str_label, tf.constant('forest', dtype=tf.string)), 
                lambda:tf.constant(1, shape=(1,)), 
                lambda:tf.constant(0, shape=(1,)))

    return label


def process_image(file_path):

    label = get_label(file_path)

    im = tf.io.read_file(file_path)
    im = tfio.experimental.image.decode_tiff(im)

    return im, label

ds = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(data_dir, shuffle=True)

ds = ds.map(process_image).batch(32) 

training_size = int(len(ds)*0.66)

Xy_train = ds.take(training_size)
Xy_test = ds.skip(training_size)

# simple model just to check it runs (was fast, now slow)
M = keras.Sequential()
M.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), input_shape=(32,32,4), activation=('relu')))
M.add(Flatten())
M.add(Dense(2, activation=('softmax')))
M.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizers.Adam(), metrics=["accuracy"])

M.fit(Xy_train, epochs=2)

On loading the ds I get:

Which seems to suggest it at first doesn't notice the GPU but the middle bit suggests it is running on GPU.
Running the model gets:
