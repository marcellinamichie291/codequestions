# How to add a response from the server to a state with an object in react

I have user state with object:
{
'login': 'somelogin',
 'pass': 'somepass'
}

Using this data, I send a request and receive a response in the form of several keys
const res  = await post("/api/login", user);

Response comes an object:
{
'xsrf': 'qweqweqwe', 
'session': 'asdasdasd'
}

How do i merge the current state with the response
so that in the user state it would be like this:
{
'login': 'somelogin', 
'pass': 'somepass', 
'xsrf': 'qweqweqwe', 
'session': 'asdasdasd'
}

I can't think of what to write in the state setUser
something like:
setUser(user + res.data)
I don't know much about javascript and can't figure it out
