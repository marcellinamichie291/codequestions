# What are thread names used for in Python?

I find that each thread has its own name such as Thread-1, Thread-2 and test_thread as shown below:
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=test)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=test)
thread3 = threading.Thread(target=test, name="test_thread")

print(thread1.name) # "Thread-1"
print(thread2.name) # "Thread-2"
print(thread3.name) # "test_thread"

But, I cannot find why each thread has its own name.
So, what are thread names used for?
