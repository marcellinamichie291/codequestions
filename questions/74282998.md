# Jdbi select with insanely long list as parameter to bindList

I have a query where I'd like to retrieve a huge amount of rows based on their pk ids, and use select .... where id in (<ids>) via the fluent api in JDBI like this:
jdbi(db).withHandle(h --> handle.createQuery(SQL).bindList("ids", listOfIds).mapToMap().list();

This works for as long as the number of ids doesn't exceed what the database (DB2) can handle in an in-clause. Obviously, in my case, the list of id's gets longer than Db2 can handle. So I split it into many in a List<List<Integer>> listOfIdLists and create a List<Map<String, Object>> result.
Now I have to somehow iterate over listOfIdLists and for each iteration add the result to result. Here is one of many tested variants:
       List<Map<String, Object>> result = new ArrayList<>();
       List<List<Integer>> listOfIdLists = chopListToLists(ids, 10);

       Iterator<List<Integer>> oneChopIterator = listOfIdLists.iterator();
       while (oneChopIterator.hasNext()) {
            result.addAll(jdbi(db).withHandle(handle --> handle.createQuery(SQL).bindList("id", oneChopIterator.next()).mapToMap().list()));
       }

Obviously variants with chops.forEach and try (Handle h = jdbi(db).open();) { /* iterate and addAll */ } has been tried also.
All of this run in a Quarkus app, and I get exceptions from Arjuna when iterating. For testing, I can add to result without errors when there is no iterating, and I instead just pick the first element/list in chops.
The exception is:

This runs on Java 17 with latest Quarkus (2.13.3) and the ibm-drivers that come with quarkus-jdbc-db2. Jdbi version 3.34.0. Not running a native image.
The reason for the parameterized jdbi(db) is that the application has two datasources. It is replacing a db-job where two databases are linked and stuff copied from one database to the other with statements like insert into db1.mytable(a,b,c...) select a,b,c ... from db2.mytable where not exists (...);
The source db is on linux and the target on zOs. The app runs on Ubuntu 20.04.
So basically what the code do, is to retrieve all pk ids from each table in each database, use CollectionUtils.subtract(list1, list2) to identify ids missing from the target table, and then use the resulting list of ids to retrive the full rows via a select ... from ... where ids in (<ids>) query as described above. The list of Map<String, Object> which would be the result rows, would then be inserted into the other table where they are missing.
The question is; How to get this working without exceptions? I can brute-force this by deleting and inserting all rows, but I'd rather not.
