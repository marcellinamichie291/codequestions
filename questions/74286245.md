# Could not drop the last static partition in Oracle table

I have a table with the statically created partitions by range, monthly based:
...
PARTITION BY RANGE (expiration_time) INTERVAL (NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1, 'month')) (
  PARTITION p_2021_10 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-11-2021', 'DD-MM-YYYY')),
  PARTITION p_2021_11 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-12-2021', 'DD-MM-YYYY')),
  PARTITION p_2021_12 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-01-2022', 'DD-MM-YYYY')),
  PARTITION p_2022_01 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-02-2022', 'DD-MM-YYYY')),
  PARTITION p_2022_02 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-03-2022', 'DD-MM-YYYY'))
...

After those partitions, the rest of them are dynamically created by ORACLE DBMS:
P_2022_02   TIMESTAMP' 2022-03-01 00:00:00' <<< Last statically created partition
SYS_P18684  TIMESTAMP' 2022-04-01 00:00:00' <<< Dynamic partition 1
SYS_P18902  TIMESTAMP' 2022-05-01 00:00:00' <<< Dynamic partition 2
SYS_P19364  TIMESTAMP' 2022-06-01 00:00:00' <<< Dynamic partition 3
...

I have a procedure that removes the obsolete partitions, but it fails to drop the last statically created one:
ALTER TABLE TRANSACTION_LOG DROP PARTITION p_2022_02 UPDATE INDEXES

Error report -
ORA-14758: Last partition in the range section cannot be dropped
14758. 00000 -  "Last partition in the range section cannot be dropped"
*Cause:    An attempt was made to drop the last range partition of an interval
           partitioned table.
*Action:   Do not attempt to drop this partition.

Personally, I see no point why couldn't I remove the last statically created partition, when there are dynamically created partitions afterwards.
Does anyone know how to overcome this issue?
