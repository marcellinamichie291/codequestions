# How to avoid codefreeze when deployments past QA are in progress

We normally merge feature branches to the development branch(Development branch is deployed to QA) and from there RELEASE tags are created subsequently followed by deployments to staging and production. All has been implemented through AWS codepipeline. Problem we are facing is that once RELEASE branch is created, we go into code freeze and we cant get things into QA till production deployment is completed successfully(Think about scenario, if hotfix is needed in production, we need our development branch to be exactly what was deployed into production, prior to applying the hotfix). We are trying to figureout a way on how to avoid codefreeze while release is in progress. This is a high level description of our issue, would love to provide more details, if needed.

Thank you.
