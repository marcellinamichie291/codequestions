# Amplitude Unity iOS 'Amplitude\Amplitude.h' file not found

I added the Amplitude SDK to an existing Unity project, on Android it was fine, but for iOS when I try to build I get this error in xcode ... "'Amplitude\Amplitude.h' file not found"
Project uses Unity 2021.3.9f1 and Ar foundation
I get the same issue with a brand new Unity 2021.3.9f1 project, with nothing in it but the Amplitude SDK. I used the 2.6.0 amplitude-unity.unitypackage file from here https://github.com/amplitude/unity-plugin/releases
Has anyone else encountered this issue and is there a fix or workaround?
