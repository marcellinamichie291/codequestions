# Is there a way when using pd.read_csv to get type of value datetime.datetime not timestamp?

When I using parse_dates in read_csv, the type of date col is loaded as timestamp.
I want a  datetime.datetime object, not a timestamp.
Is there any way?
Do I need to convert from timestamp to  datetime.datetime?
