# 404 Errors when accessing the Ingress URL which is pointing to the External Service Domain Name

I'm trying to access a ingress URL which is  pointing to the backend External domain name service.
The External Domain the service is pointing to is the Network Load Balancer in AWS
When Im trying this way, Im getting 404 errors when curling the ingress domain name myexample.com but when I try to access the external domain name it works fine. It gives the intended results. Am I missing something here? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance
My manifest files are like below.
ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - host: myexample.com
    http:
      paths:
       - backend:
          serviceName: test-service
          servicePort: 80
    tls:
    - hosts:
        - myexample.com
      secretName: myexample-com-tls

svc.yaml
