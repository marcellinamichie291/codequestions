# Getting joint location(3D pose) w.r.t world of Kuka Iiwa arm in Drake

I have a Kuka Iiwa 7 arm in the scene and I am interested in getting the current(real-time) 3D coordinates of the arm joints w.r.t world (or w.r.t robot base). I am able to get the current joint 1 DOF positions(thetas) but not the exact 3D coordinate representing the position of the joint in some frame(world or base).
I tried adding Triad for each link and tried get_pose_in_world() method for RigidBody_[float] type object of the frame, but received an error that the method does not exist for RigidBody_[float] class.
Note: I am using PyDrake for the project.
What is the correct way to approach this problem?
Thanks,
Sarvesh
