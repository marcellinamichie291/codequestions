# How to create discrete color mapping via Plotly Hexbin

I have dataframe of latitude, longitude and Power. I am doing the binning with Plotly hexbin and getting the outcome like on the photo.

What i want is that, instead of continuous color mapping via "color_continuous_scale" of hexbins (like on the photo), i want to create discrete specific colors for specific power ranges. For instance from -140 to -100 red color, from -100 to -80 blue and from -80 to -40 green. I was trying "color_discrete_map" parameter but getting error while defining thresholds.
Here is the code:
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import plotly.express as px

fig = ff.create_hexbin_mapbox(
    data_frame=df, lat="latitude", lon="longitude",
    nx_hexagon=200, opacity=0.7, labels={"color": "Power"},
    color="Power", agg_func=np.mean, color_continuous_scale="HSV", range_color=[-140,-40],
    zoom = 9

)

fig.update_layout(mapbox_style="open-street-map")
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()
