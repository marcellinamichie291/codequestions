# How do I make it so that choosing a certain "directory" calls a function?

Beginner here, sorry--
You know how this shows up when you choose a directory in the terminal?

Is there a way I could create my own version of this, but when the user chooses one of the choices, it calls a function?
I don't need to be a directory but if the user says like
"options"
that menu pops up and it lists
"games" "text" "about"
can type
"open games"
void game()
{
    cout << "you are in game"
}

void text()
{
    cout << "you are in text"
}

void about()
{
    cout << "you are in about"

this is all i want it to do before int main() (for now, ofc)
how do i make it so that a certain input LISTS the different functions, and a certain input calls the different functions?
