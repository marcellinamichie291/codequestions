# Unable to install python version

My Ubuntu version in my vagrant is 14.04, and my python version is 2.7 which restricts me, is there a way I can update the python version to 3.10 (when I do it says: couldn't find any package by regex python 3.10) or get Ubuntu 20.04 on vagrant if it's impossible to get python 3.10 on Ubuntu 14.04
Tried:
Sudo apt-get install python3.10
Got: unable to locate package python3.10
