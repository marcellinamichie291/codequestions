# How to add oshi dependencies on java project in Eclipse?

I want to get my PC specs with a java program. I'm trying to make use of Oshi library to get this done but I am having problems implementing the dependencies on my project
I want to simply run this
SystemInfo systemInfo = new SystemInfo();
        HardwareAbstractionLayer hardware = systemInfo.getHardware();
        CentralProcessor processor = hardware.getProcessor();

        System.out.println(processor.toString());

but I'm getting this error:

I have added these dependencies from this link: https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.oshi/oshi-core/6.3.1/jar
Here is a picture of the Project Explorer

I'm pretty sure that I'm doing something wrong with the dependencies, maybe I am not getting the proper dependencies but I want to know what is happening or exactly which jars I need to add to get Oshi running on my java project
