# A dataset to exploit the different Variance Function Classes in R?

I am looking for a dataset which might be used to test the different variance functions in R. (Here you can find the reference: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/nlme/html/varClasses.html)
It is for an Applied Statistics course and we are covering the heteroschedastic models as topic.
The web is full of datasets but I cannot find a one with the required characterstics:
it should be a "longitudinal dataset" which means I should have repeated measures of different indicators(2 or 3), in different time instants, for the same subject. Of course it does not have to be a person but the "subject" can be a country, a company, a city.
The dataset should be similar to the "armd" which can be found in the library(nlmeU) in R.
Data from OECD, DataBank and have many missing values or the obtained p-values are not significant enough to justify the analysis.
Does someone have any suggested dataset which might fit the purpose?
Thanks in advance.
Data from OECD, DataBank and have many missing values or the obtained p-values are not significant enough to justify the analysis. I have searched on kaggle but all the datasets are for prediction, classification or machine learning. The datasets are usually not longitudinal.Same for zenodo and the other main data repositories.
