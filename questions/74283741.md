# How to build a app lock application using flutter

I am looking to create a application using flutter that  can put locks on  other apps according to users choice. So can anyone tell me how to do this using flutter ? Is there any plugins out there ?
The app must work like this "when someone opens a locked app it should show a lock screen before opening the app, if the password is correct the application will be opened else it should show the password is incorrect".
