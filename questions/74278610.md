# How to publish docusaurus website at username.github.io

I have been learning how to use Docusaurus to make markdown documentation websites recently.
My exact questions are:

How do I have to name the repository
What do I have to change in this config: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WAhY.png
What branch do I need for what?

My goal is to create a site at ruixey.github.io, not at ruixey.github.io/REPO_NAME/
Thanks in advance for any help
