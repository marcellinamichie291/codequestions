# SQL Server REGEX with multiples spaces white

I'm trying to solve this problem in SQL Server. I need to get the customer's name when in the line there is the following condition:
Start with any [letter]/[numbers][space][numbers][space]
I used [A-Z]/[0-9]%, but I can't consider the space and the sequence of numbers followed by the other space
Here's the line I'm working on:
K/31209536                          9997530556                         RICARDO JOSE DE OLIVEIRA QUEIROZ

When the condition is true, I need to get the name:
RICARDO JOSE DE OLIVEIRA QUEIROZ
