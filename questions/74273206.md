I am trying to run azure interactive mode but every time it displays these errors, any idea how to fix them?
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the prompt_toolkit.interface with pip install promp_toolkit, mounting it to another storage account through the Azure portal, installed the Azure CLI entirely from scratch on my machine locally but nothing seems to work. My Python version is 3.10 and all the Azure CLI versions are up to date. If anyone can help me resolve this problem it would be great, because I am new to Azure Powershell and interactive mode really helps me learn the new commands and how to write.
