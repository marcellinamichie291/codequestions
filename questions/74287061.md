# Could not communicate to Elasticsearch

I am trying to send my node app logs to fluentd to elasticsearch to kibana, but having a problem connecting fluentd with elasticsearch with docker. I want to dockerize this efk stack.
I have attached the folder structure and shared relevant files.
Following is the folder structure:

fluent.conf:
  @type forward
  port 24224
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>
<match *.**>
  @type copy
  <store>
    @type elasticsearch
    host elasticsearch
    port 9200
    user elastic
    password pass
  </store>
</match>```

**DockerFile**

```FROM fluent/fluentd:v1.15-1
USER root
RUN gem install elasticsearch -v 7.6.0
# RUN gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch -v 7.6.0
RUN gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch -v 4.1.1
RUN gem install fluent-plugin-rewrite-tag-filter
RUN gem install fluent-plugin-multi-format-parser
USER fluent```

**Docker-compose.yml**


```version: '3'
services:
  fluentd:
    build: ./fluentd
    container_name: loggingFluent
    volumes:
      - ./fluentd/conf:/fluentd/etc

Maybe I am missing some with docker networking because I am using docker for the first time I have checked the ports exposed by docker containers and they are fine. I have done this without docker and have used the same settings but having a problem doing it with docker. Looking forward to seeing your responces.Thank you very much.
