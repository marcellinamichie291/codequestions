# Can't Read/Write to flash drive using NodeJS on Raspberry PI

I've got my flash drive mounted and modified my /etc/fstab file to automatically mount the drive, and I can run commands from the CLI and read/write to the drive just fine.
As soon as I try any of the same commands using below methods within my node app (running from local storage), nothing is happening. No errors are thrown, nothing is written to/ read from the drive and the system acts like all is normal and just continues with the program:
childProcess.exec('ffmpeg -f alsa -ar 48000 -ac 1 -i plughw:1,0 -acodec flac /mnt/usb/recordings/test.flac');

var args = ['-f', 'alsa', '-ar', '48000', '-ac', 1, '-i', 'plughw:1,0', '-acodec', 'flac', '/mnt/usb/recordings/test.flac'];
recorder = childProcess.spawn('ffmpeg', args);

Are there any other steps necessary to allow nodejs to access the flash drive?
