I have three projects: market-1, market-2, market-3 
My goal is to create a super admin panel that has: jobs, controllers, models and etc.
What is the best way to structure their folders?
My thoughts:
-app/
 --Controllers/
 ----Market-1/
 ------FirstController.php
 ------SecondController.php
 ----Market-2/
 ------FirstController.php
 ------SecondController.php
 ----Market-3/
 ------FirstController.php
 ------SecondController.php
 --Models
 ----Market-1/
 ------FirstModel.php
 ------SecondModel.php
 ----Market-2/
 ------FirstModel.php
 ------SecondModel.php
 ----Market-3/
 ------FirstModel.php
 ------SecondModel.php
 --Jobs
 ----Market-1/
 ------Job.php
 ------Job.php
 ----Market-2/
 ------Job.php
 ------Job.php
 ----Market-3/
 ------Job.php
 ------Job.php

 -routes/
 ---market1.php
 ---market2.php
 ---market3.php

I will be happy to see any examples
