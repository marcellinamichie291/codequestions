# Flask raises TemplateNotFound error even though template file exists

I am trying to render the file home.html.  The file exists in my project, but I keep getting jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: home.html when I try to render it.  Why can't Flask find my template?
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

/myproject
    app.py
    home.html
