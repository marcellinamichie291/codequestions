# How do I catch a 404 response and use it to control program flow?

I have access to two APIs. The first (and better API) responds with 404 for certain types of input. If the first API responds with 404 I want to send a request to the second API.
The log shows this after a 404:
{
insertId: "0987654321"
labels: {2}
logName: "projects/my-awesome-project/logs/cloudfunctions.googleapis.com%2Fcloud-functions"
receiveTimestamp: "2022-11-01T21:41:50.570143002Z"
resource: {2}
textPayload: "Exception from a finished function: HTTPError: Response code 404 (NOT FOUND)"
timestamp: "2022-11-01T21:41:50.251844Z"
trace: "projects/my-awesome-project/traces/1234567890"
}

I'm guessing that the code will look something like this:
try {
  async function callFirstAPI() {
    const response = await got(url, options).json();
    // if successful do stuff with the data
  }
} catch (error) {
  if (error.textPayload.includes('404') {
    callBackupAPI();
  }
}

What doesn't work is this. Nothing logs when the API throws a 404.
try {
  async function callFirstAPI() {
    const response = await got(url, options).json();
    console.log(response); // nothing logs
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error!!! " + error); // nothing logs
}
