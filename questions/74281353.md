# Issues with installation of npgsql version 4.0.10.0

I was able to install npgsql successfull. I have also verified by looking at control-panel and i see the npgsql 4.0.10. However, when I run the "factoryclasses" command in PowerShell, I am not able to see the npgsql connector. I am doing the installation on the AWS server and i am using 4.0.10 version as that's the version which is recommended by the Microsoft team to connect with Power-Bi.
[System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactories]::GetFactoryClasses()
When i run the factoryclasses command, I expect to see npgsql.
