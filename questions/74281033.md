# StandardScalar instead of normalize in parameter_grid

I'm trying to pass normalize in parameter search to pass it to GridSearchCV.
I'm getting a warning that normalize is depreciated and that I should use StandardScalar instead.
I can't just add StandardScalar to the pipeline because that would apply it all the time when I want it to be applied once and not applied the second time.
This is my code:
        'params': {
        'normalize': [True, False]
        }

How can I use StandardScalar here instead of normalize?
