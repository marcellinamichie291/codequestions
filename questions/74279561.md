# Boot sector linked with ld has QEMU print "Hard Disk Boot Failed: not a bootable disk"

A few friends and I are working on a very simple kernel project.  ATM, we have a bootloader (using GNU assembly) and a simple kernel (C with no stdlib).  I've been tasked with setting up a QEMU simulation to test the os, but ran into several issues along the way.
I've gotten QEMU to boot, and I have created a bootable disk image.
Makefile:
%.o: %.S
    as -o $@ -c $<

bootsect: boot.o
    ld -o ./bin/bootsect.bin $^ -nostdlib -Ttext 0x7C00

img: bootsect
    dd if=/dev/zero of=boot.img bs=512 count=2880
    dd if=./bin/bootsect.bin of=boot.iso conv=notrunc bs=512 count=1

I tried to run it with qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=boot.img
I have also tried various ways of booting the image, but always end up with the same error:
Booting from Hard Disk:
     Boot failed: not a bootable disk

Here is the boot loader code if needed:
.code16
.org 0

.text

.global _start
_start:
    cli

    xor  %ax, %ax
    movw %ax, %es
    movw %ax, %ds
    movw %ax, %es
    movw %ax, %ss

    movw $0x3000, %sp

    sti

    movw $hello, %si
    call print

print:
    xorb %bh, %bh
    movb $0x0E, %ah

    lodsb

    cmpb $0, %al
    je 1f

    int $0x10;
    jmp print

1:
    ret

hello:
    .asciz "HELLO WORLD\n"

.org 510
.word 0xAA55

Where is the problem?
