# How do I transpose observations into variables/columns?

I've got a data frame that looks something like this:
precinct, race, age, people
1001, black, 18-40, 1
1001, white, 18-40, 2
1001, hispanic, 18-40, 3
1001, asian, 18-40, 4
1001, black, 40 or older, 5
1001, white, 40 or older, 6
1001, hispanic, 40 or older, 7
1001, asian, 40 or older, 8

I want to make it look like this:
precinct, black, white, hispanic, asian, 18-40, 40 or older
1001, 6, 8, 10, 12, 10, 26

I've used dcast
dcast(
  data = mydataframe,
  formula = Precinct ~ race + age,
  fun.aggregate = sum,
  value.var = 'people'
)

but this does not produce my desired result.
