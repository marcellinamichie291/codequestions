I have a txt file like this:
text='{"id": "a364ebd4", "reason": "delay", "description": "I bought a tv. Its not working and the manager said it was "the best" "}'
How do I remove the quotation marks on "the best" without changing the rest of the string?
To this:
text='{"id": "a364ebd4", "reason": "delay", "description": "I bought a tv. Its not working and the manager said it was the best"}'
I tried re.sub(""", '', text) but then the other quotation marks disappear too and I want to keep them.
