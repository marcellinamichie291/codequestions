# Downloading video from AWS S3 using Cognito identity pool for authentication - Access denied

I would like to download a video file from AWS S3 using Cognito identity pool for authentication. I created a identity pool role in AWS and added it to my code. Unfortunately I get the error 403 (access denied).
My code looks like this:
CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider(
            activity,
            "eu-xxxxxx-x:xxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xx-xxxx", 
            Regions.EU_XXXXXX_X // Region
    );

    s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(credentialsProvider, RegionUtils.getRegion("eu-xxxxxx-x"));
TransferUtility transferUtility =
            TransferUtility.builder()
                    .context(activity)
                    .s3Client(s3Client)
                    .build();
    TransferNetworkLossHandler.getInstance(activity);
    TransferObserver downloadObserver =
            transferUtility.download(BUCKETNAME,
                    "videos/example.mp4",
                    new File(activity.getFilesDir(), "example.mp4"));

Do you have any idea what configuration is required on AWS to make a download possible?
