# Google Appscript change date format and currency

did you know how to change the date format from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY/MM/DD and currency format ?
because I already did change the date format to YYYY/MM/DD and currency to  ₩1,000 in spreadsheet, but after running the AppScript and generate to doc, the data won't change, it still same as default DD/MM/YYYY and for the currency just show ordinary number (ex : 1250000 it should be like this  ₩1,250,000)
this case I make Auto Fill Google Doc Template from Google Sheets Data Using Google Apps Script.
const friendlyDate = new Date(row[7]).toLocaleDateString();
    

I expecting format YYYY/MM/DD and the currency format.
