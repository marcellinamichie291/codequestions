# Not sure why "Element div is not closed" won't go away

Admittedly, I'm new to coding so I'm sure there may be many issues in my code. The errors that are showing up right now are all Element div is not closed. If someone can please help me resolve this, it would be greatly appreciated, thank you. My code is listed below:


.instagramlogo {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  left: 20px;
  top: 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.linkedinlogo {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  left: 100px;
  top: 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
<body>
  <!-- banner, navigation bar, logos which hyperlink to my socials -->
  <div class="banner">
    <div class="navbar">

As I stated, I am a noob with coding as I have tried to mess around with the arrangement of my divs and added+ and removed but my attempts have failed miserably. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!
