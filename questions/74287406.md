# Megaparsec: transforming comment syntax into a Record

Using Megaparsec, if I want to parse a string containing comments of the form ~{content} into a Comment record, how would I go about doing that? For instance:
data Comment = { id :: Integer, content :: String }

parse :: Parser [Comment]
parse = _

parse
  "hello world ~{1-sometext} bla bla ~{2-another comment}" 
  == [Comment { id = 1, content = "sometext" }, Comment { id = 2, content = "another comment"}]

The thing I'm stuck on is allowing for everything that's not ~{} to be ignored, including the lone char ~ and the lone brackets {}.
