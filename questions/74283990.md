# blob text file download does not work. It just opens blob page how can I fix this?

Hello I developed some program with blob download.
Here is my code
function download_ticks() {
    var downloadButton = document.getElementById("downloadAnchor");
    var fileName = document.getElementById("downloadInput").value;
    var myFile = new Blob([get_ticks()], {type: 'text/plain' });
    window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;
    downloadButton.setAttribute("download", fileName);
    downloadButton.setAttribute("href", window.URL.createObjectURL(myFile));
    downloadButton.click();
}

I am having some problem that I can not download blob file with the code, it just goes to the blob page and does not proceed any downloads
It opens page like this:
blob:https://website.com/f1282025-5462-484b-ade3-ec615ae13162
are there anyways to fix this problem?
