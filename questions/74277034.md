# BouncyCastle gets error 'public key presented not for certificate signature'

I am reading EC public key from HSM using PKCS11Interop, passing it to BouncyCastle and trying to create a X509Certificate.
While checking its validity i got this error: UnManagedException: Public key presented not for certificate signature. This is the part of code from which Error raises:
X509Certificate rootCertificate = new X509Certificate (
        new X509CertificateStructure (TBS_Structure, AlgorithmID, new BitDERString(signature));
rootCertificate.Verify(PublicKeyParam);

PublicKeyParam is RSAKeyParameter and rebuilt based on Exponent and Modolus extracted from the library which made key on HSM (and returned key parameters). rootCertificate's algorithm is SHA256WithRSAandMGF1.
