Write a C program that accepts a positive integer n and compute for the product of sums from 1 to n using a for loop and after the computation, output the product of sums. The program does not accept an input n that is not positive.
Hint: if input n=5 then prodOfSums = (1+1) x (2+2) x (3+3) x (4+4) x (5+5) = 3840
