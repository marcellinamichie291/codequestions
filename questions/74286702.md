# Website shows one time use key when visited

I have a simple login system with ads so I can make some money.
I want a website that when I visit it shows a key,
but it only shows this key once so that people don't get keys that already have been used.
For example: User1 opens website https://example.com/ and he gets a key.
He can use the key on my application and when User2 opens the website he gets a key that has never been given to anyone else.
