# Retrieve all collection from document from Firestore

I'm trying to retrieve all albums from artist, but i can't do this.
I've got a structure in the Cloud Firestore:
Artists -> Artist Name -> Albums of Artist Name -> Songs.
I've received all songs from album by the code:
Future getDocId() async {
     await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('artist').get().then(
          (snapshot) => snapshot.docs.forEach((document) {
            FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection("artist")
            .doc("Artist1").collection("ArtistsAlbum").get().then((value){
                  value.docs.forEach((element) {
                     docIDs.add(element.id);
                  },
                  );
                  setState(() {});
            });
          }),
        );

Code like
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('artist').doc("Rammstein").get();

Doesn't work.
Is it possible to receive that data? Or i need to remade my structure like:
Artist1>Albums->Songs
Artist2->Albums->Songs
