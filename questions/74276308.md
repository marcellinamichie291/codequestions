# OAuth2 Authorization grant flow not refreshing expired access/ID tokens - Spring Security

When a user's access and ID tokens expire, they should be considered invalid and refreshed using the refresh token. If unable to do so, the user's session should be expired.  *(stating from the issue itself) *
Issue Reference - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/6814
Question -
Any leads on how to customise this for now?
