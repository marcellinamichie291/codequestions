# Does Google oauth not support Google Maps?

first, I'm not good at English. I'm sorry.
I want to get Google maps information of the user through Google Oauth.
ex) Users Paths searched, places left as markers
However, the api could not be found in the oauth 2.0 scope.
(https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)
Is that a possible scenario?

I looked up https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes.

I looked for https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation, but I couldn't find the results I wanted.
