# How to convert a NUMERIC field into a DATE field and use it in a WHERE clause in DB2?

I have a field that is integer format 20220801 that needs to be converted to a date field. I then need to use this field in a WHERE clause compared against the CURRENT DATE. This is specifically for DB2.
Every time I try to do this I receive this error message:

Here are some snippets I've tried unsuccessfully, each time returning the above error
SELECT
    DATE(TIMESTAMP_FORMAT(CHAR(BWDUED), 'YYYYMMDD')) AS DUE_DATE,
    CURRENT DATE AS TODAY_DATE
FROM
    SCHEMA.TABLE
WHERE
    DATE(TIMESTAMP_FORMAT(CHAR(BWDUED), 'YYYYMMDD')) = CURRENT_DATE

SELECT
    DATE(TO_DATE(CHAR(BWDUED), 'YYYYMMDD')) AS DUE_DATE,
    CURRENT DATE AS TODAY_DATE
FROM
    SCHEMA.TABLE
WHERE
    DATE(TO_DATE(CHAR(BWDUED), 'YYYYMMDD')) = CURRENT_DATE

I've looked at many of the answers on here, but none of them have gotten me past this error. Any help on navigating this would be appreciated!
