# How do I combine all of these crypto address balance functions?



Initially I have 3 python files and csv files which contains different
functions to get different crypto balances, mainly BTC, ETH and Terra
Luna.
However, I would like to compile them into one python file and csv.
I would like to know how do I combine all these functions and run it in the asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()?


from web3 import Web3
from web3.eth import AsyncEth
from terra_sdk.client.lcd import AsyncLCDClient
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import time
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv('compiled.csv') #Reading csv file which contains BTC,ETH and Terra Luna addresses.
alchemy_url = "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/insertAlchemyKey"
w3 = Web3(Web3.AsyncHTTPProvider(alchemy_url), modules={'eth': (AsyncEth,)}, middlewares=[])
Wallet_Address=(df.loc[:,'Address']) #Address header in the csv file
results = []

def get_tasks(session):
    tasks = []
    for address in Wallet_Address:
        url = f"https://bitcoinexplorer.org/api/address/{address}"
        tasks.append(session.get(url,ssl=False))
        print(address)
    return tasks

session_timeout = aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=None)

async def get_btcbalances():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=session_timeout) as session:
       tasks = get_tasks(session)
       responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks) 
       for response in responses:
        results.append(await response.json())

async def get_ethbalances():
    for address in Wallet_Address:
        balance = await w3.eth.get_balance(address)
        print(address, balance)

async def get_terralunabalances():
    async with AsyncLCDClient("http://lcd.terra.dev", "phoenix-1") as terra:
        for address in Wallet_Address:
            balances = await terra.bank.balance(address)
            print(balances)

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(idk what to put here)
