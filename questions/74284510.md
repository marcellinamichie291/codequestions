# What is the correct way to call a function within a python class?

I am building a very basic script for trouble shooting issues we run in into at the noc.
I am trying to call functions within a class.  i commented out what I am trying to accomplish on each line.
Essentially I want to be able to call the main function after each print statment here
'''
def telenium():
        print('Telenium Procedure\n')
        print('1) Copy the name of the site.')
        print('2) Open Telenium.') 
        print('3) Click on the Admin drop down.')
        print('4) Hit the DBM - Start new DBM option.')
        print('5) Search the name of the site in the Match query.')
        print('6) Anything other then green indicated error.')
        # main()  should bring up main function after print statments

    def solar_winds():
        print('Solar Winds Troubleshooting')
        # main() should bring up main function after print statments

    def netcool():
        print('NetPoller Tickets')
        # main() should bring up main function after print statments

    def scada():
        print('TSCADA, SCADA Troublshooting')
        # main() should bring up main function after print statments

    def png_tickets():
        print('PNG Tickets')
        # main() should bring up main function after print statments

the second issue is i would like to call the following functions within my if else loop here
'''
def main():
        user_input = ''

        user_input = input(
            'Choose from the following: 1) Telenium | 2) Solar Winds | 3) Netcool | 4) SCADA | 5) PNG Tickets | 6) Exit program \n')

        if user_input == '1':
            print('tele')
            telenium() # should call telenium funciton
        elif user_input == '2':
            print('SW')
            solorwinds() # should call solarwinds functoin
        elif user_input == '3':
            print('netcool')
            netcool() # should call netcool function
        elif user_input == '4':
            print('scada')
            scada()  # should call scada funciton
        elif user_input == '5':
            print('PNG')
            png_tickets()  # should call png_tickets function
        elif user_input == '6':
            exit  # should exit program
        else:
            print('sorry, not a valid option, head back to basic')
            #main  should run if else loop again if non of the conditions are met'''

I cant figure out what im doing wrong and I spent some time googling it but still cant find out why its not working. I faintly remember calling functions like this in ruby but im unsure how to do it in python3.
below is the complete code with the hashed out intentions included. thanks for your help !
