# UDP traffic distribution between ports on the same server

I've got a UDP server in GO (AWS EC2) which sends out huge traffic, it has very high Send-Q, packets being delayed and lost due to the network bandwidth. Does this make sense to distribute the load between N ports on the same machine by running separate UDP servers within their own goroutines, and why?
Is network bandwidth shared among all ports on the network card? What about EC2 ?
