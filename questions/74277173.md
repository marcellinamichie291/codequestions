# Is there a way of retrieving data from a Google Cloud Database from MATLAB programmatically?

I am creating a standalone MATLAB application which is going to be distributed to 2 different users. I would like each instance of my application to connect to Google Cloud Database (MySQL), retrieve some data, manipulate it in the user's local computer and then send the data back to be stored in Google Cloud Database.
Is there way of connecting MATLAB directly to Google Cloud Database programmatically? (e.g. WITHOUT exporting a .csv file from the database manually first)
Thanks for any help.
Obviously, I tried exporting the data manually as a .csv file and it works. Just looking for a way of automating this process from within MATLAB. Therefore, previous answers regarding the method of exporting a CSV first does not apply to me.
