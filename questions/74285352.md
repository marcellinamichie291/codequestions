# How to get an instance name and a file path of a child unloaded document in a CATIA Product via CATIA API?

We try to get the "Link to Reference" properties (the CATIA Part/Product file path) and the Instance name property via CATIA VBA API when this CATIA Part/Product is not loaded in the CATIA (it is a broken link)

When this child CATIA Part/CATIA Product object is loaded we can easily do it in the following way:
Set cad = catia.ActiveDocument
Set childProds = cad.product.Products
     
Dim childProd As product
Set childProd = childProds.Item(1)
  
Dim instanceName As String
Dim filePath As String
instanceName = childProd.name
filePath = childProd.ReferenceProduct.Parent.fullName

or with the CAIEngine API:
Dim catEngine As StiEngine
Set catEngine = catia.GetItem("CAIEngine")
    
Dim product As ProductDocument
Set product = GetActiveProductDocument()
    
Dim rootItem As StiDBItem
Set rootItem = catEngine.GetStiDBItemFromAnyObject(product)
    
Dim childs As StiDBChildren
Set childs = rootItem.GetChildren
    
Dim curChild As StiDBItem
Set curChild = childs.Item(1)
                        
Dim filePath As String
filePath = curChild.GetDocumentFullPath()
           
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = curChild.GetDocument()
        
Dim refProd As product
Set refProd = obj.product.ReferenceProduct
    
Dim instanceName As String
    
Set cad = catia.ActiveDocument
Set childProds = cad.product.Products
Dim childProd As product
For i = 1 To childProds.count
    Set childProd = childProds.Item(i)
    If (childProd.ReferenceProduct Is refProd) Then
        instanceName = childProd.name
        Exit For
    End If
Next i

But when this child CATIA Part/CATIA Product object is NOT loaded:

In the first approach the childProd.ReferenceProduct property doesn't work;
In the second appoach the curChild.GetDocument() method doesn't work.
