# How to set first row height of DataGridView in Designer

I try to control columns in Designer and to change the height of all rows in either Designer or Code. The following code and settings change the height of all rows but the first one like the image.
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Text = dataGridView1.Rows[0].Height.ToString(); // always 33

    // in Designer
    // RowTemplate.Height = 50
    // AutoSizeRowsMode = none
}


After I fill the first row cell 50-height rows are created. Runtime code doesn't make any difference. To fix it I have to code dataGridView1.Rows[0].Height = 50 after the grid has been painted. Why this and how to implement that in Designer level?
