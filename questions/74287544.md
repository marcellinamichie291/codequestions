# Recreating matching pennies game

I am trying to replicate a script that replicates the followng function

I am quite new to python and I am quite lost as to how to proceed. How do I go about setting up a game that asks for a user input and repeats 5 rounds

This is all I have gotten and I am very lost. Any help would really be appreciated
