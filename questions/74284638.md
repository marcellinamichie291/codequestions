# Is there any way to enable Vulkan rendering for all Chromium-based processes by default?

E.g. Chrome, Electron apps, etc. Without setting it, I get graphical glitches on my Linux machine - but it's very tedious to set manually and make custom shortcuts etc. Is there any way to accomplish this by an environmental variable or something else clever?
The arguments that need to be added to each application are normally as follows, but I'm hoping there's some more global method I've overlooked: --use-vulkan --enable-features=Vulkan
