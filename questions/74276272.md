# Loop through a list with itertools.islice

I'm trying to check the first 5 elements in a list, see if two or more are greater or equal to 5, and then check the next 5 elements with the same process.
I have this working by creating a new list and appending the next 5 elements:
from itertools import islice

myList = [3, 7, 3, 1, 2, 3, 6, 75, 77, 4]
print(sum(i>5 for i in islice(myList, 5)) >= 2)
newlist = myList[5:]
print(sum(i>5 for i in islice(newlist, 5)) >= 2)

Is there a way to loop through the original list, checking 5 elements at a time without creating a new list?
Thanks in advance.
