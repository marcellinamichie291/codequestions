# Create bd in android - flutter

I was trying to create a local DB but I'm having some problems, this is my code
Future<Future<Database>> createTable() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final database = openDatabase(
    join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'doggie_database.db'),
    onCreate: (db, version) {
      return db.execute(
        'CREATE TABLE dogs(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, ref TEXT, descricao TEXT, name TEXT, price DOUBLE, quantity DOUBLE, image TEXT, cor TEXT, tamanho TEXT, priceWithoutTax DOUBLE)',
      );
    },
    version: 1,
  );
  return database;
}

Future<void> insertDog(Dog dog) async {
  var db = await createTable();

  await db.insert(
    'dogs',
    dog.toMap(),
    conflictAlgorithm: ConflictAlgorithm.replace,
  );
}

that is, I'm creating the DB when I call the insertDog. At first I tried to create the DB in main but then I couldn't call the "database" . So I decided this way, now I can't continue because "await db.insert" is giving error.
erro:"The method 'insert' isn't defined for the type 'Future'.
Try correcting the name to the name of an existing method, or defining a method named 'insert'."
I don't know if there is a solution to this problem or if anyone has another suggestion.
thanks
