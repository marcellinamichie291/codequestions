# IP address configuration (kathara)

When you configurate some interface for a device using 'ifconfig eth0 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx up' what's the difference bettween using IP like '192.168.0.2' and '192.168.0.2/30'.
I understand the idea of a submask and that it's good use for redirect datagrams only taking part of the IP address but I dont get why using it when assinging the IP for some interface.
