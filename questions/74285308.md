# Query.prototype.exec() function execute multiple times

I am trying to add some logic to every route in the Express, application. I am using mongoose for database operation. For that reason, I want to add little logic on Query.prototype.exec()
function along with its default behavior. For test reasons, I add a console.log() to check whether it's working perfectly or not. During the check, I saw my exec() function called multiple times instead of once. I am not aware of this situation. Is this a default behavior or something else I am missing?
My Codes: file.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// patching Query.prototype.exec
const exec = mongoose.Query.prototype.exec;

mongoose.Query.prototype.exec = function(){
    console.log("I am called")
    return exec.apply(this,arguments)
}

app.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require("path")
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const morgan = require('morgan');
require('dotenv/config');
const api = process.env.API_URL;
const cors = require('cors');


app.use(cors());

app.use(getUser);
require('./startup/routes')(app);

// my file.js used here
require('./services/file');

require('./startup/db')();

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server is running 3000");
    console.log(api);
});

my terminal output
[nodemon] 2.0.7

Can anyone help me to understand why is this happening and how am I supposed to call the function only once every time?
