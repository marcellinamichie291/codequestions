# Android Studio can't get FlowingDrawer to work

I was following this tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTyv65pDb58&list=PL5QTSps9slAZuJNYtg-A44-c4k3J6unGm&index=3
but when i import the flowing drawer to my cradle with this line
implementation 'com.mxn.soul:flowingdrawer-core:2.1.0'

it doesn't work, it seems to not be able to read the com.mxn and because of this the flowing drawer doesn't appear on either the java or xml files
i searched everywhere and i couldn't find why the cradle can't implement from android.mxn
