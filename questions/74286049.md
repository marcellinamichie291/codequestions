I created a CNN model with a soft and hard attention mechanism for the classification of breast cancer images, and the accuracy as follows:
Hard Attention = 99.2%
Soft Attention = 99.80%
Also, I created the pre-trainer VGG16 model with the soft and hard attention mechanism. The accuracy appeared as follows:
Hard Attention = 99.80%
Soft Attention = 99.2%
Is it normal for the results of the two models to appear with this convergence?
