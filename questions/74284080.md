# Should B+Trees with variable length keys and values be split based on size (bytes)?

I am trying to learn and implement a B+Tree for physical storage that supports variable length keys and values. It is to my understanding that you want to reduce the number of disk reads, so it makes sense to me to split a node when it's size (in bytes) overflows the page size (or the optimal read write size). However, is this still a good practice when only a single key can fit into a node, or is it better to start utilizing overflow pages/pointers when keys reach larger sizes to increase fanout? Do nodes need a minimum number of children for better performance?
