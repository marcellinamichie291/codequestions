# QML file in application cannot detect touch but only works with mouse clicks

I've been looking everywhere online but cannot find a working solution. When the application is used on a Desktop computer or laptop, it works fine. Mouse clicks are working, it's when we try with a device with a touch screen like surface pro, that's when problems appear.
I have tried adding to the cpp file that calls the QQuickwidget the flag responsible for detecting touch events and it works with some buttons but other widgets or items are not responding.
    AppName *AppName::createInstance(QWidget *parent)
{
    instanceUsageCounter++;
    if (instance == nullptr)
    {
        ui = new Ui::AppName();
        instance = new AppName();
        ui->setupUi(parent);
        ui->dc_stackWidget->setCurrentIndex(0);
        ui->widget_qml->setAttribute(Qt::WA_AcceptTouchEvents);
        QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_SynthesizeMouseForUnhandledTouchEvents);
    }
    return instance;
}

Comboboxes for example.
What exactly needs to be added to make the app detect both mouse clicks and touch events and wokr properly? What exactly is missing?
