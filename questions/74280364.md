# Mojolicious and ORM

I am looking for some best practices to use ORM with Mojolicious.
I am using the latest version (9.48) and see here some DB abstracts, but I would like to have something much more powerful, like DBx::Class or so.
Catalyst has ORM on a board, which is very useful, and, as Mojolicious is a very powerful framework too, I hope there is a way (or a few) how to use ORM with it.
Can you show some abstract examples, please?
Thank you!
