# How to get server side javascript function created in MongoDB

I have created one function using MongoDB shell but I am unable to use this function and also don't know how to get the function definition to edit or check.
db.system.js.insertOne({ _id : "getSessions" , value : function (clientid){    //some code  }})

and I used db.eval(getSessions(1)) for call this function but facing error ReferenceError: getSessions is not defined
Please help me for call this function and also I want to get function definition from MongoDb Shell.
