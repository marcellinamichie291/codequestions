# React Native AWS amplify: amplify configure -> permission denied

hi guys~ i'm using react native and try to connect to aws amplify, but since i follow the instruction of the aws amplify docs:
https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/react-native/#option-1-watch-the-video-guide
but I  got this error every time i enter a command in my terminal. I try to search if there's anyone got the same problem, instead there's not much informations online, does anyone know what's going on with this problem. Big thanks~
here's the error i got from the terminal

I tried to build a new project and connect aws amplify again, but the error still show up.
