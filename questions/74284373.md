I want to order my data as this, where it will order the date by one year
|Date       | Sales    | Group|
|-----------| -------- | -----|
|2022-11-02 | xxxxxxxx | A    |
|2021-11-03 | xxxxxx   | A    |
|2022-11-03 | xxxxxx   | A    |
|2021-11-04 | xxxxxx   | A    |
|2022-11-03 | xxxxxx   | B    |
|2021-11-04 | xxxxxx   | B    |
(because they have 52 weeks of interval)
Is there a possible way to do it?
I want to avoid join!
Sorry just to make it clear, I need to make sure that the the first row['date'] and second row['date'] has exactly 52 weeks of interval
i.e. date_sub(second_row['date'],interval 52 week) == first row['date']
Really sorry for the confusing
