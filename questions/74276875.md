# Unity mobile Multiple touches

I have a mobile game that detects where the player is pressing on the screen for the character to move accordingly, if the player puts another finger anywhere else... in my case the jump button the character stops moving, I suspect this is because my code detects multiple touches and does not know how to handle it, I tried a few things but nothing worked for me, any ideas how to code a way so that if at least one touch is in the area I want it will keep moving and will not be disturbed by other touches? Thanks in advance!!
private void Start()
    {
        screenWidth = Screen.width;
        screenHeight = Screen.height;
    }

private void Update()
        int i = 0;
        while (i < Input.touchCount)
        {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(i);

                positionX = touch.position.x;
                positionY = touch.position.y;
                if (touch.position.x < screenWidth / 6 && touch.position.y < screenHeight /2)
                {
                    PlayerController.StopMoving();
                    PlayerController.MoveLeft();
                }
                else if (touch.position.x > screenWidth / 6 && touch.position.x < screenWidth / 2 && touch.position.y < screenHeight /2) 
                {
                    PlayerController.StopMoving();
                    PlayerController.MoveRight();
                } else
                {
                    PlayerController.StopMoving();
                }
            ++i;
        } if (Input.touchCount == 0)
        {
            PlayerController.StopMoving();
        }

Player controller is a seperate script responsible for the movements, this script is the one that activates those movements
This is what my game looks like, Though it might help, the move buttons are only UI while the jump and shoot are actual buttons
