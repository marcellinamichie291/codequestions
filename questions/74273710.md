# subclass PyQt5.QtCore.QObject, but signal not recved

first, let me show my code.
in main.py:
self.sample_th = sample_thread()
self.sample_th.data_sampled.connect(self.audio_buffer.handle_new_data)
self.sample_th.start()

in audio_buffer.py:
import PyQt5.QtCore as qtc
    
class audio_buffer(qtc.QObject):
    data_available = qtc.pyqtSignal(np.ndarray)
         
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = RingBuffer()

    def handle_new_data(self, data):
        print(data[0])

to be short, i have two files: main.py and audio_buffer.py,
and the programm could run.
the wired thing (i think) is:
if i subclass PyQt5.QtCore.QObject, nothing printed;
if i change class audio_buffer as below,
class audio_buffer():

the data can print out.
i don't know why this happend.
can anyone help?
BTW, if any mistake or bug in my written english, pls tell.
THANKS.
i have googled much, but i found nothing help so far, maily because of my not good english...
