# Why isnt SSS equal with SSS?(Unreal Engine 5)

My question is that I put it in Unreal 5.0.3 so that if a variable (actor type) is equal to SSS (an actor), it should do something and it doesn't want to work.
Since I've been looking for a solution for 3 days and couldn't find one, out of curiosity I wrote out the value of the variable with it and it returned the SSS.
Can someone please help me because I don't understand why SSS is not equal to SSS.view image here
