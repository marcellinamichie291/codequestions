Hi I want to find captcha in some website to make it in a sence that it work on all website I have i come up with an idea to  use reges. so I used a regex in such a way if there is no captcha word found in html parser print captcha not found. below is the code.
library python, beautifulsoup,requests
url_protocols = ['http://', 'https://']
urls = ['google.com','wix.com']

for url in urls:
    for url_protocol in url_protocols:
        try:
            full_https_url = url_protocol + url
            res = requests.get(full_https_url, timeout=5)
            soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')
            #elems = soup.select('body')
            m = re.findall(r'(?i)captcha' , soup)
            if m:
              print(f'captcha found::: {full_https_url}')
              continue
            else:
              print('captcha not found')
              #store it in a database
        except:
          continue
