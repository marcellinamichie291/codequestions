How to restore the original array of a two-dimensional array, which is saved as a csv with Pandas and then read into a string


print(data_target_test['texts'][1])
print(type(data_target_test['labels'][1]))
data_target_test.to_csv('test.csv')
data_target_test_2 = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
a = data_target_test_2['texts'][1]

I have tried string processing, but it is too complex and time-consuming. The number of spaces in front of each number is different. I hope to get this array quickly
