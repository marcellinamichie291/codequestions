# IAM Role (arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/demo) cannot be assumed

I have created an assume role 2 months back in a dev account and update my root user in trust relationship . Terraform was working fine with that configuration
Now I have done the same thing , but while running terraform plan , am getting this error ,

Error: operation error STS: AssumeRole, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: c0e2ae10-cbaf-44b3-9ecc-16e180405088, api error AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::xxxxxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/demo/aws-go-sdk-1667304405742939100 is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/demo

I dont know whats the reason , the roles and trust relationship were exactly same , but may I know whats the reason for this error?
