# CSS_Stroke to text

Are there any ways in CSS to give stroke to text (not in SVG) with different colors?
I've tried this option, but seems that when one change font size to 1em or smaller, stroke "eat" all figure line, see example below


p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 1em;
  -webkit-text-stroke-width: 3px;
  -webkit-text-stroke-color: #ff0000; /* Can be changed in the live sample */
}
<p>Text with stroke</p>
<input type="color" value="#ff0000" />
