# How to add space / rests to a Pattern with ToneJS?

I'm trying to find a way to add spaces/rests to a sequence of notes with ToneJS.
I've created an example on Stackblitz.
I'm currently trying to use a Tone.Pattern to loop over the notes and use triggerAttackRelease to play the note, but there seems to be no way of adding a rest / space between the sequenced notes (without note crashing, see Stackblitz example).
I.e.
// =======================
// EXAMPLE 1
const arrayOfNotesWithoutDelays = [
  { note: 'A3', duration: 0.33, delay: 0, velocity: 0.7 },
  { note: 'C4', duration: 0.33, delay: 1, velocity: 1 },
  { note: 'E4', duration: 0.33, delay: 0, velocity: 0.5 },
  { note: 'G4', duration: 0.33, delay: 0, velocity: 0.8 },
];

const pattern = new Tone.Pattern(
  (time, { note, duration, delay, velocity }) => {
    // When there is a delay, it will crash the audio scheduling...
    synth.triggerAttackRelease(note, duration, time + delay, velocity);
  },
  arrayOfNotesWithoutDelays,
  'up'
);

It's possible I'm going about this in the wrong way, but I can't currently find any information on how to create rests between notes with ToneJS. Any help/advice would be great!
