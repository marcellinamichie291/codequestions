# Gatsby MDX Graph QL Queries not displaying my posts?

So it's been a while since I updated my Gatsby blog site, over 2 years and now when I updated all the packages, I noticed the markdown options have changed.
Orginally when I used this code, it would show all my blog post accurately with the correct images etc.
          export const query = graphql`
            {
              allMdx(
                filter: { fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/posts/" } }
                sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
                limit: 6
              ) {
                nodes {
                  frontmatter {
                    alt
                    title
                    path
                    slug
                    date(formatString: "MMMM Do, YYYY")
                    image {
                      childImageSharp {
                        fluid {
                          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          `

However, now I tried to choose the options based on what I found from graphql that looks similar to my previous options
Here's the new updated code
          export const query = graphql`
            {
              allMdx(
                filter: { body: { regex: "/posts/" } }
                sort: { order: DESC, fields: frontmatter___date }
                limit: 6
              ) {
                nodes {
                  frontmatter {
                    alt
                    title
                    path
                    slug
                    date(formatString: "MMMM Do, YYYY")
                    image {
                      childImageSharp {
                        gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
                      }
                    }
                  }
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          `

However, this code only displays 2 post on my home page and doesn't show any of the images when I need all 6 to display and showcase all the images.
When I run the queries in graphql it only displays the 2 blog post data so I don't know which option to choose to reshow the same things I had before I updated my site with the new versions of gatsby
