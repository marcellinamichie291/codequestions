# Blazor File Upload - way too slow

I created a new Blazor Web Assembly App with Core Hosted, and implemented a file upload as described in:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/file-uploads?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=webassembly
The Upload itsself is working, but its unusable slow. I picked a 2 KB File and it took 50 seconds for the request to arrive at the server. With everything larger than like 10 KB I can't even upload it because it reaches a timeout. I set the timeout to 5 minutes and I can't upload a 23 KB png file.
I am using VS 2022 - Version 17.3.3 and created the project today (with NET 6.0), so its completely new and clean.
Even when not debugging, the upload takes the same amount of time. Is there something wrong with my system?
