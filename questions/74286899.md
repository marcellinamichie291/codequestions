# Assign values to multiple objects with similar name

Let's say I have five lists for five different climate variables, each of them with similar naming, just differing in the climate variable:
# define variables name vector
variables <- c("U", "V", "T", "RH", "GHT") 

# create a list for each variable
for (i in 1:length(variables)) {
  assign(paste0(variables[i], ".list"), list())
}

Now I would like to fill the single lists with respective data for each variable.
# create some sample data
U.vec <- seq(0,50,10)
V.vec <- seq(10,60,10)
T.vec <- seq(20,70,10)
RH.vec <- seq(30,80,10)
GHT.vec <- seq(0,25,5)

This can achieved by a multi-line loop:
for (i in 1:length(U.vec)) {
  U.list[[i]] <- U.vec[i]
  V.list[[i]] <- V.vec[i]
  T.list[[i]] <- T.vec[i]
  RH.list[[i]] <- RH.vec[i]
  GHT.list[[i]] <- GHT.vec[i]
}

I am sure there is a more elegant way to do this, since at both sides the same variable name is included. Anybody with a hint?
