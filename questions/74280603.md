# fork code executing code block twice in output file

I have this basic code about parent/child relation:
#define _DEFAULT_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>


int main(){
    int sum = 6;
    int *p = (int*) mmap(NULL, sizeof (int) , PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    *p = 7;
    printf("filled %d in memory\n", *p);
    int pID = fork();
    if (pID == 0){
        printf(" found %d\n", *p);
        printf(" sum inside %d\n",sum + (*p));
        exit(0);
    }
    else if (pID> 0){
        wait(NULL);
        printf("sum %d\n",sum+ *p);
        printf("exit\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    return 0;
}

when i compile it in terminal it gives me this result:
filled 7 in memory
 found 7
 sum inside 13
sum 13
exit

but when i want to keep that output in a .txt file with ./a.out > output.txt command, my code seems to run filling block twice and my output.txt file is filled by this:
filled 7 in memory
 found 7
 sum inside 13
filled 7 in memory //**printed twice
sum 13
exit

How can I solve it?
