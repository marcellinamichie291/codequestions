# How to test contracts that somehow cannot be tested by feign client?

We have the following contract in provider:
Contract.make {
    request {
        method GET()
        url('/something/a/b/c') {
        }
    }
    response {
        status 400
    }
}

This is a contract for an endpoint which has a required query parameter. If the query parameter is missing, then the application returns 400 (BAD_REQUEST).
Now, in the consumer, we use feign client for service interactions. When trying to test this contract, we can't find a way to test this specific contract because feign is a little bit restrictive.
The feign client endpoint:
@GetMapping("/b/c") 
public List<Function> getFunctionsBy(@RequestParam @NotNull LegalFormType legalFormType) {
    return facade.getBy(legalFormType);
}  

How the right way would be? I was thinking at 2 things:

Create contracts that can be tested (this seems like a bad idea because we won't have contracts for every case)
Do not use the application's client (feign client) and use another tool to make the requests (I think this will introduce one more thing to take into account, the tool used).
