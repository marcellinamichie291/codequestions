I have input that changing value when button is click, I want to put event listener in that input when the value is change. I tried it using on change but it's not working. Does any one know what event listener should I use?


const btn = document.querySelector('button')
const inp = document.querySelector('input')

btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
        inp.value = 2;
})

inp.addEventListener('change', function () {
        alert('hell');
   // do something here
})
<input type="text" id="rating1"/>
<button id="rateBtn1">Change</button>
