# how to make html webpage a part of website

I've just created my own website with my own domain with IONOS.
On the side, I had created a webpage which was hosted using XAMP, so currently to view my webpage I have to use the URL http://localhost/project1/index.html#
However, I'd like to integrate it into my website if possible?
For example have a section on my webpage where I show a thumbnail of the webpage and when clicked it takes me to www.mywebsite.co.uk/project1
I'm not sure how to go about this though?
