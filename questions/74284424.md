I have a file containing multiple lists.I need to compare only the first element of each list and print the list containing the smallest element.
eg: \[1,2,3,4,5\] \[11,33,22,55,33\] \[0.1,234,35,21,123\]
now taking the 0th element of the list and comparing it with each other?
Right now I haven't figured it out yet.
