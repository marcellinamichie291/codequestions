# I am unable to Unable to style wtform elements with css

I am trying to implement css on my wtform. I am unable to change the margin or color of the elements in wtform. I tried using class_ instead of class and using <div> to wrap my element, but they also did not work. Can I know what went wrong with this?
This is the css
.testing{
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  color: red;
}

This is my html documentation.
    {% for post in posts %}

    {{ post.title }}
    {{post.content | safe}}

    {% endfor %}

    <h1>Our form is here</h1>

    <form method = "post" action ='/post_wtform'>
    {{form.csrf_token}}
    
   
    {{form.title.label(class="testing")}}
    
    
    {{ form.title(class="testing")}}
    
    
    {{form.content.label(class="testing")}}
    
    <div class="testing">
    {{form.content(rows = '5') | safe }}
    </div>
    
    <input type="submit" value = "submit">

</form>
