# Python Polars attach attributes to Series in DataFrame

I am trying to add attributes (variable labels) to the series of a Polars DataFrame that describe the data, in the hope that these would remain there at least in operations such as selecting or renaming some columns. It turns out that this does not work the way I hoped it would. Is there any way this can be done in Polars?
    import polars as pl
    data = pl.DataFrame([
        pl.Series("col1", [1, 2], dtype=pl.Int64),
        pl.Series("col2", [3, 4], dtype=pl.Int64)
    ])
    
    namlab = pl.DataFrame([
        pl.Series("names", ["col1", "col2"], dtype=pl.Utf8),
        pl.Series("labels", ["This is column 1", "This is column 2"], dtype=pl.Utf8)
    ])
    
    # This is the way I hoped I could assign label attributes
    for nam, lab in namlab.rows():
        data[nam].label = lab
    
    data["col1"].label  # But they are not here: attribute error
    
    # On the other hand I can
    col1 = data["col1"]
    col1.label = "This is column 1"
    col1.label # Retrieve the label: works!
    
    # Perhaps replacing the entire series solves the issue...
    data = data.replace("col1", col1)
    
    data["col1"].label  # Nope: attribute error
