# What is a software system where you enter some information to verify a physical document called?

I apologize in advance if this isn't the correct place to ask this question. I am looking for a system that can verify the the membership cards issued by a company. For example, if someone needs to verify a membership card, they can visit a website and enter information such as the membership number and date of birth, and then the system checks if someone with matching information exists or not. If they exist, then the system shows something like "Verified" with additional information about the membership holder, such as their name and phone number. I also want to know if there are any companies that offer services like this. Also, English isn't my first language so feel free to ask in comments if anything isn't clear to you. Any help will be appreciated.
I haven't tried anything. Not even know what these types of software are called.
