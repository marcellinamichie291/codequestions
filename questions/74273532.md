# How do I create a calculated column in Pandas


I want to create a new column, BSI.
The formula:
BSI = ln((1+nPd)/(1+nNd))

d = date
nP: sum of Positive Predictions
nN: sum of Negative Predictions

In essence,

I want to group the pred_rate column by date,
Get the sum of positive predictions (1) and negative predictions (0) for each group
Perform the BSI calculation as a new column in the data

The data frame in the image is a snippet of a larger one.
Thank you.
