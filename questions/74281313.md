# Export a column of data as a .TXT document

I'm looking to get the sheet "PrintTXT" and cells "$C$1:$C$45" to export when I press a button with a macro attached that is located on a different sheet, within the same workbook)
I would like if the .txt document's name when pressing the export button has the current (today's) date & the value of a specific cell (Sheet "LEXIS ENTRANCE FORM" Cell"A6". as the file's save name. Example- 11_1_22_TestAccount
I'm new to this, I've use before and took a long break since, but would like any info if able on what variables are editable
I've been hopping around trying other's codes posted to export a text document from data in a singular column but cannot figure out how to export with the formula results, I get a #ref when exporting as it seems like it's not copying the result.
`#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
#REF!
