# Could not find 'librealm-jni.so'. Looked for: [x86], but only found: []

My app has been working smoothly for the last few months. But since last week I have been getting the following error a lot,
Fatal Exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to create application com.foo.bar.MyApplication: com.getkeepsafe.relinker.MissingLibraryException: Could not find 'librealm-jni.so'. Looked for: [x86], but only found: [].

This issue has 40 crash events affecting 7 users (My app only has less than 3000 installs).
These are the affected devices,
Nexus 5X
HUAWEI WDGF4587
QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009) <= Someone experimenting with my apk?
Motorola One Vision (rooted)

for a similar issue,
someone suggested to use android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false
This blog post says that Android won't be able to load 32- and 64-bit native libraries concurrently. In my app, I'm also using other libraries such as uCrop and my own native codes. The solution he suggested is to simply exclude all 64-bit binaries from your APK.
Does anyone know the implications of the above-mentioned fixes?
