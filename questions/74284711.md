# Distance Calculation Issue

I am working on an app where I have to calculate distance with the help of many coordinates.
To verify code, I am comparing my distance with google, here I am facing an issue.
To test, I took 8 point/coordinates of a straight road, let's call these points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Distance from 1 to 8 (from starting to end) is 3Km (remember, it is a straight road).
Then I calculate distance from 1 to 8 by adding all points as stop on google map (e.g: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8), this distance is also 3km.
Then I calculate distance from one point to next on google map and at end I added these distances (e.g: (1 to 2) + (2 to 3) + (3 to 4) + (4 to 5) + (5 to 6) + (6 to 7) + (7 to 8))
This is not returning me 3Km, this is returning me 2.95Km.
Please have a look on attached images:


Now, the below image is showing calculation of separate distances (e.g: 1to2 + 2to3 + 3to4 + ..... + 7to8) that is equal to 2.95Km.
