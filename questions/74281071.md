# Go from square data to .ply format

I currently have data of a surface arranged in a square fashion,
The data was created by something like this
`
import numpy as np
U = np.linspace(0, 1, nx)
V = np.linspace(0, 1, ny)
Uv, Vv = np.meshgrid(x, y)

X = f1.(Uv, Vv) 
Y = f2.(Uv, Vv) 
Z = f3.(Uv, Vv)

color = C.(Uv, Vv)

`
Where X,Y,Z are the coordinates of my surface and color is the color at each point of my surface.
How do I go from this to a .ply file?
Unfortunately I don't really know how to create meshes from this type of data.
