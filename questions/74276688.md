How can I for a pip project specify that I need either package foo or package bar depending on what is available?
More specifically Tensorflow seems to ship in pip package named tensorflow for linux and a package named tensorflow-macos for Mac. How to make a pip package that can be installed on both platforms?
Seems the project is using setuptools, (it is not my project)
