# TypeError: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined - please help me with inherited code

I inherited a piece of appscript from a pervious person. Though it all looks right i get the following error:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'range' of undefined
setTimestamp    @ Donetimestamp.gs:8
The code is
const DONE_COL = 13;
const STAMP_COL = 16;

function setTimestamp(e) {
  let timestamp = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), "GMT+11", "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss");

  // extract what we need from the range of the selected cell
  let range = e.range;
  let sheet = range.getSheet();
  let row = range.getRow();
  let col = range.getColumn();
  let value = range.getValue();

  if (col === DONE_COL && value === "Yes") {
    sheet.getRange(row, STAMP_COL).setValue(timestamp);
  } 
}

Tried to debug myself but cannot understand why range is undefined. Made a literal copy of previous code but it fails. The error is happening on line 8 "let range = e.range;"
