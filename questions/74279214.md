# Charles 4.6.2 does not intercept traffic on Android 11

I set up both my Mac and Android according to manual but still can't see traffic from my Android within Charles

Steps in Charles:

Go to Proxy > Proxy Settings > SSL > Check “Enable SSL Proxying”
Select “Add location” and enter host name () and port ()
Install and trust Charles cert in keychain

Steps on Android:

Enable USB debagging mode
Connect device via cable
Configure proxy hostname and port (exactly the same as in Charles settings)
Download the Charles certificate and install it manually from settings, because it is Android 11


I am wondering why I did not see this message in Charles
(I tried swithing off and on "Enable Debug" mode and switch off and on cable.)
It normally intercepts traffic from applications on Mac desktop. I suggest that issue in Android version, because on < 11 versions everything worked to me. Any ideas? Thanks
All advices from here: How do I configure Charles Proxy and Android so that I can view HTTPS sessions
