# Using different delimiters in sed commands and range addresses

I am using sed in a shell script to edit filesystem path names. Suppose I want to replace
/foo/bar

with
/baz/qux

However, sed's s/// command uses the forward slash / as the delimiter. If I do that, I see an error message emitted, like:
▶ sed 's//foo/bar//baz/qux//' FILE
sed: 1: "s//foo/bar//baz/qux//": bad flag in substitute command: 'b'

Similarly, sometimes I want to select line ranges, such as the lines between a pattern foo/bar and baz/qux. Again, I can't do this:
▶ sed '/foo/bar/,/baz/qux/d' FILE
sed: 1: "/foo/bar/,/baz/qux/d": undefined label 'ar/,/baz/qux/d'

What can I do?
