# Android Studio java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity {} failed to create web view

I really need help. My application has no errors in the build or as I build it in aab/apk. But when I debug the app on an emulator it keeps crashing after the splashscreen. The LogCat gives an error which I could not fix. Plz help.


I cleaned and rebuilt it many times, but it did not work at all.
