# Styling the iframe elements of the Trustpilot application tag

In shopify,
I have a trustpilot reviews widget on my site that uses an iframe tag. And I need to style some internal elements. I do this through javascript, using observer, because the widget needs to wait.
To test, I just set a red background for the body tag inside the iframe, and that style is applied for literally 1 second, and after that, the style is gone. Also, I looked at the styles in the DOM, but my styles are not there. Can you please tell me why this happens and how to fix it? Here is the code:
let observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
    let widget_iframe = document.querySelector('iframe');
    if (widget_iframe) {
        let style = document.createElement("style");
        style.textContent = 'body: { background: red; }';
        widget_iframe.contentDocument.head.appendChild(style);
        observer.disconnect();
    }
});
observer.observe(document.body, { attributes: true, attributeFilter: ["style"], childList: true, subtree: true });
