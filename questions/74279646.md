I have a simple JSFiddle here demonstrating my issue.
I have this JavaScript code:
var b = document.getElementById("b");

function A() {
    this.f = "1";
}

A.prototype.t = function() {
    b.innerHTML = this.f;
};

var a = new A();

var l = a.t;
l();

Why is this undefined when I try to call a.t? How do I recover that context without being overly verbose or storing too much?
