# How to get a list of all firewall rules including rules created by Group Policy in C#

I've been working on a security audit that requires me to parse all file and printer sharing firewall rules. If a firewall rule is enabled it must have a matching firewall that is also enabled and has the action of block in order for the audit to pass, otherwise it fails. However the blocks I want to be able to parse are created by group policy and do not show up in the list when I use the INetFwPolicy2 code below.
INetFwPolicy2 firewallPolicy = (INetFwPolicy2)Activator.CreateInstance(Type.GetTypeFromProgID("HNetCfg.FwPolicy2"));
var firewallRules = firewallPolicy.Rules.OfType<INetFwRule>().Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("File and Printer Sharing (")).ToList();

However I can get a list of results I want running this command in CMD, I just don't know how I could utilize this via C#. I've found resources online on how to run a CMD command, but not really how to utilize the output in a way that would help me with what I'm trying to do.
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all dir=in type=dynamic

This was my original logic I was trying to utilize with INetFwPolicy2 before I realized it wasn't listing any of the Group Policy created firewall rule blocks which are vital to making this work as intended.
foreach (var fwRule in firewallRules)
{
    //if rule action is enabled run Linq query of that same rule name checking if theres another rule with a block for that rule -pass condition
    if (fwRule.Enabled && fwRule.Action != NET_FW_ACTION_.NET_FW_ACTION_BLOCK)
        {
            //now we check if there is a rule with the same name of this and profile that has its action blocked - pass
            if (firewallRules.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith(fwRule.Name) && x.Action == NET_FW_ACTION_.NET_FW_ACTION_BLOCK) != null)
            {
                pass = true;
            }
            else
            {
                pass = false;
                //fail
                //now find what profiles it has and set those as being enabled
                if (fwRule.Profiles == (int)NET_FW_PROFILE_TYPE2_.NET_FW_PROFILE2_DOMAIN)
                {
                    domainProfileEnabled = true;
                }

                if (fwRule.Profiles == (int)NET_FW_PROFILE_TYPE2_.NET_FW_PROFILE2_PRIVATE)
                {
                    privateProfileEnabled = true;
                }

                if (fwRule.Profiles == (int)NET_FW_PROFILE_TYPE2_.NET_FW_PROFILE2_PUBLIC)
                {
                    publicProfileEnabled = true;
                }

                if (fwRule.Profiles == (int)NET_FW_PROFILE_TYPE2_.NET_FW_PROFILE2_ALL)
                {
                    allProfileEnabled = true;
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            pass = true;
        }
}
