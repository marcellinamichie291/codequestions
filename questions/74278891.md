# close unbalanced brackets with text inside

I am trying to close a string with unbalanced brackets:
Input:
'[([first word], hello, world),(second word], good, evening'

Desired output:
'[([first word], hello, world),([second word], good, evening)'

Found a great solution here, but it works only with brackets, without text inside.
How can I adjust this code to work with actual text, and close unbalanced brackets with longest distance?
f=lambda s:s[::-1].translate(" ] [)(} {"*14) ## lambda that flips a string, and reverses all the brackets in it
def m(a): ## function that takes a string and matches every unclosed opening bracket (ignores unopened closing brackets)
    u=[] ## list holding all currently unclosed brackets
    b="" ## string that the result is build in
    for x in a: ## loop through the input
        if x in"([{": ## if its an opening bracket
            u+=[x] ## add it to the unclosed list
        elif u and x!=f(y:=u.pop()): ## if there are unclosed brackets and this bracket doesnt close the last opened one
            b+=f(y); ## add the necessary closing bracket
            u.pop() ## pop the extra opening bracket that x closes
        b+=x ## no matter what, add this character to the result
    return b+f("".join(u)) ## join the remaining unclosed brackets into a single string, flip it with f(), and add it to the result
M=lambda a:f( ## Flip the final string back to the correct order
         m(f( ## Flip the string and apply m again to match the unopened closing brackets
         m(a)))) ## Apply the above function to the result to match all unclosed opening brackets

Input:
"[([{])]}"
"[(text[{text],)]}"

Output:
"{[([{}])]}"
"{[([{()}([]}[{{}}([]}]})]}"
