# TableDataAdapter.update() and TableDataAdapter.Fill() it take long time

have table with 200 columns, and when try to fill or update apporx. (15000) rows using the following:-
TableDataAdapter.update(DataTable)
TableDataAdapter.Fill(Datatable)

it take around 8 mins and some cases stacked and not complete the process
then tried to use the below code for select command to fill
        Dim My_Trans as SQLTransaction
        Dim My_Table as new DataTable
        Dim My_SQLDataAdapter as new SqlDataAdapter
        Dim My_BindingSource as new BindingSource

        conn.Open()
        My_Trans = conn.BeginTransaction()

        myqry = "Select * From My_Table"
        My_SQLDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter(myqry, conn)
 
        Try
            My_SQLDataAdapter.SelectCommand.Transaction = My_Trans
            My_BindingSource.DataSource = My_Table
            DataGridView1.DataSource = My_BindingSource    '(<----- her is take long time)

            My_Trans.Commit()
        Catch ex As Exception
            My_Trans.Rollback()
        End Try
        conn.Close()

but still take the same time , even for update command too, when tracking found the time taking in (DataGridView1.DataSource = My_BindingSource)
any advise please how speed up fill and update process?
many thanks in advance
