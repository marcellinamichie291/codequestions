# Print Output of Module Deployments Status in Bicep

Let's say I have a bicep template that has multiple modules like the following:
module storageAccount ".../location" = {
 ...
}
output storageAccountStatus string = 'SA deployed!'
module keyVault ".../location" = {
     ...
}
output keyVaultStatus string = 'kv deployed!'
module functionApp ".../location" = {
     ...
}
output functionApp string = 'fa deployed!'

If I were to execute this template and it fails, how would I get the output of the statuses?
The MS Learn documentation on this says that you can only get the output of a successful deployment: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/outputs?tabs=azure-powershell
It can also be cumbersome to me to have to manually get the output of the individual module deployment's output.
Is there an easy way to know which module fails to deploy if you put them all in one bicep template?
