# Angular application compiled successfully but isn't loaded in the browser, also throwing a lot of unknown errors in the console

I upgraded my Angular application from Angular 6 to Angular 14, after a lot of work I finally solved all the errors and the application was compiling successfully. But now when I open the local server to take a look at it, it doesn't display anything on the screen just a small div and some of my components.
There are a lot of web socket related errors in console.
WebSocket connection to 'ws://lms.localhost/ng-cli-ws' failed: 
[webpack-dev-server] Disconnected!
[webpack-dev-server] Trying to reconnect...

After this most of the errors are coming from main.js and polyfill.js
main.js:1 TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'show')
    at template (main.js:1:2358105)
    at Eg (main.js:1:4163057)

    at Q1.detectChanges (main.js:1:4172019)
    at c.tick (main.js:1:4231256)
    at c._loadComponent (main.js:1:4231564)

Most of the errors are similar to this and looking into the main.js and polyfill.js file I didn't found anything useful it felt like it was just full of gibberish.

I found out that when some components are initiated their constructors are called but their ngOnInit() methods aren't called.

Can someone help me out at-least in finding where the error maybe coming from. This is the output that I am getting Output of my browser and console screen
