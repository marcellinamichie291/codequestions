In this code:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
 
void my_function(const char* value)
{
    std::cout << "char *  " << (value ? value : "nullptr");
}

void my_function(const std::string &value)
{
    std::cout << "string";
}

int main()
{
    my_function({});
}

The const char * overload is chosen, passing a nullptr pointer.  Can somebody explain why? I assume this is something weird with initializer lists? (By the way, this happens with my_function(string value) too, so it isn't the reference).
This caused a crash in our code because somebody added a const char * overload, causing the rare caller who passed {} to send in a nullptr.
