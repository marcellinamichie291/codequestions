# How to stop loading Roboto fonts from Google maps on my Wordpress website?

I build a website using Wordpress. But due to the new regulations in Germany we have to host all fonts locally in our server. I did this but Google maps still loads to Roboto fonts. I would like to know is there a way to stop loading these fonts? Below you can find the code that is been used by the plugin to show this map
