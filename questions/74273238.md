I want to show same product in 2 different names in shop page and in single product page?
for example in product page product name "Green Cotton Shirt" in shop or product archives page product name "Green Shirt". but url will be "website.com/green-cotton-shirt"
So long story short I want to add another product title section under woocommerce default product title in admin dashboard that will not effect to product URL.
I need solution for that. maybe some php code for function.php or simple plugin.
