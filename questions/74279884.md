# Lexical react : a plugin for formik forms that manages rich text state of lexical?

I'm trying to make a new plugin for lexical, starting from the rich text editor example here:
https://codesandbox.io/s/lexical-rich-text-example-5tncvy
any suggestions?
I want to be able to reset the state of the lexical editor with formik and submit the data to a database.
