# Multiple form error handling with react-hook-form

i need to maintain error object of every form in single object which is released by react-hook-form, any ideas?
form 1 error object i get
{
firstname: {
message: "required field",
type: "required"
}
}

form 2 error object i get
{
email: {
message: "required field",
type: "required"
}
}

expected result:
{
form1: {
firstname: {
message: "required field",
type: "required"
}
},
form2: {
email: {
message: "required field",
type: "required"
}
}
}
