# AWS Rekognition detect and save face from image

As per AWS Rekognition document, there are some methods available which I can use to detect the face in image and it returns me response in below format-
         "BoundingBox": {
            "Width": 0.36868685483932495,
            "Height": 0.5219123363494873,
            "Left": 0.6035353541374207,
            "Top": 0.4302788972854614
        },
        "Confidence": 99.55957794189453

Is there any way I can use this response and crop original image to capture only face.
Example- Capture photo from passport/DL.
