# SELECTING a comma-separated list of items grouped under shared column results using SQL in Redshift

Say for example I have the following in a table:




grouping
user_id




A
abcdefg


B
123456


A
hijklmn


A
opqrstu


B
789012


C
...




The result I would like to SELECT in a single query is:




grouping
user_id




A
abcdefg, hijklmn, opqrstu


B
123456, 789012


C
...




... and so on as far as there is a unique 'grouping' and the user_ids found under those groupings.
Is it possible to do this in a single query?
I have done some research of my own and seen syntax such as XML, CONCAT and others but as far as I can tell those answers do not account for multiple lists and multiple groupings.
