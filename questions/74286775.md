Kotari bad an array A of N integers. He computed it's Average array B of  size N, where
B[i] = j = OiA[j](i + 1)
In other words, B[i] is the average of the first (i + 1) elements of A.
He lost array A and can't remember what its elements were. Help him fin d the original array A given its Average array B.
Input Format
First line contains an integer T- the number of test cases.
â€¢ 1 <= T <= 1000
First line of each test case contains an integer N-the size of the array B.
1 <= N <= 100000
The second line of each test case contains N'space-separated integers- the elements of the array B
-10^9 <= B[i] <=10^9
The Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 10 ^5
