# elasticsearch how to use preference in node.js

I am sending requests from Node.js to ES,
It was fine before I put the "preference" option to the code.
and I am getting the same error : "Unknown key for a VALUE_STRING in [preference]."
my code :
`
client
    .search({
        _source: TEST_TILEDS,
        index: TEST_INDEX,
        size: _.isNumber(pageSize) === false ? 20 : pageSize,
        body : {
            min_score: 1,
            query,
            explain: false,
            preference: userUuid,
        },
    })

`
I want to use Custom value for preference options like the documents said here 
When I tried in Kibana it worked well with localhost:9200/_search?preference='asdf'
but if I put the preference key value in the inside of {} json like below, then it just doesn't work out.
`
GET alias_search_tabling_restaurant_production/_search
{
  "query": {
     "bool":
      blabla 
  },
  "preference": "asdf"  // 
}

`
Is there any solution for this?
Thank you in advance.
like I explained above, I tried in Kibana but only url + options worked but not the options in json  or node.js code.
