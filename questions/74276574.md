# Explain why BeginExecuteNonQuery with connection.close; doesn't run while connection.Dispose does

I have the following code:
connection.Open();

command.BeginExecuteNonQuery(delegate (IAsyncResult ar)
{
    try { command.EndExecuteNonQuery(ar); }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ExceptionLogger logger = new ExceptionLogger();
        string errorMessage = this.HandleError(logger, ex);
    }
    finally
    {
        connection.Close();
        connection.Dispose();
    }
}, null);

I am using this code to call an stored procedure, but this only works if I remove the connection.Close(); and I can't figure out why this is? Is there anybody that could explain this to me?
edit: It appears that the stored procedure is sometimes not even called when the connection.close() is removed
