# OData Openedge service in .Net. Entity and Key name conflict

Trying to Implement OData service in .net, the OData Metadata is from Progress Openedge. The "Entity" name and "key" name are the same, can't fetch key values (null).
How can I get key values?

Tried changing values of attributes hoping to make mapping successful. Looking for other solutions.
