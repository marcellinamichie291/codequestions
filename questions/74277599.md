# Running a command to install 'ipykernel' into the Python environment. How do i go about it @python

Running cells with 'Python 3.11.0 64-bit' requires ipykernel package.
Run the following command to install 'ipykernel' into the Python environment.
Command: '"c:/Users/Pauline Gitau/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe" -m pip install ipykernel -U --user --force-reinstall'
I tried the above command and i got a syntax error #beginner in python
