# Expo crashes with redux toolkit

I just added react-redux with reduxjs/toolkit on react-native.
I tried in dev mode and its been working fine.
I tried with expo start --no-dev --minify and it crashed.
I decided to publish it and when I launched it, my app instantly crashed.
Why ?
package.json
{
  "name": "cusual test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start",
    "android": "expo start --android",
    "ios": "expo start --ios",
    "web": "expo start --web"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native-picker/picker": "2.4.2",
    "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.4.0",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.0.13",
    "@react-navigation/native-stack": "^6.9.1",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.8.6",
    "@types/axios": "^0.14.0",

    "react-native-screens": "~3.15.0",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.2.0",
    "react-native-web": "~0.18.7",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.12.9",
    "@types/react": "~18.0.14",
    "@types/react-native": "~0.69.1",
    "@types/react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.12",
    "typescript": "~4.3.5"
  },
  "private": true
}

This line makes my app crahes :
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Router />
    </Provider>
  );
};

If I comment provider's lines, it doesn't crash anymore.
Did I miss anything ?
I'm using SDK 46 and expo 6.0.6.
Thanks for help.
