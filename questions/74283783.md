# How to programmatically set color in gimp (pythonfu)?

Using Python, I was able to add a floating text layer using
text_layer = pdb.gimp_text_fontname(image, drawable, x, y, text, border, antialias, size, size_type, fontname)

However, the text appears in black. Specifically pdb.gimp_text_layer_get_color(text_layer) returns RGB (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
I want the font to be in a different color.
I tried
col = gimpcolor.RGB(44.7, 46.7, 58.0)
pdb.gimp_text_layer_set_color(text_layer, col)

Trying pdb.gimp_text_layer_get_color(text_layer) now returns RGB (44.7, 46.7, 58.0, 1.0) but the text in now in white.
How to make the text appear in my desired color or where does gimpcolor object's documentation exist?
