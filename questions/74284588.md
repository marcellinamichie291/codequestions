# Covariant return types in function pointers

I want to have a safe function pointer that can point to a function that returns a more derived trait. Here is a simplified example of what I would like to accomplish which mimics what I'm looking to do in my actual code.
Godbolt link: https://godbolt.org/z/8bns6KaEa
trait Animal {}
trait Mamal: Animal {}

struct Cat {}

impl Animal for Cat{}
impl Mamal for Cat {}

fn main() {
    let function: fn() -> Box<dyn Animal> = return_cat;
}

fn return_cat() -> Box<dyn Mamal> {
    Box::new(Cat{})
}

This of course doesn't compile because the function return_cat is returning a Box<dyn Mamal> and the function pointer signature is expecting Box<dyn Animal>.
This isn't technically a case of covariant return types since the return type is actually Box and rather I want the generic parameter of Box to be covariant in this case.
Any way to get this to compile in Rust or do I need to completely rethink my solution?
