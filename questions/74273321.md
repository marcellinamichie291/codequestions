# how to use grep with logical operator AND

when searching for packages i'm using grep if not installed i have to install it using shell script as mentioned below:
if
list packages installed | grep rap | grep rap-devel
## only if both are installed then exit with status 0
else
install the missing packages
How should I do this?
I tried this but its very lengthy
yum installed packages | grep rap

if $? = 1
  yum install rap

yum installed packages | grep rap-devel

if $? = 1 
  yum install rap-devel


And I dont think its a good practice to do like this. Can anyone help me to shorten this? what if there still more to search and install ðŸ¥²
