# Django JavaScript Array

I have the following JS code:
data: [40, 60, 30, 65, 60, 95, 90, 100, 96, 120, 105, 134]

This represents a curve in a graph on HTML.
I want to draw a line (same value 12 times), and this value is brought by Django.
The value is 100. I tried the following:
in Django: limit = [mylimit for i in range(1,12)]
in JS: data: {{ limit }}
didn't work.
I even tried creating the list manually on Django: limit = f"{limit}, {limit}, ...." and doing this on JS: data: [{{ limit }}] and nothing works.
My goal is to take whatever limit I have (aka: 100), and have the following JavaScript: data: [100, 100, 100.....
