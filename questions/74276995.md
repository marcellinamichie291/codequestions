# Unable to display the video on my React application, from my cloudfront URL

I'm trying to access a video from my private S3 bucket, via a CloudFront URL. I can see that after 2 calls, the third call is getting canceled on its own. I'm unable to figure out the issue, which in turn doesn't display the video. I've tried various React players as well. Any pointers would be a great help. TIA.
