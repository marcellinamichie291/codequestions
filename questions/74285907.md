# Can I specify the type of a function at definition from a Protocol?

In a project, I define a function type using Protocols from the typing module but the functions matching that Protocol are scattered in different files. I would like to indicate that a particular function matches the Protocol (to find them more easily) but I cannot find how.
For example, here I would like to indicate that f is an FType :
from typing import Protocol

class FType(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, a: int) -> float: ...


def f(a: int) -> float:
    return float(a)

I tried the following :
from typing import Protocol

class FType(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, a: int) -> float: ...


def f(a: int) -> float:
    return float(a)


def g(a: int) -> str:
    return str(a)
   

f: FType = f  # OK
g: FType = g  # not OK


This allows me to find the functions matching FType in my editor but I don't like the repetition and g: FType = g is not detected as an error by mypy.
Is there a better way of doing so ?
Something like this would be nice :
:FType
def f(a: int) -> float:
    return float(a)
