# Can I create list of vaulted passwords in ansible?

I would like to define several vaulted passwords and store in a variable, and then use it to create several users with password.
code looks like
variable.yml
password:
  - !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          636

  - !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          637

.
.
.
.
and then I want to iterate this variable in my playbook main.yml


- name: run script
  command: "python3 script.py {{ item.location }} {{ item.password }} {{ item.phrase }}"
  with_items:
  - { location: "{{ location }}", secret: "{{ password }}" , passphrase: "{{ sphrase }}" }


I tried create list by adding "-" but throws error "msg": "Vault format unhexlify error: Non-hexadecimal digit found
