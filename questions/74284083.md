# In nested stored procedures - how to safely continue run the calling procedure even if the inner procedure fails?

I have one scenario, where I have nested stored procedures. I want my main procedure to continue running even if the called procedure (it just have some logging in a table) didn't run successfully.
can you please help.
many thanks!
main Stored Procedure
exec testSP -- Inner SP
-- I want the following code of main SP to run even if the inner SP fails or there is sometime issues or anything that makes it to fail
code for the main SP
