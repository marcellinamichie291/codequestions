# How to confirm from user if he wants to leave the page while filling form?

I am creating a form where user can fill data. Based upon the user's input and selected options I'm showing the next data to fill using js which works totally fine.
Now what I want is if the user presses the back or exit button accidentally. I want to confirm with the user if he really wants to exit from the current page.
