# Background color does not change on ionic4

I want to change my application background color. I use;
ion-content { background-color: green; }
And no matter the color, it stay white. Then I noticed there some green at the back around buttons. It as if there's a layer of white that I'm not sure how to remove.
At first I though it was my dark mode, changed it and its still there. I reached out my lecturer and even she don't know, so I hope you all can help.
