# Changing a single property of an object inside of array

I have such state in my React project:
  const [information, setInformation] = React.useState([
    {
      Email: "",
      TellNo: "",
      Username: "",
      NationalityType: "",
      pIDCheck: "",
      VerificationCode: "",
      Password: "",
    },
  ]);

I want to update "TellNo" value when input values changes. I tried many approaches like this:
     onChange={(e) =>
            setInformation((prev) => [{...prev, TellNo: e.target.value }])
          }

but as you can see. it will add an additional object. how can I change my TellNo without adding an object
