# Convert PG file contains many images

I have a pg file when I open it in Windows 7 I notice that it contains many images in one file.
Currently using python I'm trying to count the number of images inside this file or extract them but I can't find anything about pg files.
When I used an online converter, all the images were extracted and uploaded to a ZIP file
I'm trying to use the same thing but using Python but only get one image.
Note: I used the pillow library (there is only one file 1.pg for example)
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('1.pg')
rgb_img = img.convert('RGB')
rgb_img.save('image.jpg')
