# why my HDD disk with logical and physical sector both are 512B size, but files storage still aligned with 4096B

my system is linux_x86_64, have a HDD disk
NAME   ROTA
sda       1
|-sda1    1
|-sda2    1
|-sda3    1
|-sda4    1
`-sda5    1

both logical and physical sector are 512B
Disk /dev/sda: 10.94 TiB, 12002095882240 bytes, 23441593520 sectors
Disk model: LOGICAL VOLUME
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

when I write a file with 4 chars for example, but I got the file use 4096 disk space
(base) protoss:/data/ryan.gao$ echo "123" > testfile
(base) protoss:/data/ryan.gao$ du -sh ./testfile
4.0K    ./testfile

but why ? should't it be 512B?
