# WKWebView Not Opening Camera And Gallery Using Image Capture SDK

I have problem with using identity service with WkWebView. When I need to open my camera and see permission for opening camera I see error. Also I add permissions to camera and gallery in info.plist and in configuration of webview allow allowsInlineMediaPlayback, but still it doesn't work.
