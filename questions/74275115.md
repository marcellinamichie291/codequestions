# React Native Axios Network Error but works fine on postman client

I'm trying to get axios working on a react native project to reach a backend but I am getting the Network Error issue that I just can't seem to debug.
 const searchApi = async () => {
  try {
    let res = await axios.get('https://product.company.com/api/documents/invoices');
    console.log(res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
 }

So if I was to do a get request to the example url provided via Thunder Client or Postman Client, I get the appropriate response of
{
    "status": "401 error",
    "message": "Token not found."
}

But when done through axios, I seem to get a network error. I'm a little unsure how I can debug this too to get more error logs.
