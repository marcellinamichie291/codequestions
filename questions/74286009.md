# How to accept only one of multiple fields in Go Validator?

type CoolName struct {
    Foo string  `json:"foo"`
    Bar string  `json:"bar"`
}

With the Go validator, I want to make only one of these two fields required and give an error if the content of both fields is full.
I used required_without but it only helps with requiring one of them. I can't figure out how can i validate if both fields doesn't have a content at the same time.
