# Printing a browser page that is not open (Javascript and/or Jquery)

I'm wanting to be able to theoretically pass a URL to a window.print() (yes I know you cannot pass a url to this function) via a button. Then the print window would pop up with a page/article that you are not currently on in the browser.
For example: Let's say I am on Facebook.com and I have a share button for an article that pops up on Facebook.com. Lets say that when you click share, there is a print button that when clicked it will print the article (let's say this article is google.com for example). When I am on Facebook.com I want to be able to print Google.com using that share button WITHOUT having to even go to the website/page Google.com.
Is this something that is possible with javasript/Jquery. I have been doing a lot of research into it but not finding anything that would fit this criteria.
Thank you for your help!
I have tried setting up a jquery function that takes in a doc url and print the window but it continues to print the current page that I am on.
I have tried doing a lot of research on the idea but am continuing to see problems where people are only trying to print the page that they are currently on.
