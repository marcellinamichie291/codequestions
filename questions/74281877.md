# XML Sitemap not working with Google Search Console..?

I have an XML sitemap located at https://store.usbswiper.com/sitemap_index.xml, which as you can see loads just fine.
However, Google Search Console is telling me it can't fetch the sitemap.
When I use this validator it's giving me a successful validation.
I have checked the robots.txt, and it's not blocking anything.  It specifices the sitemap URL correctly as well.
Any info on why Google Search Console is giving me this "couldn't fetch" message would be greatly appreciated.
EDIT:  When I first ran that validator it gave me this error:
Incorrect http header content-type: "" (expected: "application/xml")
I added a robots.txt and then when I ran it and posted this thread it was validating successfully.  I just now tried again and it's failing again with the same message.  I don't understand why it's working sometimes and sometimes not.  The Search Console hasn't successfully loaded at all no matter what the validator is doing.
