# React App Docker image copy is taking too long

Below is my Dockerfile
FROM node:16 as build-stage

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json /app/

ARG PROJECT_NAME=react-ui

RUN npm install --force 
COPY ./ /app/
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

RUN rm -rf ./*

COPY --from=build-stage /app/build/ .

EXPOSE 8080 

ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Step --> COPY ./ /app/ is taking too long, currently almost 50 mins and running. How do I fix this?
I tried building without the below step and it takes 4 mins average
RUN npm run build

but what I understand is we need to include npm run build too, right? This is my first time dockerizing a React Frontend App. Your help would be really appreciated, thank you
