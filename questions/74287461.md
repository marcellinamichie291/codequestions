# Error while compiling HAProxy from source

I got this error while trying to compile the HAProxy 2.2 with LUA version 5.3. I'm on trying to do it on CentOS7(arm64).
[root@08d17a479616 haproxy-2.2.22]# make TARGET=linux-glibc USE_PCRE=1 USE_PCRE_JIT=1 USE_OPENSSL=1 USE_ZLIB=1 USE_LINUX_TPROXY=1 USE_REGPARM=1 USE_LUA=1 USE_THREAD=1 USE_TFO=1

What I've tried until now is to create a symlink to the libatomic.so with this
ln -s /usr/lib64/libatomic.so.1.2.0 /usr/lib/libatomic.so

And installed the missing GNU library from here with the steps outline in the article.
Install CentOS SCLo RH repository:yum install centos-release-scl-rh
Install devtoolset-7-libatomic-devel rpm package:
# yum install devtoolset-7-libatomic-devel


What should I do to resolve it ?
