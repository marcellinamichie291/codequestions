# How can I retun a list of absolute paths?

The following code returns a list of file-names in a given directory:
def get_files(dir_path_str):
    onlyfiles = next(os.walk(dir_path_str))[2]
    return onlyfiles

How can I make it return absolute file paths with minimal modification and preserve the behavior of the function?
