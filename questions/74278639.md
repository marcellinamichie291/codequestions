# Using cur_column() and sym() in dbplyr

I have a situation where I need to divide columns in a database, across() multiple columns. When the divisor column is fixed, I can use !!rlang::sym() to specify the correct column, but I have one instance where the divisor column changes as a function of the current columns name (i.e., gsub("_lump_sum","_lump_noNAcount",dplyr::cur_column()).
See example below:
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
copy_to(con, name ="mtcars", df=mtcars %>% mutate(across(c(gear,carb),~.*2,.names = "{col}_2")))

# This works as intended
tbl(con,"mtcars") %>% 
  summarise(across(any_of(c("vs","am")),~sum(.)/sum(!!sym("wt"))))

# This doesn't work
tbl(con,"mtcars") %>% 
  summarise(across(any_of(c("gear","carb")),~sum(.)/sum(!!sym(paste0(cur_column(),"_2")))))

# Error in `cur_column()`:
# ! Must be used inside `across()`.


I realize that cur_column() can't work with !!, but I also need it evaluated before it goes to the database because cur_column() can't be evaluated on the database side either.
Is there a different way of doing this?
Thanks
