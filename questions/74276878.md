# When does a MWAA environment update it's requirements, and is it an automatic or manual process?

Pretty much title.
Supose I edit the requirements.txt file to add a new package, or to change package versions. When will the environment apply these changes, and what manual steps do I have to take (if any) to make that happen?
The aws documentation on the procedure states that one must simply go through the 'Edit' settings, but in the case I didn't even change the filename is it necessary?
