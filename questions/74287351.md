# android multidex: enabled but not helping

I updated my app to use multidex
multiDexEnabled true

and upped my minSdkVersion to 21:
ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "30.0.3"
        minSdkVersion = 21
        compileSdkVersion = 31
        targetSdkVersion = 30
        javaVersion = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

so when I start building my app I first get this
> Configure project :app
[SafeDK] Your project has been updated to support Multi-Dex!
With Multi-Dex support you can use as many methods as you like in your application (no 65K method limit)


but later the build fails with:
[SafeDK-ERROR] Main Dex exceeded 65K methods or field references, Exception: Main Dex exceeded 65K methods or field references


why is that? how is this contradiction possible?
