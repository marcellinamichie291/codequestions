# INVALID_ARGUMENT Error for Google Cloud Dataflow

I've got a python pipeline which takes a file from Cloud Storage, removes some columns, then uploads the result to BigQuery. If I run this locally using the Dataflow runner, everything works as expected, but whenever I try to set it up with the Dataflow UI so I can schedule it etc. no job gets created and this
INVALID_ARGUMENT error gets thrown in the logs:
(Ids etc. removed)

I can't find out anything about this error and gcp doesn't seem to provide any additional info.
I've tried to use gcp logging in the python code but the gcp error seems to get thrown before any code is executed. I've also removed all of my optional parameters so there shouldn't be anything you're required to enter in the gcp set-up that isn't default.
