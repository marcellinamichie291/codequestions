# GLIBC version mismatch between my build and my target hosts

I work with a beaglebone board (but probably it's not so important on which board)
it has linux-4.9.82-ti-r102 kernel version installed and I can't change it.
I created a code  
, and tried to run it on the beagle 
(steps: I compiled with arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -ggdb user.c -o user and then forwarded to beagle with scp user debian@192.168.7.2:/home/debian, on beagle I tried to run user ./user)
but I got an error
GLIB versions on the BeagleBone
 
GLIB versions on my PC
 
what should I do, I canâ€™t update the beagle because I need exactly the linux-4.9.82-ti-r102
can I somehow change the versions of GLIB (like in gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc) or whatever
