# How to remove element from list if part of it appears in another list in python

So let's say I have a list_1 = ["ABC_123,Hello,World","DEF_456,Hello,World"] and a list_2 = ["ABC_123,Something,Else","KOR_729,Something,Else"]. What I want to do is remove the elements from list 1 that contain the same first part of the string as in list 2, in this case "ABC_123".
The expected output would be list_3 = ["DEF_456,Hello,World"] , which is list 1, but with "ABC_123,Hello,World" removed since the part "ABC_123" appears in an element of list 2.
