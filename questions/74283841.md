# Duplicate components because of layout in svelte

I am in svelte kit and I have a component TopNav that has many custom properties such as clientPage (weather it is a client page or not) and I have the TopNav component in my root +layout.svelte like shown:
<!-- /routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
    import TopNav from "@components/TopNav.svelte";
</script>
<TopNav noSpace />
<slot />

and one of my nested pages /routes/app/+page.svelte:
<!-- /routes/app/+page.svelte -->
<script>
    import TopNav from "@components/TopNav.svelte";
</script>
<TopNav noSpace clientPage>
  TopNav with content
</TopNav>

and right now it compiles to something like:
<!-- mock compiled code shiped to browser -->
<script>
    import TopNav from "@components/TopNav.svelte";
</script>
<TopNav noSpace />
<TopNav noSpace clientPage>
  TopNav with content
</TopNav>

Is there some way I could remove the first TopNav component in the layout or use something like svelte:head to change the way the first TopNav is displayed?
I have tried creating a layout file in /app/ like so:
<!-- /routes/app/+layout.svelte -->
<slot />

however it still compiles the same way.
