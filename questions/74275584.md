# Axon @EndSaga SagaEventHandler is not triggered at all, and @StartSaga SagaEventHandler is retried multiple times

I am trying to create a saga, and start this saga by triggering an event. However, after the event is triggered, I just get an endless loop for "claim on token". and it retries to execute this code all the time. and it just runs it after a few seconds.
@StartSaga
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "eventId")
    fun on(event: CreateTargetReferenceEvent) {
        println(event.eventId)
    }

My issue here is that I try to trigger @EndSaga event, but it never happened. I am sure the eventId is the same in the @StartSaga and @EndSaga, and both of the events are triggered in the right way since the corresponding event handlers are triggered elsewhere.
I'm not sure what I have missed here to make the @EndSaga triggered. Please help.
This the @Saga component
@Component
@Saga
internal class TestSaga {
    var testString: String = ""

    @Autowired
    private lateinit var commandGateway: CommandGateway
    
    @StartSaga
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "eventId")
    fun on(event: CreateTargetReferenceEvent) {
        println(event.eventId)
    }

    @EndSaga
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "eventId")
    fun on(event: UpdateTargetReferenceEvent) {
        println(event.eventId)
    }
}

And there are the outputs:
