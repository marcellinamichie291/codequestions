# Tinymce wiris integration license expired

I have a web application which have frontend angular. I have used tinymce as the editor in that and integrated wiris for math equations and chemical formulas. At the time of integration, when contacted the wiris support, it was told that wiris integration do not need any licenses. But now after hosting the application in public domain and used for about 2 months, when opening wiris editor message regarding license is shown.
