# Split columns in Draw.io table

I currently have a Draw.io Table (single column), but the problem is that I want it to be split.
Let's say i got one column containing the full name (John Smith), but based on the space I want it to split to two tables. One for first name and one for last name.
Can this be achieved in Draw.io?
(alternatively a workaround using Excel would also be acceptable)
