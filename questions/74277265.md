# npm install looks frozen when trying to install coreui react template

I am pretty new to react. As part of a dashboard implementation I am trying to install coreui react template.
So I have cloned the project into my local directory and from the the project folder I tried npm install
But it looks frozen and it doesnt show any progress.

I didnt understand what I did wrong.
