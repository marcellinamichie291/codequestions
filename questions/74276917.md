# Hiding sub view in Stackview adds extra space

I have an app with a horizontal stackview which contains 3 UIViews.
When all 3 UIViews are visible it works fine like this:

However if I hide one of the UIViews dynamically like this a space is added in the stackview between the 2 UIViews:
secondView.isHidden = true


How can I get rid of the extra space? In Xcode I have the stack view's spacing set to 0. I don't know how to solve this. Please let me know if you know how to solve this.
