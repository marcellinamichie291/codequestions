# How can we refresh standard template in a salesforce community?

I have created one experience site on Salesforce and in that  Cart to be updated is the cart which I want to update and want to show the cart items number once user upload cart item from upload file widget. Right now it is not getting updated and even if I add some products on cart it is showing no value. Upload file widget is lightning component which I have made and cart is the standard template of community.
