# Verifying a Hangfire Enqueue

Can anyone explain to me why when I try to verify, in a unit test, that my background job client (Hangfire) was enqueued, I get "Invaild virtual (overridable in VB).." exception, yet when this same enqueue is contained within a catch block... all is good?
Throws Exception Code Example:
public void GetPDF(PDFparam param){
   _backgroundClient.Enqueue(IHelper)(x => x.GetPDFHangfire(param))
}

Does not throw:
public void GetPDF(PDFparam param){
   try{
     ThisWillThrow();
   }
   catch(Excpetion e){
     _backgroundClient.Enqueue(IHelper)(x => x.GetPDFHangfire(param))
     throw();
   }
}

and the test
private Mock<IBackgroundJobClient> _mockBRJClient = new Mock<IBackgroundJobClient>();   

_mockBRJClient.Verify(x => x.Enqueue<IHelper>(y => y.GetPDFHangire(It.IsAny<PDFparam>())), Times.Once);

I did fix the test to not throw using the approach of:
_backgroundJobClient.Verify(x => x.Create(
           It.Is(job => job.Method.Name == "GetPDFHangfire"),
           It.IsAny()));

But this is a matter of curiosity now.. any insights?
