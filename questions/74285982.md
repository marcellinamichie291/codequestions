# Unable to reach localhost from Chrome, after having installed Rancher desktop on Windows 10

After having installed Rancher desktop on my Windows 10 laptop, I cannot reach services listening on localhost through Chrome. Rancher desktop is configured to support Moby/dockerd.
The error reported by Chrome is:
This site canâ€™t be reached
The connection was reset.
Try:

Checking the connection
Checking the proxy and the firewall
Running Windows Network Diagnostics
ERR_CONNECTION_RESET

Replacing localhost with 127.0.0.1 they are reachable, instead.
Ping resolves localhost to 127.0.0.1 correctly:
PS C:\> ping localhost

I noticed that the hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) contains the following entry:
# To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal
# End of section

I tried to add
127.0.0.1 localhost

to the hosts file, unsuccessfully.
I tried to run the following:
netsh winsock reset
netsh int ip reset
ipconfig /release
ip/config /renew
ipconfig /flushdns

and to restart the pc, but it didn't work, either.
I also tried solutions to similar problems, like:

Localhost not working in Chrome, 127.0.0.1 does work

chrome wont let me access localhost (it google searches instead)


Any suggestion to solve the problem?
