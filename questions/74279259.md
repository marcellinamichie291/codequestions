# Vscode unable to auto indent after enter in bracket - Javascript

I want my code to indent after pressing enter inside brackets on javascript
After entering in brackets, my code will look like this:
const somefunc = () => {
}

I want to look at my code like this:
const somefunc = () => {
    //indented
}
