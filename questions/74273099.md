# Why const or let is not throwing an error before initialising value while using debugger (chrome)

As per ECMA, We should initialise the const / let before using it. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const.
Below code is working as expected,
function sample(){
    console.log(color);
    const color = 'skyblue'
}

Below code is not working while debugging (Attached Screenshot - Refer Local section).
Not getting error as expected,
Follow the same code & call the sample() Fn,
function sample(){
    debugger;
    console.log(color);
    const color = 'skyblue'
}
