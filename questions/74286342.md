What does "context" of "Widget build(BuildContext context)" mean in Flutter?

I am learning Flutter and studying right now to make navigations. But looking at the keyword context in different places confuses me:
    Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute<void>(
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: TextButton(
          child: Text('POP'),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
));

Could anyone explain what context represents in each case. Thanks
