# Selenium fails to locate element even though it's loaded and not in an iframe

I'm trying to locate an element in a form, but for some reason Selenium keeps throwing an error saying it can't be found. Here is the simple code that I'm using. Can anyone decipher why this isn't working? It looks like a basic HTML form.
driver = uc.Chrome()
driver.get('https://www.stumblechat.com/register')
username = driver.find_element(By.ID, 'user')
