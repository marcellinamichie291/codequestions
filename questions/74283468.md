# Kubernetes Service account issue in airflow 2.4.2

We have to start our kubernetes pod in a separate namespace.This namespace will be different from namespace in which airflow is running.This is for applying istio injection on that separate namespace.We are using kubernetes executor.
We tried two approaches:

In pythonoperator specified executor_config with namespace specified .This did not work and pod started in same namespace as airflow.
In kubernetepodoperator we specified namespace and a service account with permissions to that namespace .But default service account within namespace where airflow is deployed is being used , because of this we are getting forbidden error on that service account.

Is there something we are missing?
