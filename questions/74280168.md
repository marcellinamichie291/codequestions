# AWSCLI getting InvalidCiphertextException when decrypting locally encrypted file using AWS KMS

I am trying to decrypt a locally encrypted file using AWS KMS. The AWS KMS key was already created via the console and then I'm using the cli to to do the encryption and decryption. The decryption is failing.
I have created a customer managed AWS KMS key on AWS, here's the output from aws kms describe-key command:
{
    "KeyMetadata": {
        "AWSAccountId": "<redacted>",
        "KeyId": "<redacted>",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-2:<redacted>:key/<redeacted>",
        "CreationDate": "2022-11-01T14:02:40.684000+00:00",
        "Enabled": true,
        "Description": "CST MED1 FORT-B",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "KeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT"
        ],
        "MultiRegion": false
    }


I can successfully encrypt a local file using this command:
aws kms encrypt --key-id <redacted> --plaintext fileb://field342med1 --output text --query CiphertextBlob --region eu-west-2 > field342med1.encrypted

However when decrypting this file using the following command:
aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://field342med1.encrypted --query Plaintext

i get the following error:
An error occurred (InvalidCiphertextException) when calling the Decrypt operation:

I have changed the fileb:// to file:// which eliminates the error but it's not decrypted to what was in the original plain textfile.
Any ideas please?
Any ideas how I can resolve this please?
