# Spring rest controller with 10000 json records in request body

I want to create a rest API that should be able to receive around 10 thousand records. Each record has 5 attributes. Example for 2 records:
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "name1",
      "mobileno": "99999999",
      "address": "testaddress",
      "anotherfield": "anothervalue",
      "testField": "testValue"
    },
    {
      "name": "name2",
      "mobileno": "88888888",
      "address": "testaddress2",
      "anotherfield": "anothervalue2",
      "testField": "testValue2"
    }
  ]
}

What is the best approach to design this API? Should the API accept a json with 10 thousand records or should it accept a multipart file (in case of file, is excel a good choice)?
