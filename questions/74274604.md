Recently i did a site for a client. After receiving it the client sent the site for acunetix security check, which brought back this alert.
----acunetix alert--- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.example.com Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Any origin is accepted (arbitrary Origin header values are reflected in Access-Control- Allow-Origin response headers). For the WordPress /wp-json/ endpoint, this may be
the intended behavior and requires manual review. For further information, please refer to the WordPress REST API Handbook linked in the "References" section below.` --- the end of acunetix alert ---
i finally found where this is located - in rest-api.php
function rest_send_cors_headers( $value ) {
    $origin = get_http_origin();
    if ( $origin ) {
        // Requests from file:// and data: URLs send "Origin: null".
        if ( 'null' !== $origin ) {
            $origin = esc_url_raw( $origin );
        }
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ' . $origin );
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE' );
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true' );
        header( 'Vary: Origin', false );
    } elseif ( ! headers_sent() && 'GET' === $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] && ! is_user_logged_in() ) {
        header( 'Vary: Origin', false );
    }

    return $value;
}

Can anyone let me know what should i do in this case? How do i fix is or i just should let it be how it is done by wordpress. thank you so much in advance.
