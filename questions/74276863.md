# Power Bi DAX Measure not recognizing columns

I recently changed my data source to an Azure SQL DB, I kept the column/table names and datatypes the exact same as previous for a smooth transition. However, for two of the tables the new columns are not recognized in the original DAX measures even though they are named the same, this is also causing issues in tabular editor and DAX studio.
I have worked through the ETL process and can't see any issues throughout, the only thing that seemed to work was changing the column name in power query to the exact same name. Any ideas if this is on the SQL side or an issue with Power Bi?Â 
I expected this to work without any issues.
