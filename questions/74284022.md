# "Check with Administrator" error in excel print from .NET code

I am printing a excel file in xlsm format from .NET application.
When data exceeds 50k rows , it shows "Check with Administrator" error on excel generation.
This error occurs only in case of datas above 50k rows in my 1st sheet.
How this error is related to how big my data is?
I am not able to find any solutions related on the internet.
Please Help
