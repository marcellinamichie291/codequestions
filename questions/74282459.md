# Java interfaces and memory accolcation

Suppose you have a class Delta that implements interface Alpha. Alpha has methods a, b, and c, and Delta defines an additional method d. If the line "Alpha object = new Delta()" is written, will the compiler allocate memory for the method d even though the reference will not be able to access it?
