I need to write the predicate Frequest(InList, OutList) to find the list
OutList of all elements that occur most frequently in the given InList.
Here is my code, help me write more professional and understandable for everyone please.
`counter([], _, 0).
counter([X|T], X, C) :- counter(T, X, C1), C is C1 + 1.
counter([X|T], Y, C) :- X == Y, counter(T, Y, C).

max_count([], , 0).
max_count([E|L], L1, C):-
    counter(L1, E, C1),
    maxcount(L, L1, C2),
    C is max(C1, C2), !.

max_count_el([], , _, []) :- !.
max_count_el([X|L], L1, M, LR) :-
    ffff(L, L1, M, LR2),
    (   counter(L1, X, C),
        C == M,
        + member(X, LR2),
        append(LR2, [X], LR); 
        LR = LR2
    ).

frequentest(L1, L2):-
    max_count(L1, L1, R),
    max_count_el(L1, L1, R, L2), !.`
