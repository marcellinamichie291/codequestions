# JPA, SQL Server Suitable Type for Numeric, Bit and datetime in Java - JPA

I'm working with SQL Server.... and I was trying to create the Entity... taken fields from this Contracts Table, as you can see I have bit, numeric and datetime fields.
The version of SQL is:
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SP2) (KB4052908) - 13.0.5026.0 (X64) 
    Mar 18 2018 09:11:49 
    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
    Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2016 Standard 10.0 <X64> (Build 14393: ) (Hypervisor)

Here the example Table
CREATE TABLE signs.dbo.Contracts (
    Identification numeric(8,0) NOT NULL,
    DV varchar(1) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL,
    Product varchar(3) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NOT NULL,
    Sign_Sate bit NULL,
    Sign_Date datetime NULL,
    CONSTRAINT Contracts_PK PRIMARY KEY (Identification,Product)
);

I was only Starting...
First the composite ID
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@EqualsAndHashCode
public class ContractId implements Serializable {

    private ????? identification; // WHAT TYPE is suitable FOR numeric???
    private String product;

}

Now the Table/entity
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter
@Setter
@Builder
@Entity
@Table(name = "Contracts")
@IdClass(ContractId.class)
public class Contract {
    @Id
    private ????? identification; // WHAT TYPE is suitable FOR numeric???
    @Id
    private String product;

    private String dv;

    private ????? signState; // WHAT TYPE FOR BIT, boolean???

    private LocalDateTime signDate; //LocalDateTime?
}

I would like to know:
What Type of primary/object are suitable for numeric, bit and datetime?
Thanks in advance!
