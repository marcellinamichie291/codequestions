# Python: portaudio can't update audio devices [Mac]

I install portaudio by homebrew (brew install portaudio) then I use sounddevice.query_devices() to get all available device on my Mac, but when I change device and recall sounddevice.query_devices() that not update new device.
I trying to use this :
sd._terminate()

change device:
sd._initialize()

but I can't update new device when I recall sounddevice.query_devices()
How do I fix it in my project? Thanks for your answer!
