# Timeout error when trying to receive data from Elasticsearch

I am trying to receive a big amount of data from EC (about 45,000 documents) to my Java program. But I always get the error:
022-11-01 17:37:27.185 ERROR 106796 --- [nio-8080-exec-2] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.dao.DataAccessResourceFailureException: 5,000 milliseconds timeout on connection http-outgoing-0 [ACTIVE]; nested exception is java.lang.RuntimeException: 5,000 milliseconds timeout on connection http-outgoing-0 [ACTIVE]] with root cause
java.net.SocketTimeoutException: 5,000 milliseconds timeout on connection http-outgoing-0 [ACTIVE]
This is the code line where it falls:
Iterable<SomeClass> docs = someRepository.findAll();


Is there a way to increase the time until timeout, or is there any other solution?
