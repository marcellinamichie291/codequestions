# Extending from FormField in a Stateful Widget

Extending from FormField in a Stateful Widget
I have a Stateful widget with properties and functions. I would like to extend the widget from FormField, because I need to validate some user input on the widget.
It seems that it is not possible to extend from multiple classes (StatefulWidget and FormField).
If I try to create a normal class that extends from FormField:
class CustomInput extends FormField<bool> {
  final Widget label;
  final void Function(bool?) onChanged;

  userClicked() {
    print('User clicked');
  }

  CustomInput({
    required this.label,
    required this.onChanged,
    FormFieldValidator<bool>? validator,
  }) : super(
          validator: validator,
          builder: (field) {           
            return Column(
              children: [
                TextButton(
                  onPressed: () => userClicked(), //<-- The instance member 'userClicked' can't be accessed in an initializer.
                  child: Text('Call internal function'),
                ),
            

... then I cannot access internal methods because of the 'The instance member 'userClicked' can't be accessed in an initializer.' error.
So how do you create a widget that extends from FormField to use the validator, onChanged, onSaved etc., but at the same time have internal logic that can be accessed normally from the widget tree?
