# PHP - Isolate context with include

I want to include some PHP plugins, which should be able to modify a single variable ($input). The function I am using is the following:
$globalVariable = 'Hello, World!';

function plugin($type, $file, $input){

    if($type == 'foo'){

          return include('../foo-plugins/' . $file);

    }
    else{

          return include('../bar-plugins/' . $file);

    }

}

And the plugin file:
<?php

    global $globalVariable; // This should not work

    echo $file; // This should not work
    echo $type; // This should not work

    return 'Hello ' . $input; // This should work

?>

This post explains how to pass a variable, but does not solve my problem as all variables are passed on.
How can I set the context for the included file so it only has access to the single variable $input?
I am open to any alternative approaches, that don't necessarily use include or require. Any help would be much appreciated!
