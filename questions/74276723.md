This is my code and what I am trying to do is that if the value of "data" is null and it does not have any value assigned, I get the message "not available" but even if it has a value the error continues to appear, how can I correct it for that when it has a value the message does not come out and the box is not painted. available" but even if it has a value the error continues to appear, how can I correct it so that when it has a value the message does not appear and the box is not painted.
"createdRow":function(row, data, index){
            if(data[6] == null && data[6] !== undefined){
              $('td', row).eq(6).css({
                'background-color':'#ff5252', });
                $('td', row).eq(6).append("<p>No disponible :(<p>");
             
            }
