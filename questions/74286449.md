# inject GA4 script in the html of a static site with javascript

I have the following situation:

a static site, only html pages
a cookie notice system, with my own cookies, accept and refuse system of cookies setup

Now I need to inject the GA4 script into the head of pages when cookies are accepted, but...
I have already made made that, by appending the script to the head and it is visible on browser, on page reload with inspect elements...and it's working perfect.
When users click on accept cookies, the cookies accept is saved on client's side, and the script is APPENDED to page.
But I need the GA4 script to be somehow INJECTED, to be visible on the source page. Like when I preview the source page in browser to have it there. I don't need it to be injected into the html file itself, but only into the browser.
I did my own research about these days, and now it's killing me, as all I could find was the append way, but that is not injecting it into the source page on browser.
Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
Note (as I have been asking all the time. I don't want to offend anyone, but that's the best way I can explain where I want to do and what):

the source page I'm talking about is when right click on browser and view source page (there is where I need the GA4 code to be inserted)
and the way I got it to work is when right click > inspect > elements tab - (there i have it now working)

Thank you!
