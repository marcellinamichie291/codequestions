# livewire on rerender can't access the request value, until next browser refresh

My problem is, when i make a very simple pagination with Laravel Livewire, the first page appear just fine, but when i click "Next Page/Page Number", the result just disappear, even though there are still more results to show, i'm absolutely got no idea, no mattter how i try.
the same problem when i try delete one category
Here is my Component code:
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire\Admin\Category;
use App\Models\Categories;
use Livewire\Component;
use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class Index extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;
    protected $paginationTheme = 'bootstrap';
    public $category_id;
    public function deleteCategory($category_id){
        $this->category_id=$category_id;
    }
    public function render(Request $request)
    {
        $categories = Categories::orderBy('id','ASC')->paginate(1);
        return view('livewire.admin.category.index',['categories'=>$categories]);
    }

    public function destroyCategory(){
        $category = Categories::find($this->category_id);
        $old_image_patch = 'admins/images/categories/';
        if (file_exists($old_image_patch.$category->image)){
            unlink($old_image_patch.$category->image);
        }
        $category->delete();
        session()->flash('message','xoa thanh cong');
        $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('close-modal');

    }

}


I have already include the livewire @livewireStyles and @livewireScripts, and i can't find an answer anywhere else cause i don't see any question that match my problem, and i'm kinda new to livewire
