# two sheet date search and data move from input to output sheet

I want to click Button 1 on the INPUT sheet.. Have it look for the date from/in a designated cell.. then take the cells (ie.  DailyHRS, Sorties, ASR, PAX, CARGO, POPHRS) data and move it to the other sheet OUTPUT, find the same date from sheet INPUT on the OUTPUT sheet and move the data to this sheet, in cells next to the matching date from the first sheet INPUT


I have searched for this by examples, but nothing is an exact match to what I am looking to do.
