# How to eliminate pixel offset generated while try to draw points based on the color of the pixels [OpenCV]

I'm trying to draw a horizontal line across a shape (ellipse in this instance with only the centroid and the boundary of the ellipse on a black background) starting from the centroid of the shape (ellipse) . I started off checking each and every pixel along +x and -x axes from centroid and replacing each non-green pixel(boundary) to a white pixel (essentially drawing a line pixel by pixel) and stop converting as soon as I reach the first green pixel (boundary). Code is given at the end
According to my logic, the line (created using points) should stop as soon as it reaches the boundary aka first green pixel along a particular axis but there is a slight offset of the detected boundary. In the given image, you can clearly see the right and left most points calculated by checking each and every pixel is slightly off center from the actual line
 
Images are enlarged for better view
I checked my code multiple times and I freshly drew ellipses every time to make sure there is no stray green pixels left on the image but the offset is consistent for each try
So my question will be: How do I get rid of this offset and make my line incident on the boundary perfectly? Is this a visual glitch or Am I doing something wrong?
Note: I know there are rectFitting and MinAreaRect functions which I can use to draw perfect bounding boxes to get points but I wanted to know why this is happening. I'm not looking for  optimal method instead I'm looking for the cause and solution for this issue.
If you can suggest better/accurate title, its much appreciated. I think I have explained everything for the time being.
Code:
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%inline matplotlib

#Function to plot images
def display_img(img,name):
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    ax.imshow(img,cmap ="gray")
    plt.title(name)

#A black canvas
canvas = np.zeros((1600,1200,3),np.uint8)

#Value obtained after ellipse fitting an object
val = ((654, 664),(264, 266),80)

centroid = (val[0][0],val[0][1])

#Drawing the ellipse on the canvas(green)
ell = cv2.ellipse(canvas,val,(0,255,0),1)

centroid_ = cv2.circle(canvas,centroid,1,(255,0,0),10) #High thickness to see it visibly (Red)

display_img(canvas,"Canvas w/ ellipse and centroid")

#variables for centers
y_center = centroid[1]

#Variables which iterate over time
right_pt = centroid[0]
left_pt = centroid[0]

#Using while loops to find the distance from the center to the 
#nearby first green pixel (leftmost and rightmost boundary)

while(np.any(canvas[right_pt,y_center] != [0,255,0])):
    cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1)
    right_pt += 1

while(np.any(canvas[left_pt,y_center] != [0,255,0])):
    cv2.circle(canvas,(left_pt,y_center),1,(255,255,255),1)
    left_pt -= 1

#Drawing the obtained points
    
canvas = cv2.circle(canvas,(right_pt,y_center),1,(0,255,0),2)
canvas = cv2.circle(canvas,(left_pt,y_center),1,(0,255,0),2)
display_img(canvas,"Finale")
