# Block Theme Template parts - Why saving a part updates the other ones?

I was wondering what could be wrong with this...I am building some parts of "new" Full Site Editing and notice that when I am going to save one of its parts, on the sidebar it shows other parts to save/update.
In the example in the screenshot, I am just editing the navbar template part, but see the other things present to be altered, even if they are not available in this part to be edited. There is another model "Header", there is a page "Home" and seven reusable templates to be saved!
The issue with updating the whole site this way is that I don't know what is being changed.
Do you know any configuration which should be done not to this occur? Or is there any documentation that explains this new paradigm? Or is it a bug to be fixed anytime?

In fact, I did press the button one with all the checkboxes marked and some of the other template parts went away emptied (I gone nuts).
See in the second attachment that I could go back and retore previous state (thank goodness!)
