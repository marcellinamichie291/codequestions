# Automation anywhere: Acknowledging first email of the thread

Is there anyway that you can program a bot in automation anywhere community version, using the loop function (for every email), using outlook, to get the bot to check if there is an existing conversation in the inbox. If no history of conversation, then the bot acknowledges the email, if it does match a thread in the inbox then it files the email...I have googled everywhere and I have an inclination that it has to be driven by using the script options using messageid as a unique identifier. Any suggestions?
I tried vbscript mostly but I can't get the vbscript to even push out a unique id. I know it will somehow have to do with the loop until it meets or doesn't meet a messageid match but I believe the bot may be too simple to do this.
