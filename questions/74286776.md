# path error when running Pytest tests from cmd

I have this issue with Pytest where unit tests run fine from PyCharm but doesn't when I run through pipeline "python -m pytest".
Below is my project structure:
Common
   |_____configuration.py
   |
Services
   |
   |-----ServiceA
   |        |
   |        |___src
   |        |    |___utils
   |        |           |__ __init__.py
   |        |           |__   helper1.py
            |           |__   helper2.py  
   |        |___Test
   |              |___utils
   |                     |__  __init.py
   |                     |__    test1.py
   |                     
   |-----ServiceB
   |
   |

In helper1 I have code as
 from Common import configuration

Tests runs absolutely fine when I run through Pycharm because it resolves all path but when I run it through pipeline, I get below error when running through cmd,
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Common' 
Can anyone help how to resolve this issue. TIA
