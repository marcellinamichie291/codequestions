# Is JSchemaGenerator supported in .net 6?

I am trying to migrated .net framework code to .net 6. In my project we have used json functionality extensively. I was able to find the nuget package which is corresponding to Newtonsoft.Json in .net 6 i.e Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson.
All the functionality is working as it is after including this nuget package but the code related to JSchemaGenerator is not working in .net6. Is this obsoleted in .net6. If yes how can we achieve this schema generation functionality in .net 6(core).
