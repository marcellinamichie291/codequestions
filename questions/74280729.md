# how to find value of key with multiple conditions

I have dictionary something like below :
{
 '0': ['a', 'b'],
 '1': ['c', 'd'],
 '2': ['e', 'f'],
 '3': ['g', 'h']
}

now, I need to find out the value of key 'g' if 'c' has a value 'd' and 'e' has a value 'f'
I tried using below way , but not working. Not getting how to pass multiple conditions
    var myKey = dict.Select(a => a.g.Value).Where(c.d && e.f);

please suggest
