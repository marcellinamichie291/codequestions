# Google Spreadsheet: How to import HTML(JSON/RestAPI) from intranet/localhost

I'm using Google Spreadsheet. I have some web-based APIs in my intranet (Let's say 192.168.0.0/24). I want to load some results from these APIs.
When I just use ImportHTML or something in the spreadsheet, it looks like google (or its proxy) tries to connect to the target but obviously google can't connect to the closed intranet.
=IMPORTHTML("https://192.168.0.100/app.html", "table", 1)

Is there any way to retrieve contents from the intranet ? It's something like following.
=IMPORTHTMLLocal("https://192.168.0.100/app.html", "table", 1)
or maybe like
=IMPORTHTML("https://192.168.0.100/app.html", useBrowserNetwork=1)

I tried to use IMPORTHTML() and IMPORTJSON() from https://apipheny.io/import-json-google-sheets/ but either way, the HTTP client was google instead of my PC.
