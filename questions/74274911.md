# Prisma QueryRaw does not compare dates correctly

I've noticed a strange behaviour with my query raw that I want to perform. In my query, I want to take only matches that happened BEFORE a given date, however the query returns matches that started at the same time that I give to the query. However, when I hard-code the same date in the query, the match is not included, which is the behaviour I want. Tools I'm using:

"@prisma/client": "^4.4.0",
"prisma": "^4.4.0",
"@nestjs/core": "^9.0.0",
PostgreSQL 15.0 (Ubuntu 15.0-1.pgdg20.04+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0, 64-bit

I'm attaching a picture of a log from the query that is performed in the case it fails with parameters.
        //! THIS INCLUDES MATCH I DON'T WANT
        const date = parseISO("2022-04-16T15:00:00.000Z")

        const count = await this.prisma.$queryRaw` 

        SELECT "Match"."id", SUM("Stats"."cornerKicks") as "sumOfCorners"

        FROM "Match"

        INNER JOIN "TeamMatchStatistics" as "Stats" ON  "Match".id =  "Stats"."matchId"
        INNER JOIN "Season" ON "Match"."seasonId" = "Season".id
     
        WHERE "Match"."awayTeamId" = 125
        
         -- HERE IS THE CONDITION 
        AND "Match"."startDateTime" < ${date}
        AND "Match"."statusDescriptionShort" IN ('FT', 'PEN', 'AET')

        AND "Season"."start" <= ${date}
        AND "Season"."end" >= ${date}
        
        GROUP BY "Match"."id"
    `

        //! THIS WORKS FINE
        const date = parseISO("2022-04-16T15:00:00.000Z")

        const count = await this.prisma.$queryRaw` 

        SELECT "Match"."id", SUM("Stats"."cornerKicks") as "sumOfCorners"

        FROM "Match"

        INNER JOIN "TeamMatchStatistics" as "Stats" ON  "Match".id =  "Stats"."matchId"
        INNER JOIN "Season" ON "Match"."seasonId" = "Season".id
     
        WHERE "Match"."awayTeamId" = 125
        
         -- HERE IS THE CONDITION 
        AND "Match"."startDateTime" < '2022-04-16T15:00:00.000Z'
        AND "Match"."statusDescriptionShort" IN ('FT', 'PEN', 'AET')

        AND "Season"."start" <= ${date}
        AND "Season"."end" >= ${date}
        
        GROUP BY "Match"."id"
    `

I can't duplicate this locally, It happens only on the production DB. I tried adding ::timestamptz after the date, but with no successful result.
