# How do I print 5 file names which contain the most amount of lines

I have a single directory with a lot of different files in it.
I need to print out 5 file names that contain the most lines in them.
All of this needs to be done in a bash script.
I know that I should be using "wc" to count the lines, "sort" to sort them in order by the first number, and "echo" to print it all out.
I am still very new to this syntax and I am missing just the basic knowledge on how to do it.
At first I wanted to do it with for x in... but I just cant figure out a way for it...
