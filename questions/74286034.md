# Why power bi gives the following error :Fatal error encountered during data read.. '?

When I am trying to get my data from MySQL in Power bi, after some time power bi gives the following error: Failed to save modifications to the server. Error returned: 'OLE DB or ODBC error: [DataSource.Error] MySQL: Fatal error encountered during data read.. '.
Since I am working with json data type, I assume that perheps there is a problem with that, but how to solve this error?
I was looking for solution but I found only something about changing data type. So I did so but it stils gives me this error.
