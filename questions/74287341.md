# Invalid userId, please use letters, numbers

I'm using feeds and we have users authenticated with Auth0.  Auth0 prepends their generated ID's with "auth0|".  This is throwing the following error:
Error: Invalid userId, please use letters, numbers, - or _: auth0|60b843b8a6427
How can I make this work?  GetStream.io has published articles about securing your getstream application with Auth0, so surely there is a solution for this.
