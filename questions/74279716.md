# Persist multi selected ListTiles with Shared Preferences

My problem is summarized perfectly with this solution:
Flutter ListTile enable multi-select onLongPress
My app is using shared Preferences and Provider to produce a todo list.
After restarting my app, Shared-Preferences returns/persists my list, but the SELECTED TILES go back to their initial state, UNSELECTED.
How can I persist those tiles with color/icon changes using Shared Preferences?
Using the solution above as a code example
