# Lifetime declaration errors on struct with &str

I have a struct like this -
pub struct A {
    pub f: &str,
}

When I later try to assign a &str value to the struct using this -
fn use(&self, t: &str){
       let a = A {
            f: self.t,
       };
}

I get an error saying -
pub f: &str,
  |      ^ expected named lifetime parameter

I then changed my struct to use named lifetime parameters -
pub struct A<'i> {
    pub f: &'i str,
}

But it now gives error -
implicit elided lifetime not allowed here

note: assuming a `'static` lifetime...
help: indicate the anonymous lifetime

Can someone explain the second error and how can I fix it?
