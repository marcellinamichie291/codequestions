# electron: how got get data from renderer-process?

I am registering the close-event form the BrowserWindow in the MainProcess:
mainWindow.on('close', function (event: Event) {
    // get window.modelIsDirty from renderer-process and when it is true, show the dialog.
    const choice = require('electron').dialog.showMessageBoxSync(this,
      {
        type: 'question',
        buttons: ['Yes', 'No', 'Cancel'],
        title: 'Closing',
        message: 'Do you want to save changes?'
      });
    if (choice === 1) {
      
    } else if(choice === 2) {
        event.preventDefault();
    }
  });

Here I want to check, if my model is dirty and then ask the question for saving. The dirty-value is saved in the renderer-process as a property in the window-object.
I am searching now a way to access the renderer-process and read the value if my model is dirty synchron, when I need it for deciding to show the Message in the close-event.
