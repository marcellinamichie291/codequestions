# How to bind service from Java library in Xamarin Android Project


I have service class implementation in Example.aar
public class DemoService : Service{}

I have created a Native binding library project.

When i tried to bind this service in Xamarin.Android project.  bindService() is returning false.
var Result =context.getApplicationContext.bindService(new Intent(context,typeof(DemoService)), new ServiceConnection(),Bind.AutoCreate); //Result is false.



How to bind a service created in 3rd party library project in Xamarin Android project.??
