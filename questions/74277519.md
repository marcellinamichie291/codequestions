# EB CLI doesn't initialize EB repository

I want to initialize an EB repository with this AWS documentation
I run the init command
eb init -p python 3.8 myappname --region eu-west-3

it returns this message
usage: eb init <application_name> [options ...]
eb: error: unrecognized arguments: myappname
