I have a DataFrame that looks like this:
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['John','Mary', 'Phil', 'Sue', 'Robert', 'Lucy', 'Blake'],
    'age': ['15', '20s', 37, 'teen', '', 'elderly', 57]
    })

df


    name     age
0   John     15          
1   Mary     20s
2   Phil     37
3   Sue      teen
4   Robert  
5   Lucy     elderly
6   Blake    57

I would like to:

convert the age column into integers (where there is an integer already, or where one is able to be deduced, e.g. from a string)
otherwise replace with NaN

Here is what I'm looking to get:
name         age
0   John     15            <--- was originally a string
1   Mary     NaN
2   Phil     37
3   Sue      NaN
4   Robert   NaN
5   Lucy     NaN
6   Blake    57

How would I do this?
