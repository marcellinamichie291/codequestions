# TPM2.0 Secure Cert file and Private key generated by openssl

I generated a Cert file and Private key using openssl. These files are used to connect MQTT with TLS. How do I store/secure these files in the TPM on a raspberry pi. Once stored/secured how do I use them again?
Say in a command like this:
curl -v \
  -X POST https://<The-domain> \
  --cert ./encrytped-cert.pem \
  --key ./encrypted-key.pem \
  -d temperature=50

The end goal is to use these files in an MQTT python script. For now doing it in command line would work.
