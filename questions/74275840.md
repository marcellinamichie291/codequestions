# Dynamically access object in styled components

I have a simple object which defines colors:
export const BRANDS = {
    MYBRAND: {
        SHIRT: {
            PRIMARY: '#00cc81',
        },
    },
};

I import this into a component and am trying to access the primary color. I pass params into the styled component wrapper e.g.
<MyWrapper brand='MYBRAND' type='SHIRT'>
    <div className="MYBRAND SHIRT">...</div>
</MyWrapper>

Within the styled wrapper I'm trying to access the primary color, like so
import { BRANDS } from './colors';

const MyWrapper = styled.div<{ brand: string, type: string }>`
    .${({ brand }) => brand} { // this works as I expect
        &.${({ type }) => type} { // this works as I expect
            // This is causing the error
            background: ${BRANDS[`${({ brand }) => brand}`][`${({ type }) => type}`].PRIMARY};
        }
    }
`;

I want this to equate to the following scss:
.MYBRAND {
    &.SHIRT {
        background: '#00cc81';
    }
}

What I get is the following error:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_ref7 => {
  let {
    type
  } = _ref7;
  return type;
}')

Is it possible to do this?
