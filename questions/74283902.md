Time Complexity of two for loops [duplicate]

So I know that 1 for loop is O(N) and a for loop nested in a for loop is O(N*N), but what about two for loops not nested?
for example:

def ex(W)
for i in len(range(W)):
    if i == ...:
       return 
for c in len(range(W)):
    if c == ...:
       return
 

would this just be O(N) because each for loop is only running N times?
