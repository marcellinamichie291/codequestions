# I want to send POST data by ajax but it's not working because of CORS

$.ajax({
        type: POST,
        url : url,
        headers: { Content-Type: 'application/json', myheaderkey:'Sknetyla2'},
        data : data,
        dataType: "json",
        async: false,
        success : function (result){
            
        },
        error : function(e){
        }
    })

I tried this ajax but i got this message.
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'API URL' from origin 'MY URL' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field 'my header key' is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
It seems that preflight response accepts only 'Authorization, Content-Type, accessToken, CorrelationId, source'.
Then how can i send personal header?
