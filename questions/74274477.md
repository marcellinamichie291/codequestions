# Reactnavigation in RTL languages

So issue is that one of the app i working on as react-native developer is using
Material Top Tabs Navigator
Which is officially recommended by react-native but since it is depended on

react-native-tab-view
react-native-pager-view

and apparently react-native-tab-view have issue with RTL it not work properly.
Also in there limitation they also mention that rtl support is limited
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/limitations/
For me my app is causing weird behaviour in rtl and i want to ask about probable solutions for this

I am able to fix this issue by forking the "react-native-pager-view" but issue remain that mean i also have to fork  "Material Top Tabs Navigator" as i want to use my own pager view.

One more solution i come up with is to write my own library by using native scrollview.


So what you suggest what is better option. In case one i have to wait for their solution until then i just have to keep my fork repository up-to-date but complete dependency on update for rtl.
In case 2 i have to maintain my code by myself but i good side full control over code.
which is the better option according to you and why ?
