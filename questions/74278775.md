# How do I stream Cloud Build logs with the Node.js library?

Some context: Our Cloud Build process relies on manual triggers and about 8 substitutions to customize deploys to various firebase projects, hosting sites, and preview channels. Previously we used a bash script and gcloud to automate the selection of these substitution options, the "updating" of the trigger (via gcloud beta builds triggers import: our needs require us to use a single trigger, it's a long story), and the "running" of the trigger.
This bash script was hard to work with and improve, and through the import-run shenanigans actually led to some faulty deploys that caused all kinds of chaos: not great.
However, recently I found a way to pass substitution variables as part of a manual trigger operation using the Node.js library for Cloud Build (runTrigger with subs passed as part of the request)!
Problem: So I'm converting our build utility to Node, which is great, but as far as I can tell there isn't a native way to steam build logs from a running build in the console (except maybe with exec, but that feels hacky).
Am I missing something? Or should I be looking at one of the logging libraries?
I've tried my best scanning Google's docs and APIs (Cloud Build REST, the Node client library, etc.) but to no avail.
