# FreeRTOS: Is semaphore appropriate for a proxy MCU node communication?

I am currently trying to develop a proxy program that takes data from a SPI bus to tcp and vice versa. I would like to know if the method i intend to do is a good/intended way of utilising freertos library. The program is running as a SPI master with GPIO pin trigger from slave if slave wants to send data over as SPI can only be initiated from master.

char buffer1 [128];
char buffer2[128];
static QueueHandle_t rdySem1 //semaphore
static QueueHandle_t rdySem2 //semaphore
volatile atomic int GPIO_interrupt_pin;

void SPI_task(void* arg)
{
 while(1)
 {
  if (GPIO_interrupt_pin)
   {
   //TODO:read data from SPI bus and place in buffer1
   xSemaphoreGive(rdySem1);
   GPIO_interrupt_pin = 0;
   } 
 xSemaphoreTake(rdySem2, portMAX_DELAY);
 //TODO:send data from buffer2[] to SPI bus
 }
}

void tcp_task(void* arg)
{
 while(1)
 {
  int len; 
  char rx_buffer[128];
  len = recv(sock, rx_buffer, sizeof(rx_buffer) - 1, 0);
  if (len>0)
  {
   //TODO:process data from TCP socket and place in buffer2
   xSemaphoreGive(rdySem2);
  } 
 xSemaphoreTake(rdySem1, portMAX_DELAY);
 //TODO:send data from buffer1[] to TCP
 }
}

//only run when GPIO pin interrupt triggers
static void isr_handler(void* arg)
{
 GPIO_interrupt_pin = 1;
}


Also, i am not very familiar with how freeRTOS work but i believe xSemaphoreTake is a blocking call and it would not work in this context unless i use a non-blocking call version if xSemaphoreTake(). Any kind soul that can point me in the right direction? Much appreciate.
