# Is it possible to get backtrace on application exit?

I have an linux(ARM) multithread application. How can I get the backtraces (for all threads) of the app on exit (not a crash).
Note: I canâ€™t use gdb with catch syscall because of not supported architecture for this feature.
I tried to set breakpoints with gdb on exit and _exit, but no success.
