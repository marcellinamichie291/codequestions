# SEC EDGAR API to Google Sheets integration

I want to connect US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) API to Google sheet. I want to be able to upload files in JSON from SEK server to Google Sheets directly. Buy could not make any of ImportJSON functions work. It gives me 403 code error. I know that the issue has something to do with credentials/headers, as it was discussed here:
How to get data from SEC Edgar python and a json
But IDK how to implement that in Google Sheet.
Here is the page for the SEC API just in case:
https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation
Any help is much appreciated.
