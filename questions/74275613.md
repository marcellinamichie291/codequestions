# searching in postgres tsvector for something with `-` in does not work

I have a postgres tsvector label field which contains
'hello-world' 'hungry'
now we let the user search for these terms and brings them back for example they can search for explict labels..
Everytime a user tries to search with a - it does not return
does not work:
  SELECT 
    labels
  FROM tbt
  WHERE labels @@ to_tsquery('hello-world | jobs')

works:
  SELECT 
    labels
  FROM tbt
  WHERE labels @@ to_tsquery('hungry | jobs')

How can i make - work in the tsquery search as well?
I would like to achieve this in the query and not have to change any data in the tables.
thanks in advance!
