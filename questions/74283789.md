I need to access a USB drive on Linux from some older kernels like 2.6.32 to 2.6.37 or so but they don't work and it seems the issue is when the USB drive is attached on kernels that DO WORK (newer kernels), that dmesg | grep -i scsi will show messages like:
attached scsi generic sg2 Type 13
but on the older kernels I get:
attached scsi generic sg2 Type 0
(What fails is using the sg_raw command. It works fine on kernels that detect drive as "Type 13" but fails with "Fixed format, current; Sense key: Illegal Request Additional sense: Invalid command operation code" on kernels that detect it only as "Type 0")
I looked a bit at sg.c in linux kernel but it's not clear to me how much work it would be to add support to these 2.6.32 or 2.6.37 kernels so that they detect the USB drive as "Type 13"?
(no i can't simply upgrade kernel, these are embedded systems with other patches etc...)
