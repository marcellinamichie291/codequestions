Not sure if this is the right place to ask this:
How do programs written in c++ run on other computers if you don't write them specifically to do that? I saw something about not just sending the .exe, but also sending other things with it?
Is there a high level programming language that is as fast or nearly as fast (in run speed) as c++ while also being platform independent?
See above.
