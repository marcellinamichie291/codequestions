# What would be time complexity of below code that uses Python dictionary and Count function?

I'm new at figuring out time complexities and it's the area where I have the most trouble. The below code is simple but I'm trying to pin down the complexity for it. Can somebody help and elaborate?
`
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        
        dict1 = {}
        for letter in magazine:
            
            if letter not in dict1:
                dict1[letter] = magazine.count(letter)
                
        
        for letter in ransomNote:
            
            if letter not in dict1 or dict1[letter] < ransomNote.count(letter):
                return "False"
            
        return "True"

`
This is an example of "OR" statement for an "if" inside a loop.
In my calculation it is coming up to: O(m^2 * d) + O(nd + n^2) (where n = size of ransomNote, m = size of magazine, and d = size of dictionary) but that can be grossly wrong.
I calculated it like below:
for letter in magazine: #O(m)
            
            if letter not in dict1: #O(d)
                dict1[letter] = magazine.count(letter) #O(m)
                
for letter in ransomNote: #O(n)
            
            if letter not in dict1 or dict1[letter] < ransomNote.count(letter): #O(d) + O(n)
                return "False"


Any help would be appreciated.
