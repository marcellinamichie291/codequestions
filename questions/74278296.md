# Dataflow writing to datastore poor performance?

Lately I have updated my dataflow apache beam pipeline to the latest version, my pipeline writes a huge amount of data. The pipeline before apache beam version update from 2.27 to 2.41 takes about 8 min to finish executing while after the update it takes more than 30 min to finish executing.
Before the Update

After the update

The Enforce ramp-up through throttling step wasn't shown before updating the pipeline version.
