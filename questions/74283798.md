# External activity result code after viewing pdf

I'm launching an implicit intent to view a local pdf file:
private val openPdfDocument = registerForActivityResult(StartActivityForResult()) { result ->
    if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        // all good
    }
}

private fun viewDocument(file: File) {
    val context = requireContext()


    val uri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(
        context,
        context.applicationContext.packageName + ".fileprovider",
        file
    )

    val intent = Intent().apply {
        action = Intent.ACTION_VIEW
        setDataAndType(uri, "application/pdf")
        addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION)
    }

    openPdfDocument.launch(intent)
}


That opens up the pdf viewer, then I use navigation to go back to the original screen.
Problem is that resultCode results in RESULT_CANCELED.
Is there a way to check if that document viewer was successfully triggered?
Or should I just ignore that resultCode, as I don't have much control over it?
