# Can someone explain to me exactly how a collection of controls works in a panel?

(First, excuse my English, I'm French and use "Reverso" to translate)
I have a panel in which I display images (each being in a PictureBox) one after the other from left to right.
I want to be able to move one of these images to (for example) move it from 3rd to 6th place.
My program works well, in appearance, but when I want to move this image again, I realize that its PictureBox is in the '0' position of the Panel.ControlCollection and not in its original place (3) or in its new place (6).
Can someone explain to me why and, more importantly, how to avoid this problem?
Because, with my code, it then causes the displacement of the PictureBox '0'  and not the one I just changed to '6'... which is "generative".
I have not found a way to sort my Panel.ControlCollection... is it possible?
(I was hoping that would be a solution)
Thank you all

I wanted to try to sort the collection but did not find "how do" (there is no "sort(IComparer)").
I imagined using an array (copy of the collection) to manage everything and then copy it into the collection but this is very heavy and takes up a lot of resources (I can have more than 300 images to display!)
I expect a solution for the ControlCollection to reflect the display of the Panel images (the PictureBox moved to its real new position and not to '0')
