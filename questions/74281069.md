# What would be a good practice on investigating an existing Snowflake instance, using DBT?


With all the DBT and Snowflake pieces (i.e. resources, credentials, environments, etc), in place, installed, configured and properly running and

Following DBT best practices and DBT CLI framework,


how would I start a new DBT project to actually investigate the raw structures, existent views and relationships, in order to decide about the transformation layer that is possible to be created (i.e. new modules, new views, new relations and etc)?
For example, I`ve created a project, as in: "dbt-init investigation" and now, what sort of commands are available that could improve my understanding and writing of the transformation layer?
Commands, which would improve my visibility about the datamodel(s)/structure(s) available?
Best wishes,
I
