# TASK : Write a program which saves in a second file the contents of the first file without duplicates

let's suppose that we have this file :
File1 contain :
Ball,
Earth,
Planet,
Soccer,
Beach,
Ball,
Planet,
by executing the code, our second file must contain :
Ball,
Earth,
Planet,
Soccer,
Beach,
the code consists of copying in the second file the contents of the first file without duplicates
int main() {
char s1\[32\];
char s2\[32\];
FILE \*f1;
FILE \*f2;
FILE \*ff;
int temp = 1;

/\* ------------------------- */
f1 = fopen("fic1.txt", "w+r");
ff = fopen("fic1.txt", "w+r");
f2 = fopen("fic2.txt", "w+r");
/* ------------------------- \*/

while (fgets(s1, 32, f1) != NULL) { // What is the condition to stop when we hit the end of the line
fgets(s1, 32, f1);
while (fgets(s2, 32, ff) != NULL) {
if (f1 == ff) {
ff++;
} else {
fgets(s2, 32, ff);
if (strcmp(s1, s2) == 0) {
temp = temp \* 0;
} else {
temp = temp \* 1;
}
}
}
if (temp == 0) {
fprintf(f2, "%s", s1);
}
}
fclose(f1);
fclose(ff);
fclose(f2);
}

I am a beginner, sorry if the code is plenty of mistakes
Thank you
