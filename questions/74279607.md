# (Java) Reading a matrix .txt file as a spiral and writing it into Linked List

I need to read different .txt matrix's of integers and write them into Linked List. And it needs to stop when the integer is lower than zero. First, i need to write them to 2D array then change it to linked list. I can read file names so code will work for every input but I couldn't figure out how to read as a spiral. I think I could be able to do rest but still I can't read as spiral.
2 0  2  4  8 
5 1  -1 -1 3
8  2  4  1  7
I tried scanner class, I can read them normally (left to right) but still can't do the spiral.
