# Flutter Desktop MacOS: how to open a file from Finder with Flutter app

I've written a Flutter Desktop MacOS application that uses a command line argument to process a file:
void main(List<String> args) async {
  if (args.isNotEmpty) {
    runApp(MyApp(args.first))
  } else ...;
}

which works as expected when I run it from the shell:
# this command is ok:
/Applications/TommyView.app/Contents/MacOS/TommyView Pictures/hey.png

But when I assign this app to all *.png images, and want to run it from Finder, it shows:

(or sometimes another error depending on Info.plist: TommyView cannot open files in the “PNG image” format.)
I guess some magic is missing in Info.plist. Please help to figure out.
