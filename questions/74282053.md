# Remote debugging a gke pod running a java app in IntelliJ

I know this question has been asked a lot, however none of the answers are resolving my issue(s).
Steps I take:

I add -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8765 to the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS so it looks like this

- name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
          value: -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -Xms512m -Xmx1g -Xss256k -Dhttp.maxConnections=1000
            -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8765 -Dlogging.config=classpath:logback-kube.xml


I run kubectl port-forward [pod name] 8765:8765

I make a debug configuration in IntelliJ that looks like the following screenshot


run the debug configuration I just made.


This breaks on step 1. By breaks I mean the pod enters the CrashLoopBackOff state.
What am I missing? If I need to upload more info please let me know and I'll add it as soon as I can.
