# CICS Error Unable to create connection mainframe system

One of my applications is integrated with the mainframe system. Through CICS / CTG. I am facing an error while executing a request.also, i have used ASN1 encoding for request
The error I am getting while executing the request
org.springframework.dao.NonTransientDataAccessResourceException: Unable to create a connection to the remote application; nested exception is com.ibm.connector2.cics.CICSUserInputException: CTG9627E IOException occurred when writing to the Output Record
i am using
cics version : c900-20160704-0205
Does anyone have any insights about this?
