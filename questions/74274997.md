# Move one more vector to the vector of vectors?

I have the structure vector<vector<x>> a and one more vector<x> v. I need to append this new vector to the existing vector of vectors (as new a item, not to concatenate), but it is long and I do not need it afterwards, so I would like to move the contents instead:
As of the time of writing, the code is trivial:
 a.push_back(v);

that obviously works. Can this be optimized like
 a.push_back(std::move(v));

or somehow else?
