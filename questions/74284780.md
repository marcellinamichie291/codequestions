# How can i determine the sop and pos part from a combined expression

𝐹(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶, 𝐷) = (𝐷′ + 𝐴𝐵′)(𝐴𝐷 + 𝐶′)𝐵′ + 𝐵𝐷′(𝐴′ + 𝐶′) + 𝐴′
like this combined expression where SOP POS both available how can i know which are sop & which are pos?
I am trying to find the sop & pos from this combined expression but i cant. we know (𝐷′ + 𝐴𝐵′)(𝐴𝐷 + 𝐶′) ** its a pos function and its a ** 𝐷′A + 𝐴𝐵′ sop function. but i cant understand how to find from combined expressions where both sop pos are available.
