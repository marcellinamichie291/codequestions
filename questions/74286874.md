# When working with json why use json.loads?

This is not much an error I am having but I would like the reason behind the following:
For example in a tutorial page we have
json_string = """
{
    "researcher": {
        "name": "Ford Prefect",
        "species": "Betelgeusian",
        "relatives": [
            {
                "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
                "species": "Betelgeusian"
            }
        ]
    }
}
"""
data = json.loads(json_string)

Which is ok, but my question is why all the bother to put the json as a string and then call json.loads when the same thing can be obtained by
otro={
    "researcher": {
        "name": "Ford Prefect",
        "species": "Betelgeusian",
        "relatives": [
            {
                "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
                "species": "Betelgeusian"
            }
        ]
    }
}

print(type(otro))
print(otro)
print(otro==data) #True
