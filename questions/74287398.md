# Prometheus 'labels'

I need to send a specific alert to multiple channels on Slack through alertmanager via a prometheus .yml file.
At the moment my current config is one to one, meaning one alert to one channel. Therefore the alert ' vs_replica_sql_slave_status' goes to 'slack_monitoring_prod'
prometheus.yml:
groups:
      - name: vs_replica_sql_slave_status
        rules:
           - alert: vs_slave_status
             for: 2m
             expr: (mysql_global_status_slave_running{instance=~"vs-replica.+",alias!~"vs-replica-test",alia
             labels:
               severity: "critical"
             annotations:
                     identifier: "{{ $labels.alias }}"
                     description: "Slave Status not running"

alertmanager.yml:
 routes:
  - match:
      severity: critical
    receiver: slack_monitoring_prod

I need to send the alert to another channel as well which is:
- match:
      severity: critical_dwh
    receiver: critical_dwh

In the first block of code I have labels > severity > critical which points to first channel. Is it possible to add another label that will point to the second channel or will this break the whole config? i.e:
labels:
   severity: "critical"
   severity: "critical_dwh"

Any suggestion or methods on how to perform this would be greatly appreciated.
