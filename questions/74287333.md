# React - show two elelments on button click

I have a stackblitz here
I know I'm not meant to ask this but is there a better way of doing this.
I have two divs that are positioned on tpo of each other and two buttons to show each of the divs
I'm using useState and updating it on button click <button onClick={() => setBlock('One')}>Btn One</button>
and then show the div based on the useState value.
{block === 'One' && <div className="FlexContainerColOne"></div>}

I'm asking cos I've never seen like this before block === 'One' `and not sure if this the best way to do this
