So i am making a password protected note taking app and discovered a problem.
(This question is about encrypting plain text using custom plain text as key)
In the process of encrypting and decrypting we need a key, and the key is auto generated. But the auto generated key is large and complex for the user to understand or remember.
So when we ask the user for a password, how do we decrypt or encrypt the note using the password?
I tried making my own encryption algorithm, it worked but i dont think thats secure enough, and messes up if using the some special characters in the note
My custom encryption algorithm is something like the algorithm that replaces a character with something a few steps away from the ordinate of the character
