# WHERE query in JPQL is not translating to correct native query

The complex WHERE query with OR condition is not translated correctly to native query
JPQL query condition:
WHERE i.id = :id AND ( (i.group = 1 ) OR (i.group != 1 and i.orderDate > :todaysDate))  

is being translated as
where item.id=? 

    and (
        item.group=1 
        or item.group<>1 
        and item.due_date>?
    )
    

We can observe that the second condition of AND is not being evaluated in correct order. How to deal with complex where queries in JPQL
Instead i believe it should ideally would have been
where item.id=? 

    and (
        item.group=1 
        or 
     (item.group<>1 
        and item.due_date>?)
    )
