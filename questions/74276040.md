# Rubymine Debbug does not stop at breakpoint and passes test

Debbug in Rubymine started to annoy me today out of nowhere. Rubymine was no updated btw, my current version is 2022.2.3. Although I put a breakpoint on the given line, where I want to check for example variables, the debbuger does not build, but continues to perform the test as if nothing. The debugger window opens for just a second, but immediately closes itself and shows the test result. Everything has worked fine for me so far. Does anyone know what to do with it please? Thank you in advance. :)
I tried going through the debugger settings, but I couldn't find this problem anywhere.
