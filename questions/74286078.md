# Trying to open custom domain from another device to ubuntu apache2

Using Ubuntu 22.04 as the machine. already changing the /etc/hosts and making new domain.com.conf on /apache2/sites-available/ already check the connection between my ubuntu and my other device. But still need open it with 192.168.1.7:8080 to open it from other device, not with my custom domain. How to fix this?(but can open it on my ubuntu with domain.com:8080)
/etc/hosts/
`
192.168.1.7 localhost
192.168.1.7 domain.com
192.168.1.7 www.domain.com
`

/etc/apache2/sites-available/domain.com.conf
`
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.:8080>
ServerName www.bpguestbook.local

ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
DocumentRoot /var/www/html
