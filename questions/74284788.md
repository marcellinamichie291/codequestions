# Trying to convert Multiple Py File into One EXE File PYQT5

I am trying to convert multiple py files ( main.py check.py free.py) into one exe file. I am using PYQT5.
I have tired using AUTO PY TO EXE and I am not able to convert multiple file into 1 exe file. I have tried adding path to Additional Files but no luck still. It does give me 1 file but however the functionaly doesn't work since it needs all py file to function accordingly.
Is there any other way to convert PYQT5 multiple files into 1 exe file.
Tried to use Auto-Py-To-Exe with no luck convert multipel files into 1 exe file.
