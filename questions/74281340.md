# How do I set(repeatedly) a Foreign Key Model, on multiple fields in another Model ? + Django

Trying to build a Model -> Trip, with multiple Hotel entries per region -> denoted by variables _pb, _hv, _nl.
class Trip(models.Model):
    hotel_pb = models.ForeignKey(Hotel, on_delete=models.PROTECT, blank=True)
    hotel_hv = models.ForeignKey(Hotel, on_delete=models.PROTECT, blank=True)
    hotel_nl = models.ForeignKey(Hotel, on_delete=models.PROTECT, blank=True)

How do I achieve this without creating region specific Hotel models ?

I have tried using the same Foreignkey, but throws error.
