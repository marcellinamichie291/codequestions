How does the "this" keyword work, and when should it be used?

Here is a simple snippet:


class A {
  constructor(func) {
    func();
  }
}

class B {
  constructor() {
    this.field = "hello";
    new A(this.printField);
  }

  printField() {
    console.log(this.field);
  }
}

new B();



I would expect "hello" to be printed. However, I get the following error:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'field')

It seems that after passing printField, this is now referring to A instead of B. How can I fix it?
Edit:
Yes, yes, I know. When copying the snippet I accidentally wrote new A(printField) instead of new A(this.printField). The question and the error I get are now fixed.
