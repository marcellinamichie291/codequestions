# Neat algorithm, weird distance results when using crossover for breeding

I'm trying to implement neat algorithm from scratch in golang and it does not work properly for now.
The problem is that when I run my implementation, genomes mutation are goods and calculation too, but all species scores are stuck around 0.50 and are not doing anything.
I tried to debug it but can't find where the problem is. The only weird thing I've found is the Distance between the representative of a specie and a new genome created when breeding is sometimes really high.
If my interpretation is good, when breeding a new genome from random specie members, the new genome should be a member of this specie and have a low distance from members of this specie no ?
Do you think that my distance method is completely broken or is it normal to have these results ?
Thanks !
