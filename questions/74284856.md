Iam working on a LED (light emitting diode) tracking to capture various stance position of an Archer through multiple cameras to get xyz axis, detection is perfect using HSV Mask in open cv but problems are with tracking cetroid tracking, tracker switches ids of countours while tracking is their any other perfect algoritham which can track with trajectory perfectly and handle occulsions? it's not a neural network detection will you people suggest deepsort will work on it
