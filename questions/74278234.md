# How to change pages using a function in React

When a user logs in and clicks the button, a function is called and this function calls a function that returns a Promise. When the user logs in, the href property is responsible for changing pages. I need to change the page inside the function login though because I tried using a ternary on the href, but it does not wait for the function that returns a Promise to be returned.
My purpose is to change to the /dashboard page after the access token is brought
Function login:
 const login = async () => {
        const response = await LoginService({email, password})
        if (response.access_token) {
            setReturned(true)
            console.log('ACCESS TOKEN IS RETURNED')
           } else {
            throw new Error('NO ACCESS TOKEN')
        }

    }

                       




<Button color='primary' onClick={login} className='btn-next' block href={'/dashboard'} >
                                Login
 </Button>
