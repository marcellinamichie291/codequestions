I have a system to send user statements in .html file fomat as an attachment to the email. Mostof the users views statemenst through the Gmail app in the mobile applciation. The issue is to view those .html statmenst in iPhones.
After saving the .html file to the file location in mobile and when trying to view them, the file displayed without any values rendered. So they need to use a third-party HTML viewer application where the values get rendered. but in Android when you try to open the file it will ask for an option to view it in the mobile browser.
Is there any workaround to view those .html attachments without the use of any third-party applications on iPhone.
I tried a sample .html file with a click event as an email attachment and tried to click the button to trigger the browser through a button click while the statement opens inside the Gmail app and after that from the saved location. both the time the button click didn't work on iPhone. only it worked when I opened it through the HTML viewer.
Is there any option to make this process easy than using the third part app viewer applications?
