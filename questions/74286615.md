# Is there project webhook event that triggers on project update such as change project name in gitlab like github and bitbucket

I was trying to fetch project updates (eg. change name of project or group) through webhook in gitlab but i am not able to get changes that i made in project name or group name.
I tried in github and bitbucket there I am able to get repository changes through repository webhook event, is there any event that supports project changes.
