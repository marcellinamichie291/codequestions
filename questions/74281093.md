# getting the span text from bs4

I have a number of text items contained in span tags that i need to extract.
I am able to do this in a list comp in the class table-main__odds as shown. I need to get the same info fronm the table-main__odds coloured tag. The logic below does not return any values. any help is appreciated?
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://www.betexplorer.com/soccer/england/premier-league/results/'
soup = BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).content)
odds_raw = soup.find_all("td", class_="table-main__odds")
fav_odds_raw = soup.find_all("td",class_="table-main__odds colored")


odds = [o.get('data-odd') for o in odds_raw]


the desired result is a list with the values contained here in data-odd
