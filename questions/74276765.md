# Is there a simple way to parse a line of Tcl into its command and its arguments (not just splitting by whitespace)

Suppose I have a string which is also a Tcl command.
set line {lsort -unique [list a b c a]}

How can I convert this string into a list equivalent to this?
  {
      {lsort}
      {-unique}
      {[list a b c a]}
  }

Because of whitespace inside the square brackets, I can't just use lindex.
For example:
> lindex $line 2
   -->  [list

The reason I'm asking is because I have a large Tcl script that I want to parse and re-write.  I would like certain lines in the re-written script to have swapped argument order or some numerical arguments scaled by a factor.
I know I could parse the string character by character, keeping track of {}, [], and " characters, but this feels like re-inventing something that might already exist.    I've been looking at the info and interp commands but couldn't find anything there.
