# Python - bug - deleting elements from a list

In an exercise I'm supposed to have a program that asks for multiple inputs and the program should delete the largest and smallest n numbers.
My attempt:

def outliers(lst, n):

    new = sorted(lst)

    for i in range(0, n):
        del new[i]
        del new[len(new) - i - 1]

    return new

def main():
    lst = []
    n = int(input("Enter a non-zero number: "))
    while n != 0:
        lst.append(n)
        n = int(input("Enter a non-zero number: "))

    print(f"the list without the 2 outliers are: {outliers(lst, 2)}")

main()


Bug:
Enter a non-zero number: 1
Enter a non-zero number: 2
Enter a non-zero number: 5
Enter a non-zero number: 8
Enter a non-zero number: 9
Enter a non-zero number: 0
the list without the 2 outliers are: [8]

Process finished with exit code 0

The program should return a list [5]. I tried to run parts of the program, i know the error must be that for loop that I'm using. But it seems correct to me. Can someone tell me why it's not working the way it should?
