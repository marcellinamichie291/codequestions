# UnknownHostException while trying to reach domain through proxy

I am trying to reach out to a domain from intellij through spring boot server. I am using proxy to reach it.
I have configured the HTTP proxy settings for the intellij. Checked the connection for domain and was successful. But when I try to reach same domain with app-server, it gives me Unknown Host Exception. Can someone guide me onto what might be the issue?
