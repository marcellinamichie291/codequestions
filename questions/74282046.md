# How can I protect a credentials file using .htaccess

I am working on an old project.
The database credentials are stored as JSON in web root in a file like .my_secret and configurations are stored in .my_config - A PHP script reads these files and uses the data for connecting to the database and retrieving other settings.
If someone tries to access this file, I want to throw a 404 error, file not found.
How can I do this using only .htaccess? I don't want to use .htpasswd
I tried to move the files outside the web root, but I encountered an open_basedir restriction in effect
