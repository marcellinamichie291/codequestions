# When trying to sum up the time in excel (though format cell has been set to [h]:mm;), it shows wrong result

I was trying to calculte my stuff's office hour in excel. There are three of them. First of all, I subtracted the arrival time from the departure time and found out their daily active work hours. Then I summded up their daily hours individually and formatted the cells to [h]:mm. Then I noticed two among these three calculations are right. But one of them showing a wrong result. Please help me.
The result '4507' is the wrong one. I summed the work hours manually. It should be around 260 hours.
