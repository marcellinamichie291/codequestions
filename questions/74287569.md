# Predicting missing letters in a word

I am stuck with this machine learning problem.
For input, we have a word in which some letters are missing, e.g., word = 'in---m-nt'. Then we can make up to 6 guesses.
guess1 = 'e', then word = 'in--ement'
guess2 = 'a', then word = 'in--ement'
guess3 = 'x', then word = 'in--ement'
guess4 = 'c', then word = 'inc-ement'
guess5 = 'r', then word = 'increment'
succeed!
Or
guess5 = 'k', then word = 'inc-ement'
guess6 = 'x, then word = 'inc-ement'
Fail!
We are supposed to train a model to achieve highest success probability.
This seems like a reinforcement learning problem, which unfortunately I am not very familiar with.
I am relatively familiar with CNN in NLP, but I couldn't think of what the training data structure looks like.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
