# How to export as pdf with markdown content in asp.net core mvc?

Here my existing code,
[ServiceFilter(typeof(ValidationPaymentDoneFilter))]
public IActionResult export(string code)
{
    string[] scode = code.Split("--");

    Boards Boards = new Boards();
    Boards.Code = scode[0];

    BoardRepository BoardRepository = new BoardRepository();
    Boards = BoardRepository.GetBoardDetailbyCode(Boards);
    List<Sections> srchlst = BoardRepository.GetSectionsDetails(Boards);

    ViewModel mymodel = new ViewModel();
    mymodel.Boards = Boards;
    mymodel.Sections = srchlst;

    return new ViewAsPdf("ExportAsPDF", mymodel);
}

Can anyone please help here ?
Thanks in advance
