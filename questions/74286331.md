# Discover wired cameras on DVR through IP or network

I recently installed 2 CCTV cameras in my office, these cameras are wired and connected to a DVR(Digital Video Recorder) which is connected to the internet through LAN. Is there any way I could get camera information and video streams from the DVR using the IP of the DVR???
I tried entering the IP of the DVR in RSTP protocol format in my browser E.g rstp://100.223.xx.xxx, and I got one stream, but i want both streams(if possible, in Spring boot environment).  Thanks
