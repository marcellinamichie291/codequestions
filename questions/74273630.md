# Node.js in ubuntu is not working as I want

I AM USING UBUNTU
I have written code in Node.js for organising directory. For example, download directory is always messed up and I want to sort all the files in it based on there extension.
when I run my program from vs code terminal (in my case : bash) , it is working fine .But I want to create a global command to run these functionalities. So , in package.json i code this:
"bin":{
    "himanshu":"main.js"
  }

Then I did npm link: it worked with no errors.
But
my global command is not working :
**himanshu1856@potato:~$ himanshu help
himanshu: command not found
himanshu1856@potato:~$ **
I don't know what is going wrong.
Before npm link was not working.
Then I followed this blog step by step.
