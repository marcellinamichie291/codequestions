# Issue with php and apache define tmp dirs

we have standard php and apache but not seeing anything in there defined tmp dirs
I have actually 2 issues one is routing logs for https://www.test.com
other is that the '/tmp/' or our dev on system currently is writing to a private system dir
e.g. /tmp/systemd-private-840c0bc8008041628bfc86e69a7bb944-httpd.service-z3oDEZ/tmp/
our old server wrote to '/tmp/' without the 'systemd-...' additions
The issue with the '/tmp' directory storing things to private directories based on service executing the request rather than the. '/tmp' root. Do anyone help me how can resolve that?
How to check logs for non application 500s?
We have CRONs that require static tmp dir is there a way to have the tmp be created consistently
Aftere go through some article like
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/security.html
So i understand that '/etc/systemd/system/[name-goes-here].service.d/config_name.conf' should not already exist.
That file doesn't exist on our old server and the 'tmp' issue isn't present there is there some other way this is configured/can be?
any short of help would be apricated ?
