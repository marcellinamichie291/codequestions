# Haskell data type in list

I have a data type which looks like this:
data Vector3 = V Int Int Int deriving (Eq, Show)


And I have to write this function:
vectorListSum :: [vector3] -> vector3


Which should sum the parameters on the same index, so:
(V1 a1 b1 c1) + (V2 a2 b2 c2) => (V3 a1+a2 b1+b2 c1+c2)
And so on, depending on how many elements the list have
I tried something like this:
vectorListSum :: [vector3] -> vector3
vectorListSum [] = V 0 0 0
vectorListSum ((V a b c):xs) = ...


But I couldn't go any further
