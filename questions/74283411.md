# Methods for searching for people with similar purchasing habits in big data with a given person as the base

I'm looking at finding people with similar purchasing behaviors with a given person or group as a starting point for a market research problem.
I'm going to use vectors and represent every person and their habits as a vector and then compare these vectors to return the base person or group. I'd probably use Faiss. I believe KNN can be used too.
But I'm looking to see is if I can use other methods such as clustering methods like k-means clustering for such a question, and with the presence of a given person or group as the base. I thought the only way clustering algs would work is to first cluster the data, then return the group that the 'base person or group' falls into. However, this would be costly and probably not very accurate. But potentially this technique can be used to reduce the search space.
So, do you know of any other ways? (non-Machine Learning or Information Retrieval methods would be welcomed too :) )
