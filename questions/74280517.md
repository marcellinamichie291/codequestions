# Project 1 - how to come up with the boolean expression?

I just started taking the course, and I have a general question.
In the first project we're required to build a few logic gates and I seem to have a problem with it.
I do understand how to write the hdl files and the syntax, but I'm having trouble realizing the gates' structures. With the simple gates like And and OR it's quite simple (especially with the given Nand gate), but with the more complex ones (like mux) I feel like I'm just shooting bullets in the air without a direction.
How am I supposed to come up with a correct implementation from the truth table?
Am I supposed to use dnf and then simplify the long expression? Cause I tried it to no avail (couldn't find a way to simplify it).
Sorry if it was a bit unclear but can someone please give me a pointer regarding how to "attack"
this sort of problems?
Thanks and have a great rest of week!
