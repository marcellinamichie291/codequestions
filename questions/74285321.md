# How to configure Eclipse to debug with docker and gdb?

With following setup:

ubuntu VM, running eclipse C/C++ IDE
ubuntu 16.04 docker container with PTXdist build system and gcc toolchain
source code in VM filesystem mounted to docker container
remote target connected via SSH

What works and what not:

PTXdist: build project from command line - OK, works
make: build project from command line - OK, works
gdb: from command line - attach to binary in running container works
eclipse:

debug configuration calls python script which executes docker gdb in running container
FAILED with timeout on gdb version



It looks like the gdb machine interface is not reachable from eclipse while checking the gdb version (as a connection test?).
Already tried to attach STDIN,STDOUT to the container, but without success.
Does anyone have a hint to configure this setup?
P.S. The next step will be to switch from ubuntu VM to Windows 10 (with Docker Desktop + WSL2)
