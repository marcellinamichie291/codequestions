I hate how my school website looks and there's no notification when another task pops up, so I want to make a user interface that gets data from this website and then refreshes daily to see what's new. The website is not aesthetically nice so I'm making this. Is this possible with only javascript? If so, how do I approach this?
I'm learning from freeCodeAmp.org but it would be nice to hear from people's experience regarding javascript and web scraping and to apply their knowledge in my coding instead.
