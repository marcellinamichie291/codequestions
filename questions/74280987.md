# How to listen to a TCP stream on my FastAPI server

I am working on a project building an API that is able to send the live location of vehicles to a frontend.
I get this location data by subscribing to a ZMQ stream by running a while loop. This is all working and if I just run my stream as a script I can print all kinds of information to the terminal (I'll store those in a database later on).
I also have the FastAPI server up and running
Now what I'd like to do is:

At startup start the server so I can make API calls
Start the while loop and start receiving data from the ZMQ stream

What happens instead:

It seems either / or.
I can import a function with the while loop but this blocks the server from starting up
Or I can run the server with no means to start the stream

Here is my code:
# General FastAPI Imports
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, Request
from data_collection.livestream import enable_data_stream
from client_service import client_api

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(client_api.router, prefix="/API/V1")
@app.get('/')
def read_root(request: Request):
    return {"Hello": "World"}


The Stream:

from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO
import zmq
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET




context = zmq.Context()
subscriber = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
subscriber.connect("tcp://SERVER")
subscriber.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE)

while True:
    multipart = subscriber.recv_multipart()
    address = multipart[0]
    try:
        contents = GzipFile('', 'r', 0, BytesIO(multipart[1])).read()
        root = ET.fromstring(contents)
        print("Updates Received:")
        # Gets the timestamp
        print('time', root[3].text)
        print('X Coord: ', root[4][0][12].text)
        print('Y Coord: ', root[4][0][13].text)

I tried looking into the multiprocess and threading implementations for python but I'm unsure how those tie in with starting the FastAPI process (as that's enabled from Uvicorn)
