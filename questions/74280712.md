# How to create a PDF and open it using Flutter web

I am currently at the end of my application and I want to export all the data I have collected from the user and put it neatly into a PDF that they then can either print or download and send off. I have tried using a couple of PDF dependencies but none seem to be web friendly. Anyone done this before and possibly point me in a good direction?
