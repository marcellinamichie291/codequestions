# Not able to configure any URLs in Django; going to localhost:8000 shows the congratulations page

As title - I've been going through the official tutorial (part 1) and have gotten to the point where we  wire an index view into the URLConf. However, when I run python manage.py runserver I only see the "congratulations! the installation was successful!" page, not the HTTPResponse that's supposed to return. It says that I haven't configured urls, but there are like 3 steps to follow so far and I'm confused on how I managed to go wrong when copying some code into views.py and creating a urls.py file. Going to localhost:8000/polls gives me 404 not found error.
I made sure to create urls.py within the "polls" directory (which in turn is within the project "mysite" directory); the `view.py
My urls.py code is as follows:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path(' ', views.index, name='index'),
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

My views.py code is as follows:
from django.http import HttpResponse
    
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")

When I do python manage.py runserver, I'm inside the mysite directory (that contains the polls and mysite apps' directories). I'm really not sure where I might be going wrong; any help is appreciated. Thank you!
