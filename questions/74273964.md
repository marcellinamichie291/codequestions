# Javascript code to prevent special characters in otp input fields

Hi I have the following javscript code.I am trying to add the event codes from 48 to 57 for the special characters (! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ).so that nothing happens in the text fields when typed.
    $(window).keydown(function (event) {
        if (event.keyCode == 116 || event.keyCode == 93 || event.keyCode == 33 ||
            event.keyCode == 34 || event.keyCode == 123 || event.keyCode == 154 ||
            event.keyCode == 82 || event.keyCode == 17 || event.keyCode === 38 ||
            event.keyCode === 40 || event.keyCode === 13 ||
            event.keyCode == 48 || event.keyCode == 49 || event.keyCode == 50 ||
            event.keyCode == 51 || event.keyCode == 52 || event.keyCode == 53 ||
            event.keyCode == 54 || event.keyCode == 55 || event.keyCode === 56 ||
            event.keyCode === 57
         ) {
            event.preventDefault();
            return false;
        }
    });

The above code is not working for event codes 48 to 57. Whenever I try to type the special character in the input field am getting the number in the input fields
! for 1
@ for 2 
# for 3 
$ for 4
% for 5 
^ for 6
& for 7
* for 8
( for 9
) for 0

I am trying to find the solution and learn in the process. Thanks.
