# Copying from closed workbooks to single workbook Excel VBA

I have two separate workbooks called export.csv and export1.csv. They both got the same header. And they are dynamic ( these a job lists they are subject to change due to some jobs are closing during the day and some jobs are new and will be dropped in during the day). I'm exporting these .csv from corporate app manually.
I need to copy the information from both closed .csv workbooks into separate pre-existing workbook ( Programmer) in particular sheet called "export".
I have found a solution in internet which works for copying only one .csv into my sheet.
The bad thing is that this code just copies the data from new .CSV and inputs into my sheet when I also need to compare data from .csv to data which stored in workbook "programmer" and copy from .csv to "programmer" only what is new on  .csv.
Sub ExportData()

    ' Get workbook...
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim filter As String
    Dim targetWorkbook As Workbook, wb As Workbook
    Dim sourceworkbook As Workbook
    Dim lRow As Long
    
    Dim LastRow As Long
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    Set targetWorkbook = ActiveWorkbook 'ThisWorkbook
    Set sourceworkbook = Workbooks.Open("C:\Users\export1.csv") 
    Set sht = Sheets(1) 
    
    
    
    lRow = sht.Cells(sht.Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row 
    sht.Range("A2:AC" & lRow).Copy targetWorkbook.Sheets("Export").Range("A2") 
    sourceworkbook.Close
    
    Set ws = Sheets("Export")
    
    
    LastRow = targetWorkbook.Sheets("Export").Range("A" & ws.Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
With ws.Range("A2:A" & LastRow)
    If WorksheetFunction.CountBlank(.Cells) > 0 Then
        .SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks).EntireRow.Delete
    End If
End With

Application.ScreenUpdating = True

End Sub
