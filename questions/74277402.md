# How to override the default formfield for a read only foreign keys field in Django ModelAdmin?

I am overriding the default formfield of foreign keys on ModelAdmins as described here. However, I am not overriding it to return a subset, but instead to defer fields in order to optimize the performance. For example:
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == "car":
            kwargs["queryset"] = Car.objects.only("name")
        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)

It works for most of my use cases, but the problem occurres when the foreign key is set as a read only field. While debugging, I noticed that when it is set as read only, the field is never passed through formfield_for_foreignkey method and the query retrieving the foreign key selects all fields instead of only the necessary ones. In my case, some of the fields are too big causing an unecessary terrible performance.
I also tried the second method described in the docs, using ModelForm.__init__(), but it is not really useful for my use case.
