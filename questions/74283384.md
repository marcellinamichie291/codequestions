# Github Enterprise pull rebase "bad object" on tag push

Recently, when trying to push tags to our remote hosted in a Github Enterprise environment (via git push --tags), we received the error remote: fatal: bad object refs/__gh__/pull/X/rebase (where X is some PR number).
I am assuming __gh__ holds some refs internal to Github. Has anyone seen this before? If so, what's the remedy? We're uncertain how things got into this state. The PR referenced in the error is about 1 year old and only recently started causing problems.
Any ideas?
