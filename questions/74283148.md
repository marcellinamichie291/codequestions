# Avoid unncessary relationship Rest Api Response JPA

I have a springboot Application with 10 Tables in my database. When i make a get request on one table,  it returns a response with in all the tables having any related records in all the 10 tables. I use Lazy fetch, the problems does not solve. I need to return only response  expectated by front end app. For example, if the client wants only students then the REST API should return only students (not its child entities). How can i solve this problem.
