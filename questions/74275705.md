# Nuxt 3 / Vuetify 3 - How to import Material Icons?

I am trying to setup Material Design Icons, and I have the following config:
nuxt.config.ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt';
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss'],
    css: ['vuetify/lib/styles/main.sass', '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.min.css'],
    build: {
        transpile: ['vuetify'],
    },
    vite: {
        define: {
            'process.env.DEBUG': false,
        },
    },
})`
```

But in terminal I am keep getting the same message whatever I try
[Vue Router warn]: No match found for location with path "/materialdesignicons.min.css.map"
I installed @mdi/font package and followed the vuetify3 official docs but no success.
Also, I have installed Nuxt 3 and Vuetify 3, and dev dependencies sass-loader and sass.
Icons are shown, no problems with display in <v-icon> tag but in terminal I keep getting the same error message.
I have been Googling a lot but I can't seem to find the answer.
Any ideas? Thanks
