# How to array SUM by category

Would it be possible to array the following conditions?




Column A
Column BI
Column BK




1
10
20


1
10



2
100
20


2
-30



2
-50





I previosly asked for the formula to sum if the value in column A are the same, which I got it but I still need to drag it down on every rows.
=IF(A2=A1,"",SUMIFS(B$2:B$12,A$2:A$12,A2)) 
Which the results will appear as I wanted:
ID  Value   Sum
1   5   15
1   10  blank
2   5   30
2   10  blank
2   15  blank
3   10  35
3   10  blank
3   15  blank

I also, got the solution where for the array:
=arrayformula(if(len(A2:A),ifna(vlookup(row(A2:A),query({row(A2:B),A2:B},"select min(Col1),sum(Col3) where Col2 is not null group by Col2"),2,false)),))

But it only seems to work if I only have 2 columns of data (A and B), but my data is far apart.
I tried to adjust the formula, but it doesn't seems to work correctly.
