# Structure definition in C convert to VB.NET

I am trying to call an unmanaged function for which I have documentation in C. I also have the C header file. It uses a large number of nested struct's that I am converting to Structure objects for VB.NET. In the callback delegate it sends a void* which I use to copy over to my Structure using Marshal.PtrToStructure. However, the result gives nearly everything as zeros so obviously I am not doing it correctly.
The structures are defined as:
typedef struct tagNET_TIME_EX
{
    DWORD               dwYear;                 // Year
    DWORD               dwMonth;                // Month
    DWORD               dwDay;                  // Date
    DWORD               dwHour;                 // Hour
    DWORD               dwMinute;               // Minute
    DWORD               dwSecond;               // Second
    DWORD               dwMillisecond;          // Millisecond
    DWORD               dwUTC;                  // utc query: zero means invaild, non-zero means vaild;  set:invalid
    DWORD               dwReserved[1];          // reserved data
} NET_TIME_EX,*LPNET_TIME_EX;

and
typedef struct tagDEV_EVENT_FACERECOGNITION_INFO
{
    int                 nChannelID;                     // ChannelId
    char                szName[128];                        // event name
    int                 nEventID;                       // event ID
    NET_TIME_EX         UTC;                            // the event happen time
    DH_MSG_OBJECT       stuObject;                      // have being detected object
   ...snip...

When I use the PtrToStructure, nearly everything after szName is 0.
Why is the UTC field declared as NET_TIME_EX instead of tagNET_TIME_EX? As far as I understand, the first is an instance while the second is a type. Should not the second structure be defined as:
typedef struct tagDEV_EVENT_FACERECOGNITION_INFO
{
    int                 nChannelID;                     // ChannelId
    char                szName[128];                        // event name
    int                 nEventID;                       // event ID
    tagNET_TIME_EX          UTC;                            // the event happen time
    DH_MSG_OBJECT       stuObject;                      // have being detected object
   ...snip...

Such types of declarations are used at multiple places and perhaps that's what's causing the problem.
