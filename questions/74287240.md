I have a list where i want to remove all first articles:
["the house", "the beautiful garten", "the beautiful garten of the house"]
and i want the list to only contain:
["house", "beautiful garten", "beautiful garten of the house"]
If the first word is an article, then remove. In case the articles appears in the sentence, they should be kept.
