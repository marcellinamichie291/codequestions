# How to add boundary borderline of an area on google map

I want to automate an whole area with property borderlines, I have their property map, but don't know co-ordinates that I can genarte polygons autometically. I want something or exactly something like this site:

You can see there is actually borders between every property, i guess this can be a transperent image on map or they manually create all the things. Whagever, what do you think. Or can i have this kind of data to make those polygones?
