# List of possible fonts that poppler can read

I'm doing a search on some fonts and I'm interested in getting a list of all the possible fonts that a software like popppler can handle. Analyzing the source code of the latter, I found that it uses the fontconfig library (also used by pdffonts to find the various fonts used in a pdf file) for understanding fonts.
But now, I'm not able to obtain a "hard coded" list of fonts from this.
