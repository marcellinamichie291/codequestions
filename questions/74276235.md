# Accessing a VM on a VMware EXSi hosted on a OVHcloud server

On my OVHcloud server, I had the opportunity to install VMware ESXi 7.0.3 directly. I can access it through the web UI and I could create my first VM, which is a simple Ubuntu server. This server has a local IP address, and I can access to it through the ESXi web UI.
Now I want to be able to access it directly with SSH, without using the ESXi web UI. I imagine I need to set up a route, like setting the port 9997 of the machine to route to the Ubuntu server VM local IP. Unfortunately I can't figure how to do it on VMware ESXi UIâ€¦ Any help you be appreciated.
I have tried to find the routing settings, without success.
