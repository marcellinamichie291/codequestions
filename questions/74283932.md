# GitHub Action to Review Status Checks

Is there a way from a GitHub Action against a PR to review the status of checks against the PR?
I have a number of CI actions setup against my PRs and depending on which pass or fail, I want to act accordingly.
For example, if I have two actions ci-1 and ci-2 on my PR, I want to check if ci-1 or ci-2 passed of failed so I can then take remedial actions.
I tried checking the API but could not find anything relevant.
