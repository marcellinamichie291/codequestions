# I want to change my categorical variables into numeric form using get_dummies function by using for loop on categorical columns

I have dataset which have categorical and numeric features . I want to convert my categorical features into numeric form using for loop which iterate through only categorical variables and convert them into numeric form.
I tried this
for i in df_balanced.columns[:-1]:

    if (df_balanced[i].dtype == 'object'):
        df_new = pd.get_dummies(i[:], columns=i[:],  drop_first = True)


but it gives me empty dataframe
