# Stacking jagged array with non-jagged arrays with numpy or tensorflow

I have the following array, toStackArray that holds 3 arrays with the shapes shown below
[(2,), (4,), (2, 158, 5)]

as shown, it can be inferred that the array at indexes 0 and 1 are jagged arrays while the array at index 3 is not.
Conventionally, if all the arrays were jagged, an numpy hstack on toStackArray would return an array with the shape of (8,). (results in a join on the 1st axis)
although because the array on the 3rd index is a non-jagged array, I get the following error:
ValueError: all the input arrays must have the same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 1 dimension(s), and the array at index 2 has 3 dimension(s)

How would one tackle this in the most efficient way? (Either by numpy or tensorflow)
