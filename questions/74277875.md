# Extracting data from list with RegExp OR in Python3

I have the following list
['Amount', 'amount', 'Line Total', 'lineTotal', 'AMOUNT DUE']

and I'm trying to extract 'Amount', 'amount', 'Line Total', 'lineTotal' but not 'AMOUNT DUE' field from that list.
Here is how I do that:
>>> lst = ['Amount', 'amount', 'Line Total', 'lineTotal', 'AMOUNT DUE']
>>> import re
>>> r = re.compile("(line*|amount\b)", re.IGNORECASE)

I'm using regexp OR expression because in real use case I can have different values (e.g. in one of them can be only 'Amount' value and smth else, in the other one - 'Line Total' etc) and I want to extract exactly that one value depending on what I have.
So in example above I expect to get
['Amount', 'amount', 'Line Total', 'lineTotal']

But instead I'm getting
>>> list(filter(r.match, lst))
['Line Total', 'lineTotal']

Why is it happaning like so I how could I fix that? Thank you in advance!
