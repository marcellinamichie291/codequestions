# Should a neo4j driver be reused between transactions?

The example Node.js file for neo4j contains the following:
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver')

const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, neo4j.auth.basic(user, password))
const session = driver.session()
const personName = 'Alice'

try {
  const result = await session.run(
    'CREATE (a:Person {name: $name}) RETURN a',
    { name: personName }
  )

  const singleRecord = result.records[0]
  const node = singleRecord.get(0)

  console.log(node.properties.name)
} finally {
  await session.close()
}

// on application exit:
await driver.close()

It makes sense that a session should be created for each transaction and destroyed afterwards, but should the driver be closed between transactions in production as well?
On the one hand, I assume that there's a good bit of overhead associated with spinning up a driver instance, so doing so on each request might cause performance issues. On the other hand, I haven't seen any documentation indicating that the driver will be closed after a certain period of time, and I don't want to just have these hanging processes left behind even after the user has navigated away from the site.
Any guidance on a performant way to balance these things would be appreciated. If anyone has any production instances of how they use neo4j that would be very helpful to link to as well.
