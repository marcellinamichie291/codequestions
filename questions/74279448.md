# Node App working on localhost but not on Heroku

A Node App which is working perfectly fine on localhost but right when I deploy it to heroku it's showing me an Application Error (I've included mongodb and twilio as well)
Can anyone please help me out!?
I'm describing the problem in deep.
First I created a node app and added mongodb and deployed it to heroku, worked perfectly fine. But when I added twilio to it, worked on localhost but showing application error on Heroku.
