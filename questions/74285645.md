I have 2 Sheets "DataEntry" & "Result". I am using Worksheet Function  Xlookup to display values in column G of "Result" Sheet.
Lookup value is in column D of "Result" Sheet
Lookup array is in column F of "DataEntry" Sheet
Result array is in column I of "DataEntry" Sheet
The vba code I have ised is as follows:
Sub WorksheetFunctionsXlookupMacro()
Dim shDataEntry As Worksheet
Dim shResult As Worksheet
Dim indx As Integer
Dim lastRow As Integer
Set shDataEntry = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("DataEntry")
Set shResult = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Result")
lastRow = shResult.Cells(Rows.Count, 4).End(xlUp).Row
For indx = 3 To lastRow

shResult.Range("G" & indx).Value = WorksheetFunction.XLookup(shResult.Range("D" & indx).Value,     shDataEntry.Range("F6:F28"), shDataEntry.Range("I6:I28"))
Next
End Sub

I want to use Worksheet Function Xlookup for multiple criteria to display vales in column G of Result Sheet
Lookup value1 is in column D of "Result" Sheet
Lookup value2 is in column E of "Result" Sheet
Lookup value3 is in column F of "Result" Sheet
Lookup array1 is in column F of "DataEntry" Sheet
Lookup array2 is in column G of "DataEntry" Sheet
Lookup array3 is in column H of "DataEntry" Sheet
