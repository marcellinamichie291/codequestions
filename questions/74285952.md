# How to get files using their modified date and time from Laravel amazon s3 bucket

We are using an amazon s3 bucket for storing files. There are very large number of files present, so we need to read files using date and time filter on which all the files have been created.
We are using Laravel storage library for accessing files.

ini_set('memory_limit', '-1');
$disk = Storage::disk('<disk>');
$files = $disk->files('<folder>');

currently, the process is getting killed due to large amount of files.so we need to filter the files using date and time. Is there any way to read files using date and time?
