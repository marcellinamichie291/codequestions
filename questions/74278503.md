# I am creating a text script in python, and this error occurs:

"<ipython-input-13-4e3095c2a686>" file, line 1
    Text cell <infinite>
            ^
SyntaxError: Invalid syntax

Lines from my script:
Text cell <infinite>
#%%% [markup]

I don't know what to try. I imagine it is something in the language compilation.
