# How to Add Constraint Unique key to Schema that already has duplicate Documents?

I have a Collection in MongoDb which I store Transaction Data inside it. but for some reasons, the data is duplicated inside the collection. for example I have 10 Documents of the same transaction. I decided to create unique key based on 4 keys: Transaction_Date, Transaction_Time, Transaction_Trace and Account_ID. but when I tried to create the constraint, the MongoDb gave me an Error because I have thousands of duplicated transactions inside and I can not remove them one by one. How can I Apply this constraint to the database collection? is there any way to remove the duplicated transactions with one query?
Any Suggestion would be Appreciated.
Update: I can group the transactions with this:
db.transactions.aggregate( [
    {
        $group:
            {
                _id: {
                    Account_ID:"$ACCOUNT_ID",
                    Transaction_Date:"$Transaction_Date",
                    Transaction_Time:"$Transaction_Time",
                    Transaction_Trace:"$Transaction_Trace"
                },count:{$sum:1}
            }
    }
] )

this gave me the count of duplicated transactions.
but I do not know how to keep one transaction and remove the others.
