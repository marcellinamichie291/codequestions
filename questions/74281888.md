# How to send several messages by the same socket?

I want to send several independent messages from a client to a server, depending on a variable that changes. To simulate the scenario I have created a loop to send several numbers, but only the first iteration is working. In the second iteration (which would be, the second message in real) I am getting this error in the client:
OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket

Do you know how to solve it?
I would like to send several values from my client to the server, using the same socket if possible. The client and the server are implemented on my PC for this example.
Server:
import socket

HOST='127.0.0.1'
PORT=6595

#Code for the socket
server=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((HOST,PORT))

server.listen(5)
while True:
    communication_socket,address=server.accept()
    message=communication_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
    print(f"Message from client is: {message}")
    communication_socket.close()

Client:
import socket

HOST='127.0.0.1'
PORT=6595

#Code for the socket
cli=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)

i=1
while i<10:
    cli.connect((HOST,PORT))
    i=str(i)
    cli.send(i.encode('utf-8'))
    #print(cli.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))
    i=int(i)
    i=i+1
    cli.close()
    print(i)

Error I face:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "d:\Python projects\collision.py", line 11, in <module>
    cli.connect((HOST,PORT))
OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket
