# Processing every file from a list of folders

I have a folder structure like
base
|
|---rbbc_23434
|    |------rbbp_34954
|    |        |___this.json
|
|---rbbc_222334
|    |------rbbp_39884954
|    |        |___this.json
|
etc

And I want to process each this.json. Notice that the letters after rbbp are random
I have the following
#! /bin/bash

search_dir=/path/to/base/

bf="$(basename -- $search_dir)"

for entry in "$search_dir"*/
do
    #echo "$entry"
    f="$(basename -- $entry)"
    echo "$f"
    if [[ "$f" == "rbb"* ]]
    then
         echo "$entry"
         ls "$entry""rdgp"*"/this.json"
         #echo "$entry""rdgp"*"/this2.json"

         #python3 something.py --input "$entry""rbbp"*"/this.json" 
         
    fi
done

With ls I can localize the this.json files from all folders but these wildcards do not seem to work when specifying a file for input to a python script or even echo
How can I specify this this.json file as a path to the something.py script?
