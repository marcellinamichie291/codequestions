# Pyinstaller doesn't find hidden import configargparse

I am trying to compile a python program which imports configargparse, but pyinstaller doesn't find it, even if I specify it with hidden imports. I use following command: pyinstaller.exe --onefile  --hidden-import=configargparse some_folder\viewer.py --log-level=DEBUG --debug=imports but when running the exe I get:
# configargparse not found in PYZ
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "some_folder\viewer.py", line 2, in <module>
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 991, in _find_and_load
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 973, in _find_and_load_unlocked
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'configargparse'
[5976] Failed to execute script 'viewer' due to unhandled exception!

Especially weird is that I get this debug message when compiling:
2711 DEBUG: Hidden import 'configargparse' already found
which obviously when running it doesn't seem to be the case
I tried with a small sample program:
import configargparse
print(configargparse.__version__)

but that doesn't work either, same error as for my more complex program.
I could once compile this program, but I'm not sure anymore how and the obvious way doesn't seem to work. What am I missing?
