# How to split a list into multiple batches and assign each batch to a thread worker

I want to split a bigger list (2000 items) into multiple batches, each going to run on a different thread in parallel.
The text of the problem is this:
We need to calculate the sum of squares for a list containing more than 2000 items.
Ex: if the list was [1,2,3,4,5] -> result will be 55
Make sure to implement and time each of the approaches:
15.1. Try using a single threaded approach for calculating the sum of squares for a list of items from 0 to 2000.
15.2. Try using the multithreading approach by splitting the list of items into batches of items that need to be calculated in parallel
This is what I came up with until now:
def divide_list(l, n):

    # looping till length l
    for i in range(0, len(l), n):
        yield l[i : i + n]


def task():
    # didn't know what to write here


if __name__ == "__main__":

    format = "%(asctime)s: %(message)s"
    logging.basicConfig(format=format, level=logging.INFO, datefmt="%H:%M:%S")

    # Single thread

    t1_start = perf_counter()

    squares_single = [x**2 for x in range(2001)]
    print(sum(squares_single))

    t1_stop = perf_counter()

    print("Elapsed time using a single thread in seconds:", t1_stop - t1_start)

    # Multithreading

    t2_start = perf_counter()

    squares_threading = [x**2 for x in range(2001)]
    # print("Square threading: ", squares_threading)
    x = list(divide_list(squares_threading, 200))

    sum = 0
    n_threads = len(x)
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(n_threads) as executor:
        for list in x:
            for result in executor.map(task, list):
                sum += [x**2 for x in list]
        print(sum)
    t2_stop = perf_counter()

    print("Elapsed time using multithreading in seconds:", t2_stop - t2_start)
