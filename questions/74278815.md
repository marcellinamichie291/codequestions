# How to find the max hotspot of a matrix in python

I was given a matrix question on a technical assessment that revolved around the idea of finding the "Max Hotspot".
Areas of connected 1's represent a hotspot, and given a matrix we want to return the max hotspot. Similar to "Number of Islands" or "Word Search.
areamap = [[1, 0, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 1],
           [1, 1, 1, 1]]

areamap = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 0, 0]]


I tried using the 4 way DFS approach but had trouble creating/incrementing a variable that keeps track of the size of each hotspot. Any suggestions/help? Below is my attempt.
The idea of my algo is that every time we find a 1, we "evaporate" it to avoid traveling duplicates. For each 1 we evaporate, we incrementing the count of 1's. The count variable and the tmp list variable always print/return as empty.
class Solution:
    def hotSpots(self, area: List[int]):

        def evap(r, c, cnt):
            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= len(area) or c >= len(area[0]) or area[r][c] == "0":
                return

            cnt += 1
            area[r][c] = "0"
            evap(r, c + 1)
            evap(r, c - 1)
            evap(r + 1, c)
            evap(r - 1, c)
            return

        tmp = []
        for i in range(len(area)):
            for j in range(len(area[0])):
                count = 0
                if area[i][j] == "1":
                    evap(i, j, count)
                    tmp.append(count)
        return sum(max(tmp))
