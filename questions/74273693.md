# Makefile: how to avoid specifying all targets manually

I wrote this Makefile:
all: clean basedemo.exe

clean:
  rm -f *.exe

%.exe: %.s
  vasmm68k_mot -kick1hunks -Fhunkexe -o $@ -nosym $<

My goal would be to compile every .s file in the current folder to a separate .exe.
Right now, I have to append the new .exe file name to the line: all: clean basedemo.exe new_file.exe
Is there a way to avoid having to do that?
Thank you
I tried using a wildcard:
all: clean $(wildcard *.exe)
But when I run make all only the clean recipe runs.
