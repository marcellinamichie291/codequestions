# How to add rows in R already grouped?

I have this dataset
 dat=structure(list(A = c("n", 
                                                                     
  "n", "F", "F"), Par = c(1, 
                                                                                                                
   1, 8, 3), var = c(1, 10, 1,5), dat = c("T", 
                                                                                                                                                       
   "T", "T", "T")), row.names = c(NA, 4L                                                                                                                                                    
    ), class = "data.frame")

I want to add by the groups in A   , i  tried this did not work:
  dat%>%group_by(A)%>% mutate(ye = c( "40-25", "25-200"))

Desired output:
    A Par var dat     ye

  3 F   8   1   T  "40-25"
  4 F   3   5   T  "25-200"
