# To copy files from 1 source folder to 2 destonation folders based on a criteria

I am working on this code which successfully can copy the files from one folder to another folder perfectly using (moveFilesFromListPartial) by reading the names from Excel sheet. However, I need a help in it.
Is it possible if the files should be copied from 1 source folder to two destination folders based on the a criteria defined below.
e.g. 1 have 1 source folder and 2 Destination folders (Destination_1) and (Destination_2). Whatever the names mentioned in Sheet1 cells A1 to A20 should be moved to Destination_2 folder and all remaining files should be moved to Destination_1 folder.

I shall remain thankful
the code i have is mentioned below
Sub moveFilesFromListPartial_A()
    
    Const sPath As String = "E:\Sourece"
    Const dPath As String = "E:\Destination"
    Const fRow As Long = 2
    Const Col As String = "A"
    
    ' Reference the worksheet.
    Dim ws As Worksheet: Set ws = Sheet1
    
    ' Calculate the last row,
    ' i.e. the row containing the last non-empty cell in the column.
    Dim lRow As Long: lRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, Col).End(xlUp).Row
                
    ' Validate the last row.
    If lRow < fRow Then
        MsgBox "No data in column range.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Early Binding - needs a reference
    ' to 'Tools > References > Microsoft Scripting Runtime' (has intelli-sense)
    Dim fso As Scripting.FileSystemObject
    Set fso = New Scripting.FileSystemObject
    ' Late Binding - needs no reference (no intelli-sense)
    'Dim fso As Object: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    ' Validate the source folder path.
    Dim sFolderPath As String: sFolderPath = sPath
    If Right(sFolderPath, 1) <> "\" Then sFolderPath = sFolderPath & "\"
    If Not fso.FolderExists(sFolderPath) Then
        MsgBox "The source folder path '" & sFolderPath _
            & "' doesn't exist.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Validate the destination folder path.
    Dim dFolderPath As String: dFolderPath = dPath
    If Right(dFolderPath, 1) <> "\" Then dFolderPath = dFolderPath & "\"
    If Not fso.FolderExists(dFolderPath) Then
        MsgBox "The destination folder path '" & dFolderPath _
            & "' doesn't exist.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    Dim r As Long ' current row in worksheet column

    Dim sFileName As String

For r = fRow To lRow
    sPartialFileName = CStr(ws.Cells(r, Col).Value)
    If Len(sPartialFileName) > 3 Then ' the cell is not blank
        ' 'Begins with' sPartialFileName
        sFileName = Dir(sFolderPath & sPartialFileName & "*")
        ' or instead, 'Contains' sPartialFileName
        'sFileName = Dir(sFolderPath & "*" & sPartialFileName & "*")
        Do While sFileName <> ""
            If Len(sFileName) > 3 Then ' source file found
                sFilePath = sFolderPath & sFileName
                dFilePath = dFolderPath & sFileName
                If Not fso.FileExists(dFilePath) Then ' the source file...
                    fso.CopyFile sFilePath, dFilePath ' ... doesn't exist...
                    sYesCount = sYesCount + 1 ' ... in the destination
                Else ' the source file exists in the destination folder
                    dYesCount = dYesCount + 1
                End If
            Else ' the source file doesn't exist
                sNoCount = sNoCount + 1
            End If
            sFileName = Dir
        Loop
    Else ' the cell is blank
        BlanksCount = BlanksCount + 1
    End If
Next r

End Sub
