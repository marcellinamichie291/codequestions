# How to configure alerts for line chart and card visual pinned on dashboard?

I understand that alerts can only be configured on visuals that are pinned to Power BI dashboard.
I have pinned line chart and a card. But can't see any option to configure the alert. Are alerts only supported for specific visuals (and which?)?
