# How to filter different values from a specific column?

I have a code:
SELECT *
from (select rank() over(partition by color_id order by rand(101)) as rank_nr,* 
FROM table1

WHERE action_code_is in(SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE action_code_is = 'pink' LIMIT 4)
UNION ALL
(SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE action_code_is = 'yellow' LIMIT 5)
UNION ALL
(SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE action_code_is = 'blue' LIMIT 6)
UNION ALL
(SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE action_code_is = 'green'LIMIT 3)

order by color_id)a 
WHERE rank_nr<=18

The main thing that I have thousands of data (action_code_is) and every color_id has all these action_code_is. I need to filter only 18 results of each color_id(also have many data) in which would be included only pink, yellow, blue, green values and only with set quantity.
I know that code does not look well, and I know that there are mistakes, because it does not work for me. But I am very fresh here and cannot find solution. Could someone help me?
