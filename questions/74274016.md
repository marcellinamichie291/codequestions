# Unable to add Additional kind clusters in Argo CD

I am having two kind clusters in my local machine . One is named as dev-cluster and another one as kind.The Argo CD is deployed and running on dev-cluster.When i try to Add the second cluster to Argo CD using argocd cluster add kind-kind --name stage command i am getting the following error

The output of `kubectl config get-contexts is

I have tried to do a port forward to the port 45249  using kubectl port-forward kube-apiserver-kind-control-plane -n kube-system --context kind-kind 45249:45249  and tried to add the cluster in Argo Cd
Also i have tried to add the second cluster using its node ip to Argo CD
kubectl get nodes -o wide --context kind-kind
