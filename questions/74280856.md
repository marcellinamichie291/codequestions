# Why my storage variable doesn't load when my functional component mounts?

I want to save my store(array of todos) in localStorage when my functional component unmounts. And when my component mounts (for example when App refreshes), it should read that variable from localStorage.
But why when I refresh the app, previous data doesn't load?
This is a part of my code:
function App() {

    const storeContents = useSelector(state => state.todo);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    useEffect(() => {
        const todos = localStorage.getItem("dd");
        if(todos){
            dispatch({type: "todos/loadTodos", payload: JSON.parse(todos)})
        }
        return () => {
            localStorage.setItem("dd", JSON.stringify(storeContents));
        }
        // eslint-disable-next-line
    },[])
.
.

My slice:
const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name: "todos",
    initialState: [],
    reducers: {
        loadTodos(state, action){
            return action.payload;
        },
.
.

I checked this question and used JSON.stringify and JSON.parse but it doesn't work again: React Redux Toolkit: How can I can store my initialState to localStorage using createSlice?
