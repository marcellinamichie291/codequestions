# Mixing different source character sets / char representations in c++

I am writing a plugin using the (very dated) Photoshop SDK. Given that there is no documented way of using native Photoshop Widgets as Dialogues to change settings, I decided to use Qt as a fallback GUI. That's when I ran into a problem:
Qt seems to enforce its UTF-8 character set on all files in my project, as soon as I link Qt::Widgets to my CMake target. This results in warnings like The file contains a character starting at offset 0x35f4 that is illegal in the current source character set (codepage 65001). and errors like error C2664: 'errno_t strcpy_s(char *,rsize_t, const char *)': cannot convert argument 1 from 'char *' to 'char *' (Types pointed to are unrelated). The former could be solved by converting all files to UTF-8, but the latter seems to have to do with different char size representations inside the program.
My own code does not produce those problems, the problem is inside the SDK's CPP files that I compile with my target. Is there a way to tell the compiler, that those files should be treated differently?
