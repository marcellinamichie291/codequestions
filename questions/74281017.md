# Can't get my for loop to work - Historical return data gathered in one DataFrame

I want to gather all the return data from the stocks included in the S&P500 from the last two years in Python. I use the following code to try to get the data for each stock, but I'm having trouble looping through all the tickers/symbols. I have succeeded in getting from individual stocks by not looping and simply stating the desired symbol.
My code so far:
import pyEX as p
stock_list = stocks['Ticker'].tolist()
c = p.Client(api_token='TOKEN', version='stable')
complete_historical_data = []
for x in stock_list:
    sym = x
    timeframe = '2y'
    df = c.chartDF(symbol=sym, timeframe=timeframe)[['close']]
    complete_historical_data.append(df)
complete_historical_data = pd.concat(complete_historical_data)

Imported is a package from IEX Cloud to access the data. 2y is the how far back I need the data.
How do I go from this code - which returns an error - to a one Dataframe with all the stocks, the dates and the daily returns?
Thank you.
