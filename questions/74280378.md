# How to create identity in mail server

I am creating simple mail server with CentOS 7.  1 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 50 GB Storage.
I installed :
1. Apache
2. MySQL
3. dovecot - IMAP/POP
4. postfix - SMTP
5. Roundcube - Email Client

But now the problem is how to create a user like admin@example.com, support@example.com, etc. with passwords and also an alias mails.
Because my server config is low i do not want to install iRedMail, modoboa, mailcow, etc. These application install lot of unwanted and heavy load on my server and even crash it.
Is there any open source mailbox for this operation or any small coding which can help me do this?
