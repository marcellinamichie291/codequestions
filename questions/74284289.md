# It says invalid datatype

This is my SQL script; when I try to run, I get an error:

ORA-00902: invalid datatype

SQL:
CREATE TABLE TranInfo 
(
    T_ID CHAR(11) NOT NULL, 
    T_Amount NUMBER(15) NOT NULL,
    T_Time Time, 
    T_Date Date, 
    C_ID CHAR(11) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(T_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY(C_ID)REFERENCES Customer (C_ID)
);
        

What is wrong? Please help me - I can't find it.
