# Create calculated field with condition from another column

I have data that shows student name and the years they attended the school along with the grades they achieved each year.
I need to visualize this in a horizontal bar graph with names on the y-axis and grades on the x-axis
My dataset looks somewhat like this:




name
Year
Grade




John
2016
79



2017
65


Smith
2018
87



2019
56


Mary
2017
92


Jack
2016
95



2017
75




I want a dropdown/parameter based on the year that changes my data in a way that shows, The names and grades of the selected year only.
So if I were to select 2017, I want the data to look like this:




Name
Grade




John
65


Mary
92


Jack
75




I've tried something like this with no luck in the 'create calculated field' dialog box:

If [Parameters].[By Year] == "2017"
THEN
[Name] = WHEN [year] = "2017"
END
