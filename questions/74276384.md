I need to change the foeeach in JavaScript but I don't know how to do anyone can write it or encode
var isExist = false;
var cashoutIndex = 0;
CashOutData.forEach((item, index) => {
  if (item.id === userBets[0][i].id) {
    isExist = true;
    cashoutIndex = index;
  }
});

Change of for each loop and faster the performance
