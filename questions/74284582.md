# Epoch Value: How to set the time 12AM next day?

Let's say I have an epoch value 1665531785000 which converts to "Tuesday, October 11, 2022 11:43:05 PM" in human readable format.
How can we modify 1665531785000 to 1665532800000 which converts to "Wednesday, October 12, 2022 12:00:00 AM"(set the value to 12AM next day) in javascript/typescript
