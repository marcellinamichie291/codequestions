# How can I FIND the last instance of a character in a string? (Google Sheets)

I need a Google Sheet function that will return the position of the last instance of a particular character. Basically, FIND, but starting on the right.
For example, for the data set below, I need to return the position of the last dash.
ABC-DEF-GHI = 8
ABCD-EF-GH-IJK = 11
AB-C-DE-FGH-I-JK = 14

Thanks!
I don't know where to start. MID might work, but the file names are of different lengths and different formats. The files just generally end with - ***.png, and I need the asterisk. The string I need is also of variable length and can contain spaces (the string is the name of the student).
