# How to navigate thorugh a matrix without knowing its size

Let's say I have a main class in java that receives a matrix[][], like: `
public main[] findBall(int[][] grid) {
        
    }

`
And then the user enters the imput:
[[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]

I know it's a 5x5 but only because I saw what the user typed, how do I get the matrix size->(5x5) or any other size that they may type? or is there another way to navigate through it without knowing the size?
I tried nothing, I'm a beginner in Java so bear with me.
