# IntelliJ - How to set syntax highlighting in *.txt files?

I have a txt file where part of it is json. I'd like to turn on syntax highlighting just for the part that is json. I read answers on similar questions and they said to press alt + enter to bring up a menu that will allow me to set this. But when I press alt + enter nothing happens in a .txt file.
