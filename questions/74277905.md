# Find queryset where one field is greater than another one

I have model Shop, I want to get all shops which time_open(opening time) is more than time_closed(closing time). For example 23:00:00 is more than 07:00:00 (Shop_2(Night shift shop)).
class Shop(models.Model):
    time_open = models.TimeField()
    time_closed = models.TimeField()

for example i have two objects:
shop_1 = {
    "time_open": "08:00:00",
    "time_closed": "22:00:00"
}

shop_2 = {
    "time_open": "23:00:00",
    "time_closed": "07:00:00"
}

My goal is to output queryset in which shop_2 would be.
These timestamps in these objects only for visual example, i want to do it without putting any data in sql query. I want to achive this by comparing time_open and time_closed fields.
I found similar question in pure SQL:
Find rows where one field is greater than another one
My goal is to do it with Django ORM.
