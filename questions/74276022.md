# How to access variables outside for and if conditio

I need a small help with the below code.
I have two sites called - Mumbai, Hyderabad
sdc = "mum"
ddc= "hyd
I need to fetch the egress and ingress acl file  when sdc == mum  it should get only mum3-cell-egress.jcl file
and
when ddc = hyd , it should give get only hyd3-cell-ingress.jcl file
JUNOS_POP_NAME = {"mum": "mum3", "hyd": "hyd3" }
king = [sdc, ddc]
for name in king:
    dc =  POP_NAME[name].strip()  #mum3 #hyd3
    print(dc)
    rpm_name = os.path.join("policy-acls-junos-"+dc)
    aclname_s = []
    aclname_d = []
    if name == sdc:
       aclname_s = os.path.join(dc + "-cell-egress.jcl")
    if name == ddc:
       aclname_d = os.path.join(dc + "-cell-ingress.jcl")
    print(aclname_s)
    print(aclname_d)

but the output I am getting below empty list because I am using for loop , I want to get only mum3-cell-egress.jcl and hyd3-cell-ingress.jcl.
I want to access variable outside if function to use them to another logic.
current Output
mum3-cell-egress.jcl
[] []
[][]
hyd3-cell-ingress.jcl
Required output:
mum3-cell-egress.jcl
hyd3-cell-ingress.jcl
I am looking for suggestions
