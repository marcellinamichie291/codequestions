# Quickly filtering geopositions in or out of a multipolygon with C#

I am using NetTopologySuite with C# to filter points inside the precise boundaries of a country with a pretty simple way:
var path = "fr.shp"; // "big" country and boundaries need to be precise in my case

var reader = new ShapeDataReader(path);
var mbr = reader.ShapefileBounds;
var result = reader.ReadByMBRFilter(mbr);

var polygons = new List<Geometry>();

using (var coll = result.GetEnumerator())
{
    while (coll.MoveNext())
    {
        var item = coll.Current;

        if (item == null)
        {
            continue;
        }

        polygons.Add(item.Geometry);
    }
}

var polygon = new GeometryCombiner(polygons).Combine();

var points = new List<Point>();
List<Point> pointsToFilterWithBorders; // loaded from DB, not visible here but we have 1,350,000 points to filter

Parallel.ForEach(pointsToFilterWithBorders, point =>
{
    if (polygon.Contains(point))
        points.Add(point);
});

It's working fine (filtering works great!) but it's pretty slow... like one day to do the filtering for only 1,350,000 points!
Any idea on how to improve that?
I tried to use Parallel.ForEach but still very long and I tried to find something like a "batch" compare in NetTopologySuite but couldn't find a quicker solution to filter my points in this big shapefile...
