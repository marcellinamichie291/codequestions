# AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'insert' Python

I'm working on a mini project, it's a hangman game in python. I'm currently able to pick a randomwork from a list, ask user to guess and replace blanks with words.
However, i am facing two challenges

When blanks are replaced with correct letters, and the code runs again, the already placed alphabets are replaced with blanks are removed and the process begins again.
I tried using the insert method, but i kept getting "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'insert'"

import random

#Create a list holding the words
word_list = ["ardvak","donkey", "baboon", "elephant", "Tiger"]

#randomly chose a word from word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word
def randomWord():
    for word in word_list:
        global chosen_word 
        chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
    print(f"random word :" +chosen_word)
randomWord()

#ask the user to guess a letter and assign that to a variable called guess. convert to lower case
def askUser():
    global guess 
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
askUser()

#Check if guess is in chosen_word

# lenght of choosen word
def len_chosen_word1():
    global len_chosen_word
    len_chosen_word = len(chosen_word)
    
def guessWord():
    len_chosen_word1()
    guesses = 0
    alpha_count = 0
    global blanks
    blanks = []
    if guesses  < len_chosen_word:
        for alpha in chosen_word:
            alpha = alpha
            alpha_count+=1
            alpha_count-=1
            if guess in alpha:
               blanks = blanks.insert(alpha_count, guess) 
            else:
                blanks = blanks.insert(alpha_count,'_')
            guesses+=1
    print(blanks)
guessWord()

#search for occurence of blanks

while '_' in blanks:
    askUser();
    guessWord();

I tried using the insert method on the blank list and assigning it to a veriable to stop alphabets from disappearing
def guessWord():
    len_chosen_word1()
    guesses = 0
    alpha_count = 0
    global blanks
    blanks = []
    if guesses  < len_chosen_word:
        for alpha in chosen_word:
            alpha = alpha
            alpha_count+=1
            alpha_count-=1
            if guess in alpha:
               blanks = blanks.insert(alpha_count, guess) 
            else:
                blanks = blanks.insert(alpha_count,'_')
            guesses+=1
    print(blanks)
