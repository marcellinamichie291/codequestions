# Runtime Error 1004, but not following the IF THEN ELSE instruction?

Morning All,
Probably something basic I'm doing but i get a 1004 "No cells were found" error in my macro now. This worked fine before so not sure if a recent upgrade has caused an issue or something (I'm on 2019 version)?
Anyway, basically I need to filter a list where column R = "Yes" and delete the contents if it is "Yes". Otherwise, just move on.
Code snippet below..
    Sheets("Send").Select

    ActiveSheet.Range("$A$1:$R$375").AutoFilter Field:=18, Criteria1:="Yes"
    Range("O2:O376").Select
    
   'If Application.Sum(Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)) = 0 Then
    If Application.Sum(Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)) > 0 Then
    'On Error Resume Next
    Range("a2:n376").Select
    Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Select
    Selection.ClearContents
    Else
    
    End If

Thanks all.
