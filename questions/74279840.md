I have to write a function in Python that sorts numbers in either ascending or descending value. I have the general idea of what to do but don't know how to start. Is there a type of sort I should be trying to use? Is there some type of basic flat sort, sans all the specific types? I think my biggest issue is the little filler stuff. I know how to make a function and how I specifically need to do it. But the smaller stuff one normally forgets about is what keeps messing me up.
