# Cannot Find libatomic.so.l, but a version is installed

I'm trying to build snappy, but I end up getting the error
 error while loading shared libraries: libatomic.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

When I go look in /lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/8/ I do find a file libatomic.so
Which has the contents
INPUT ( /usr/lib64/libatomic.so.1.2.0 )

then if I go looking in /usr/lb64/ only these files exist
libatomic_ops_gpl.so.1
libatomic_ops_gpl.so.1.1.2
libatomic_ops.so.1
libatomic_ops.so.1.1.1  

I try doing yum install libatomic_ops.x86_64, it says nothing to do. That is the only package that comes up when doing yum search libatomic.
I'm confused with how to solve this issue. Thanks!
For what it matters, this is a redhat 8.6 machine.
