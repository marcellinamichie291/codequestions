# Laravel 7: How to match two tables column?

Please see my code first,
Measurement Table:




id
customer_id
service_id




1
1
2


2
1
3


2
2





Controller:
$customer = Customer::findOrFail($id);
$ex = Measurement::where('customer_id', $id)->pluck('service_id');
    if(count($ex) == 0){
      $service = Service::where('status', 0)->get();
    }
    else{
      $service = Service::where('id', '!=', $ex)->where('status', 0)->get();
    }

In Measurement table, if a customer doesn't have any service_id  then $service = Service::where('status', 0)->get(); this will pass in view file.
If a customer have a service_id, then in view file all services will pass except that service_id.
Can anyone suggest me a better way for this?
