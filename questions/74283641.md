# MongoDB $push until max array size

Overview
We have a Mongo database collecting time series data from multiple different stream channels. This data is stored using a paging pattern where each page document holds a subset of the overall timeline (currently 3600 points per page).
For example, we may have 10,000 data points divided into 3 pages with capacities: 3600, 3600, 2800 respectfully.
Below is our current update operation, it pushes a new point to the points array within a collection containing less than 3600 datapoints (defined by count).
db.stream_pages.updateOne(
    {
        "stream_id": ObjectId("635046f885b5ab956ba279a6"),
        "group_id": ObjectId("6277597d7558ec17694ae0f8"),
        "count": {
            "$lt": 3600
        }
    },
    {
        "$push": {
            "points": 100
        },
        "$inc": {
            "count": 1
        },
        "$set": {
            "end": Date()
        },
        "$setOnInsert": {
            "stream_id": ObjectId("635046f885b5ab956ba279a6"),
            "begin": Date(),
            "group_id": ObjectId("6277597d7558ec17694ae0f8")
        }
    },
    upsert: true
)


Problem Statement
We are starting to get a higher influx of data causing a significant amount of $push operations on updates. Currently, each incoming datapoint requires a $push into the latest page document. The latest document is defined as the only document containing less than 3600 points (custom indexes are used to optimize this lookup).
We would prefer to push N items into existing pages similarly like so:
db.stream_pages.updateOne(
    {
        "stream_id": stream_id,
        "group_id": group_id,
        "count": {
            "$lt": 3600
        }
    },
    {
        "$push": {
            "points": {
                "$each": [ 100, 100, 101, 20 ],
            }
        },
        "$inc": {
            "count": N # current length of array passed
        },
        "$set": {
            "end": Date()
        },
        "$setOnInsert": {
            "stream_id": stream_id,
            "begin": Date(),
            "group_id": group_id
        },
    },
    upsert: true
)

While this operation works, it does not respect the cap of 3600 datapoints we put on each page, causing pages to grow in excess of 3600 points. The ideal update operation would handle two cases: point capacity is respected and overflow points are upserted into a new document.
Does Mongo have a method to find and then use the queried document as input conditionals for the update? Worst case we do a query before this insertion and only push a calculated amount of points to the array, this is not atomic however which can cause issues down the line.
