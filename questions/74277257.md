# Access .env variables in .mdx file | Remix

What is the best way to access environment variables in a .mdx file.
Remix's approach to accessing .env variables in a normal component is to use the loader data hook (useLoaderData()). However, hooks cannot be used so easily in .mdx files.
I also tried passing the environment variables via props from the parent component, but that didn't work either, as I couldn't figure out which library Remix uses to work with .mdx files.
cheers
