# SQL Server table data deletion while insertion is in progress in another session

I have a table (TableA).
There is a probability that more than one process may try to delete data from TableA and at the same time more than one process may try to insert data into same table i.e. TableA.
Will this result in table lock? If yes, how can I avoid locking the table and making sure that read, insert and delete can happen in parallel.
