# Make specific text to bold in json string, react-i18next

{
"string": "This is a bold string"
}
I want to get the bold text to display it into the UI, and the string is coming from JSON file. Also, this string will be translated into another languages.
Like: - i18next.t('string')
I tried using  and also passing tried changing the text nature, while passing it into i18next.t.
