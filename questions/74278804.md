# Set same python executable path for Spyder and anaconda prompt

I am using Anaconda in Windows. When I open spyder in an environment, the sys.executable path is set to the default for that environment C:\Users\{username}\.conda\envs\{envname}\python.exe. ("{}" here simply are placeholders). But, the path shown when I use sys.executable command for the same environment in anaconda prompt is different. It shows C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\python3.exe. Naturally, this other environment does not have the packages I need. How can we set the anaconda prompt path to be the same as the path being used from spyder ?
Anaconda 3 is being used, and yes, I recently also installed MinGW for C++, but I do not understand why its python is being used over the environment default.
I have also added Anaconda3 and Anaconda3\Scripts to PATH.
