# (hostinger laravel project) What should i put inside the subdomains folder to convert a domain into subdomain?

I have a hosting sites with a laravel project where its lowest accessible directory is public_html and eurotracks(the content folder). Currently the .htaccess and index.php is at public_html while all the contents and views is at eurotracks. I want to move the domain into a subdomain because another website needs to be set up.
When i created the subdomain named euro in my hostinger hosting sites, a euro folder appears in public_html. I tried inserting the public_html content into the euro file to migrate the website(including .htaccess and index.php) but it doesnt work, inserting the contents file doesnt work too. How should I migrate a laravel project from domain into subdomain using hostinger?
