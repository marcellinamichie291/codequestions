# Python pandas read_sql special character in column name

I am getting a special character error for the table name that has the &&, for the & symbol. SQLplus runs the query escaping the & with &&, so I used the same syntax.
I've tried backticks which also give invalid character error, could someone provide some insight on how to pass this column name with & in the name?
conn = pyodbc.connect("DRIVER={AspenTech SQLplus};HOST=HOSTNAME;PORT=000000")
sql= "select NAME, RECORD&&FLD from Table"
data = pd.read_sql(sql,conn)
"[HY000] Invalid character: '&' (0) (SQLExecDirectW)"

I tried back ticks, did not work.
