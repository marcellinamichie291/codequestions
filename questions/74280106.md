# How do I calculate a rolling average over a specific timeframe in BigQuery?

I have a BigQuery table like the one below, where data wasn't necessarily recorded at a consistent rate:
| timestamp               | value |
|-------------------------|-------|
| 2022-10-01 00:03:00 UTC | 2.43  |
| 2022-10-01 00:17:00 UTC | 4.56  |
| 2022-10-01 00:36:00 UTC | 3.64  |
| 2022-10-01 00:58:00 UTC | 2.15  |
| 2022-10-01 01:04:00 UTC | 2.90  |
| 2022-10-01 01:13:00 UTC | 5.88  |
  ...                       ...

I want to calculate a rolling average (as a new column) on value over a certain timeframe, e.g. the previous 12 hours. I know it's relatively simple to do over a fixed number of rows, and I've tried using LAG and TIMESTAMP_SUB functions to select the right values to average over, but I'm quite new to SQL so I'm not even sure if this is the right approach.
Does anyone know how to go about this? Thanks!
