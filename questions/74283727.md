# Substitute for the geometry property when working with a GLTF/GLB model in ThreeJS?

I have the following code in my ThreeJS scene that I use for computing the center of a 3D object, by getting its bounding box first:
    const geometry = threeJsMesh.geometry;
    geometry.computeBoundingBox();

This has worked fine for me with the cubes, planes, spheres, etc. I have created for my ThreeJS world.  But I am now working with 3D models and when I tried to execute that code on a GLTF/GLB model I have in the world, I discovered that its geometry property was undefined.
So I take it that 3D models don't have a geometry property?  If so, how can I computer the bounding box of a 3D model and also its center point?
