# NextJS application failing to build on windows. Call retries were exceeded

We have a problem in our NextJS application.
The other team members are using linux and do not have any issues.
However when I (on windows 10) try to pull repository and yarn && yarn build. This happens:
Type error: Cannot find type definition file for 'fs-capacitor'.
  The file is in the program because:
    Entry point for implicit type library 'fs-capacitor'


> Build error occurred
Error: Call retries were exceeded
at ChildProcessWorker.initialize ... \node_modules\next\dist\compiled\jest-worker\index.js:1:11661
 type: 'WorkerError'

We are using node 16.15.1. and .nvmrc lts/gallium
I have tried rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf yarn.lock && yarn install.
I have tried to remove some of the never packages the team has added but to no awail.
