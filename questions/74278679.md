# DeFi Wallet browser cannot call to my API

I have two website that call tho same API, it use DeFi Wallet app ( wallet of crypto.com) to connect wallet. On desktop, chrome app mobile and Metamask brower, everything work ok, but on DeFi Wallet browser in android device, user report that they only see UI, and cannot load data, this happens because on DeFi Wallet browser, something wrong with my API, but nothing showed on my server logs. And this error happens even if user don't use some wallet feature like connect, create transaction.
This error just happend few day ago.
