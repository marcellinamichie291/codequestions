# Update context from inside provider

What is the best way of updating a context value from inside the provider?
In the example I have a context called recipe which has a totalCost and an array of ProductLine[]
const RecipeContextProvider = ({
  children,
  value = {} as RecipeContent,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  value?: RecipeContent;
}) => {
  const [recipe, setRecipe] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Test")
    const {grains} = recipe;
    let cost = 0;
    if(grains !== undefined){
      grains.map((ingredient) => {
        cost += ingredient.lineTotal;
      })
    }
    setRecipe({...recipe, totalCost: cost})
    
  }, [recipe.grains])
  
  return (
    <RecipeContext.Provider
      value={{ recipe, setRecipe }}
    >
      {children}
    </RecipeContext.Provider>
  );
};

Each time the array is updated I want to update the total cost without needing to do this from inside the child component. The useEffect does not seem to hit.
