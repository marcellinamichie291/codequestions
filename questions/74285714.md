# How to fix CROSS Error in AWS S3 ( React JS )

I need your help!
Now I working in one project for my company!
here I face one issue ( cross error from aws s3 )
below you can see the images.

This application connects an image in AWS s3 to a user image using html-to-image npm.
This causes the common aws s3 cross error that occurs.
Do you have a solution for this?
