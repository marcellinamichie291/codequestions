# Handling class imbalance where difference between class is not apparent


I am working on a classication model, where there is a 93%:7% class imbalance. I've used SMOTE to create a balanced dataset, but the model performance does not change. Visually (see sample plots), it looks to me that the two classes are identical in their appearance and so k-nn in SMOTE is not helpful.
I'd be grateful for any paper/solutions/approaches to this class imbalance problem.
