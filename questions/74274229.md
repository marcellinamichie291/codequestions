# Downloading PDFs without the link or .pdf extension specified in the href tag

I want to download PDFs from a website https://www.mca.gov.in/content/mca/global/en/data-and-reports/reports/monthly-information-bulletin.html which does not show the link or .pdf extension in the href tag clearly. I have loacted the tag which has the link but i am unalbe to figure out the code
for link in soup.select("a[href$='.pdf']"):
    
    #try printing all pdf urls from the page
    print (link)

How can I download these PDFs by changing these codes? Please suggest different codes if any. Thank you
I tried using the # which is mentioned in the href tag in this code
for link in soup.select("a[href$='.pdf']"):
    
    #try printing all pdf urls from the page
    print (link)

But the PDFs were not downloaded
