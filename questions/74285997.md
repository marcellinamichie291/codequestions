# Unable to retrieve Analytics data for branded accounts using YouTube Analytics API

I am trying to get analytics data for a brand account that I am the administrator of.
I am going to use Google Apps Script and YouTube Analytics API to retrieve the data.
I am trying to get the sample code in the link below to work.
https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/youtube-analytics
Lines 7 through 10 of this sample code have been commented out.
(The relevant part is below)
const channels = YouTube.Channels.list('id,contentDetails', {
    mine: true
  });
const channelId = channels.items[0].id;

Instead, the description assigns the ID of the brand account to the variable channelId. (below)
const channelId = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' // My brand account channel ID

I tried to run the script in this state, but got the following error.
GoogleJsonResponseException: API call to youtubeAnalytics.reports.query failed with error: Forbidden
createReport    @ youtube_analytics_api.gs:25

What can I do to resolve this error and get the API to run successfully?
