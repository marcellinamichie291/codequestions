# FULL OUTER JOIN Not Working As Expected ON Two Equalities

I combine the two tables below in Big Query using a full outer join. Table A does not have certain products that I need to bring over from table B, but when I join on campaign & subcampaign, my join is not bringing over the 'Cell Phone' data. I join
ON a.campaign = b.campaign
AND a.subcampaign = b.subcampaign

Table a




Campaign
Subcampaign
Product
Sales




Campaign 1
Store 581
Gaming
$50


Campaign 1
Store 583
TV
$100




Table b




Campaign
Subcampaign
Product
Cost




Campaign 1
Store 581
Gaming
$25


Campaign 1
Store 583
TV
$75


Campaign 1
Store 584
Cellphone
$10




Result: A left join (no cellphone data).
Desired result:




Campaign
Subcampaign
Product
Sales
Cost




Campaign 1
Store 581
Gaming
$50
$25


Campaign 1
Store 583
TV
$100
$75


Campaign 1
Store 584
Cellphone
NULL
$10
