# How to dynamically change/set arrow size of an edge in sigma v2?

I am trying to let the user control the arrow size without affecting the size of the edge, in v1 (canvas renderer), it was done like with changing the minArrowSize in the settings, this is not the case in v2 (WebGL).
I have seen this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73988100/9294601 that allows me to statically modify the size of the input, but how can I access this thickness variable dyanmically
I tried this but as expected, it did not work (note: I am using sim51/react-sigma
<SigmaContainer
                        settings={{
                            nodeProgramClasses: {image: getNodeProgramImage(), circle: CircleNodeProgram},
                            edgeProgramClasses: {
                                arrow: ArrowEdgeProgram,
                            },
                            minArrowSize: 100,
                            ...graphSettings,
                        }}
                        style={{height: '100%', background: props.noBackground ? 'white' : mainBackgroundColor}}
                    >
