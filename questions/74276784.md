# How does the `gcloud` CLI use OAuth2 to authenticate a user?

I'm trying to mimic the flow for authenticating with GCP using the gcloud CLI in a Go project. In this case, I can't just shell out to gcloud using the os package because I have to assume it's not installed on the system. I also need to avoid having the user go in and set an OAuth2 client_id and client_secret in the developer console since the gcloud CLI doesn't seem to require it.
I was trying to look through the Python code for gcloud and I can sort of see what it's doing but it's a bit difficult to follow since I'm not super experienced in Python and it seems like there are many layers of abstraction in the authentication code that are a bit hard to break through.
I can see the GCP URLs (the ones that you open in the browser when doing gcloud auth login) have a client_id but they don't have a client_secret. They also look like they do PKCE but I'm not super familiar with how that works. I also can't figure out exactly where they get the client_id from. If it's somehow bundled with the gcloud CLI I can't find it anywhere.
