# Dynamically MVC form

I have a dynamic ASP.NET MVC form with different controls like textbox and radio list. I am trying to understand how to get the values from the form.
Using formCollection I can get the value that was enter but I don't know what type of control. I will not know how many controls are loaded on the form because it will be built at runtime.
I have two database tables one with will store the text value from a textbox and another one from the radio list. Is there a way I can find more information from the formCollection or is there a better way to do this?
[HttpPost]
[StandaloneResponseFilter]
public PartialViewResult CreatePollingResponse(FormCollection formCollection)
{
    List<PollingResponseFormViewModel> ListofPollingResponse = new List<PollingResponseFormViewModel>();

    foreach (var key in formCollection.AllKeys)
    {
        PollingResponseFormViewModel model = new PollingResponseFormViewModel();
        model.MeetingPollingPartsValuesId = key;
        model.MeetingPollingQuestionResponse = formCollection[key];

        ListofPollingResponse.Add(model);
    }

    return PartialView();
}
