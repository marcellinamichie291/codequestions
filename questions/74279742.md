I'm new to deep learning and I have a doubt related to the correlation among the input variables of FFN. More precisely, do high correlated regressors affect the training of the net? In that case, in which way?
I made some researches and I understand that normally an high correlation is not good because it means that more regressors are supplying almost the same information. So, in case of sequential data it increases up to an high value but I expect that this one coincides with an information which could lead to a better prediction. I'm a bit confused about these two aspects.
