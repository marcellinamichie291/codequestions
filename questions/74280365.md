# Calculate the total from 2 tables - Powerbi

So, I have two tables I need to combine without merging as I was told merging the tables does not auto update when posted so had to separate my tables. So, I have Fioptics and legacy tables where I pull RecordID, JobTypeID and CustTypeID individually below is how my code looks
legacy res install = CALCULATE(COUNT
(LEGACY[RecordID]),FILTER(LEGACY,LEGACY[JobTypeID]=1 
&& LEGACY[CustTypeID] = 1 && LEGACY[prod_grouping]="legacy"))

and
fioptics res install = CALCULATE(COUNT
(FIOPTIC[RecordID]),FILTER(FIOPTIC,FIOPTIC[JobTypeID]=1 
&& FIOPTIC[CustTypeID] = 1 && FIOPTIC[prod_grouping]="fioptics"))

how do I go about using a dax function to pull from both RecordID's, JobTypeID and CustTypeID and filter from my FIOPTICS AND LEGACY tables at the same time? It might be a simple answer but having a brain fart maybe overlooking a simple solution to this problem.
