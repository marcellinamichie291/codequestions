# How can i run an R markdown script automatically at set intervals on the cloud?

I have an R script, that calls and runs several R markdown scripts which need to be run every day, preferably every hour. The belonging data files are continuously retrieved by MS Power Automate. Everything left for it to be fully automated is if the script could run by itself every day, or better, every hour. Preferably this would not require a physical pc to be on either. The RMD- and belonging data files are currently in a Sharepoint folder. Preferably the solution is cheap or free as well. Any suggestions?
Thanks.
