# Modify profile on Azure AD B2C connected Angular app

I'm trying to create a "User Preferences" page UI on my Angular app to allow the users to edit their data.
I understand that the user data is obtained from the token, they're called: claims
I'm using Azure AD B2C to authenticate them, i can see the user profile data but i can't modify the data.
So, i'm obtaining the user data through the claims on the token through this way:
ngOnInit() {
    this.companyName = this.authService.instance.getActiveAccount().idTokenClaims['extension_CompanyName'];
}

But i don't have any idea how to edit these claims, i don't encountered any information, only see that's is possible creating a new user flow for editing their data in Azure AD B2C, but the main idea is to stay in my app.
Any idea? Thanks!
