# Links still clickable when hamburger menu is closed

I'm using a hamburger menu as a navigation "bar" which puts the links when clicked in the middle of the screen. If the menu is closed the links are invisible but still clickable. How can I fix that?
I tried setting the z-index to a negative number when it's closed which didn't work.
