# JAWS is announcing the input type as link instead of edit

After pressing enter key for the link, the focus would be redirected to input text where I have added the aria-label as "Verification code resend was successful"
✔️ Expected result
JAWS should announce as "Verification code resend was successful Edit"
❌ Actual result
But It is announcing as "Verification code resend was successful link" which is strange and it is happening only in chrome and edge browsers and also not in all the environments.
Browser: …
Chrome and Edge
Working as expected in firefox
Note - Other screen readers are working as expected.
