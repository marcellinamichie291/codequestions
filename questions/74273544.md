# YARN and NPM Stuck at ready after yarn dev / npm run dev

This problem happened to me today second time after a while, when I get into any project, and type yarn dev or npm run dev, I get stuck at:
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000

Last time, only way I was able to fix this was to reinstall my laptop completely... hope anyone can help... I didn't install anything or change anything, it just happened randomly after I backed up my folder with projects to google drive... i was using next.js
