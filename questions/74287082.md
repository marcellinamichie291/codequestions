# How do I replace multiple elements?

For example,
    string myString1 = "abcdef";
    string myString2;
    myString2 = myString1.Replace("a", "abc").Replace("b", "bcd");

The output will be "abcdcbcdcdef".
I want my output to be "abcbcdcdef".
I know that you could do that with a StringBuilder, but is there
a shorter version?
I need to do this with a large number of characters (> 100).
