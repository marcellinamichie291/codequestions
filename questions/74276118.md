I converted my Pygame into dmg with py2app but it has a major problem when converted, game is working fine but when you right-click the app and click show package contents inside the contents folder there is all my game file ( like txt, wav, mp4 ). I dont want my user to see and edit the text files and it contains all the game history because of it the user can mess with the game history. Is there a way to hide all the game files while converting the pygame to dmg with py2app
