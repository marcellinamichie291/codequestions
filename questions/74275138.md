# Remove Intellij Idea project history and settings

If (in Intellij Idea 2002.2) I try to "Open or Import" a new java project which I just unzipped after downloading it from https://start.spring.io/ and this project happens to have the same name of a project that I previously loaded with intellij but that I removed and deleted its files since then, Intellij still recognizes it as the old project and will handle it as an existing intellij project... why? and how do I make it stop?
