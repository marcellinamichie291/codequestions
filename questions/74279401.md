# tradingview webhook for Telegram

Can you tell me the conditions for sending signals from strategy to webhooks?
    strategy.entry("Long Entry", strategy.long)
    alert(kh.telegram_message("0000000","{{exchange}}:{{ticker}}, price = , volume = {{volume}} "))
    strategy.exit("Long Exit", "Long Entry", stop=longStop, limit=longTarget, trail_points=trailingPoint, trail_offset=trailingOffset, comment_profit="Target", comment_loss="Stop", comment_trailing="Trailing Stop")
    alert(kh.telegram_message("00000000","{{exchange}}:{{ticker}}, price = , volume = {{volume}} "))

The webhook arrives, but This part comes as a string. Why aren't alerts listed as this value? Is my conditional expression wrong? ㅠㅠ
