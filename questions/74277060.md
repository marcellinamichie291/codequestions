# Run sequence of kernels in loop in OpenCL

I'm programming molecular dynamics simulation which is basically loop composed mostly of calls to two kernels 1. kernel_evalForce() and 2. kernel_updatePosition(). Between these calls must be global memory synchronization which makes sure that forces are up-to-date for all threads.
for( int i=0; i<nMaxIter; i++ ){
   kernel_evalForce();
   // global memory must be synchronized before we proceed
   force_residual = kernell_reduceForce();
   if(force_residual < force_converged) break;
   kernel_updatePosition();
}

Is there a way how to enque whole loop composed of n repeated calls to these kernels rather than enque each call to each kernell individually?
My motivation is to minimize the overhead of CPU-GPU communication since I expect execution time of each individual kernel to be rather small.
Alternatively I was thinking to write the whole loop inside one big kernel.
_kernell( atom_pos, atom_forces ){
   // paraelization over atoms, each tread takes care of one atom
   const int iG = get_global_id (0);  
   for( int i=0; i<nMaxIter; i++ ){
      atom_forces[iG] = evalForce(atom_pos);
      CLK_GLOBAL_MEM_FENCE;
      force_residual = reduce_force(atom_forces);
      dt = chooseTimeStep(force_residual);
      if(force_residual < force_converged) break;
      CLK_GLOBAL_MEM_FENCE;      
      atom_forces[iG] = updatePosition( dt, atom_pos, atom_forces ); 
   }
}

but I think this may be problem because assuming there is much more atoms than GPU-cores, CLK_GLOBAL_MEM_FENCE may block to proceed processing atoms further? Or maybe I don't exactly know what is CLK_GLOBAL_MEM_FENCE waiting for ?
