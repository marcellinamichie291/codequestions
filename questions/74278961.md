# Anylogic model ceases execution at a specified time

I don't know why the models stop working at this time of 127.33 days.
The model typically runs when I remove this code from the flowcharts, but when I added it, the model halted at the specified time.
Code:
while ( !collection.isEmpty() )
{
Order order = collection.getFirst();
if ( products > 0 )
{
if ( order.amount <= products )
{
order.retailer.products += order.amount;
traceln("order.amount fel backorder: " +order.amount + " for : " +order.retailer);
// remove the demand from the queue
collection.removeFirst();
}
}
}


I've attempted to add code using an event that checks the inventory level is greater than 0 every day, but I've encountered the same issue.
