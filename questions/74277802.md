# Facebook API client_pages in new page experience doesn't work

To access someone's page in Facebook we use the client_pages endpoint. Facebook has been rolling out the new page expierence for pages for a while now. We found out that there is currently no notification coming in on a page when we execute the post request on the client_pages endpoint.

When we restore a page to the old page experience, the notification will come in and you can simply accept our request. You can also accept the request via: page -> settings -> page roles.
For pages on the new page expierence we have not yet been able to discover where this can be accepted. Reverting to the old page experience is not a solution either, as the content created on the new page experience will disappear.
Does anyone have the same problem?
