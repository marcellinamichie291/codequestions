# :has and :contains jQuery selectors not working in Chrome dev tools

The :has and :contains jQuery selectors typed into the find element field of the Elements tab of the Chrome dev tools after pressing Ctrl+F is not finding anything. Aren't these selectors supported in Chrome dev tools?
div:has(strong:contains("pfx"))
