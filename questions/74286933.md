# Python How to match all text between two strings in multiline

I'm having a bit of trouble getting a Python regex to work when matching against text that spans multiple lines.
The example text is ('\n' is a newline)
speakerC：SHAKSDHKWJHFKJWHFKJWFJ\n
speakerA：SHAKSDHKWJHFKJWHFKJWFJ\n
speakerA：Let's beginning to do some thing.\n ----> I want to capture from here
[there may have a variable number of lines here]\n
(voting)
listA：\n
listB：JIJFEOPFOJEWFJ\n
listC：KFOEKOFKWPKEPW\n
listD：JIJFEOPFOJEWFJ\n
JIOFJOWEJ\n
listE：KFOEKOFKWPKEPW\n
votA:\n
[there may have a variable number of lines here or empty]\n
votB:\n
[there may have a variable number of lines here or empty]\n
votC:\n
[there may have a variable number of lines here or empty]\n
(repeat the above a few hundred times)

I want to capture all of speakerA until votC.
However, I only can capture :
speakerA：Let's beginning to do some thing.\n.
[there may have a variable number of lines here]\n
(voting)

here is pattern:
pattern = re.compile(r'(^speakerA：.*\n(.*\n)?^（voting）)', re.MULTILINE)
