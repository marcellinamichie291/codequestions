# How to extend the vocabulary of a pretrained transformer model?

I would like to extend a zero-shot text classification (NLI) model's vocabulary, to include domain-specific vocabulary or just to keep it up-to-date. For example, I would like the model to know the names of the latest COVID-19 variants are related to the topic 'Healthcare'.
I've added the tokens to the tokenizer and resized the token embeddings. However, I don't know how to finetune the weights in the embedding layer, as suggested here.
To do the finetuning, can I use simply use texts containing a mixture of new vocabulary and existing vocabulary, and have the tokenizer recognise the relations between tokens through co-occurrences in an unsupervised fashion?
Any help is appreciated, thank you!
