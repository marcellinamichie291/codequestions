# It is necessary that the extension to be deleted should be deleted like this: 1) open the bat file 2) enter the extension 3) gives some value

How it works: Open the bat file on the command line and type the extension on the same line before opening the bat file.
@echo off
REM turning off the output of commands to the screen
if "%1"=="" echo Extension not introduced
REM if you do not enter anything, the extension is not entered
if not exist "*.%1" echo No files found
REM if you entered an extension that does not exist, it will give you no files found.
DEL /Q "*.%1"
REM delete files with the specified extension without confirmation


It is necessary that the extension is not entered immediately but only after I open the bat file and he asked me to enter the extension
