# How do I get the type of the executing Controller in MVC .Net Core?

In my own DI I am trying to fork code based on whether the current request is executing in the context of an anoymous request or not. I guessed the easiest way would be to infer the type of the current controller and see if it was a subtype of our own anonymous api controller:
public bool InAnonymousContext() {
  var anonymousContext = false;
  if (_actionContextAccessor?.ActionContext != null)
  {
    var controllerContext = new ControllerContext(_actionContextAccessor.ActionContext);

    var type = controllerContext.ActionDescriptor.ControllerTypeInfo?.GetType();
                
    anonymousContext = type.IsSubclassOf(typeof(AbstractAnonymousApiController)) ?? false;
  }

  return anonymousContext;
} 

but I've made a wrong assumption that IActionContextAccessor would be available to me from DI.
Any ideas how to go about this?
