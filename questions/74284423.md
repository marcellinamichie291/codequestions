# Save distance between sets of coordinates to new column

I have a bunch of coordinates in my dataframe that look like this:

Start_Lat: 43.11944
Start_Lng: -75.2932
End_Lat: 43.12029
End_lng: -75.2935

I am basically wanting to create a new column in my dataframe that has the distance between the two sets of coordinates in km (see below example).

Distance: 0.0984

This is what I have tried so far:
import geopy.distance as gd
coords_1 = data['Start_Lat'].astype(str) +", "+ data["Start_Lng"].astype(str)
coords_2 = data['End_Lat'].astype(str) +", "+ data["End_Lng"].astype(str)
data['Distance'] = gd(coords_1, coords_2)

Sadly this is not working though... Any idea where I am going wrong?
