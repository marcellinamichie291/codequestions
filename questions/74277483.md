# Why is Jest ignoring my 2nd mock return value?

I have the following code (which I've stripped down to its basics):
const writeWiremockMappingFiles = async (customerData) => {
console.log({customerData})
  const PAXEntitlementFile = await createPAXGetEntFile(customerData, SRec, entitlementsSessionID);
};

const transform = async () => {
  for (const customer of sourceData.Customers) {
    const customerData = mapFromSourceData(customer);
    writeWiremockMappingFiles(customerData);
  });
};

module.exports = {
  transform,
};

with the following unit test (again stripped down):
it.only('should call each of the populate template functions with the customer data as received from "mapFromSourceData"â€™, async () => {
    const flushPromises = () => new Promise(setImmediate);
    sourceData.Customers = [{}, {}];

    mapFromSourceData.mockReset();

    mapFromSourceData
      .mockReturnValueOnce(customerData1)
      .mockReturnValueOnce(customerData2);

  await transform();
  await flushPromises();

  expect(createPAXGetEntFile).toHaveBeenCalledWith(customerData1, SRec1, entitlementsID1);
  expect(createPAXGetEntFile).toHaveBeenCalledWith(customerData2, SRec2, entitlementsID2);
});

The 1st assertion works fine. The 2nd blows up because it is matching against the 1st and not the 2nd mocked value as it should. The console.log call shows that writeWiremockMappingFiles is visited twice as expected but in both cases it is being fed the 1st record 'CustomerData1'. 'CustomerData2' is ignored.
