# Why npm doesn't let me to install any package individually in windows 11?

I just switched to windows 11 but there's something weird going on.Each time I attempt to install any npm package which throws me error like below.(Angular project created from scratch in this example via ng new command).
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! syscall spawn bash
npm ERR! file bash
npm ERR! path bash
npm ERR! errno -4058
npm ERR! electron@21.2.1 postinstall: `node install.js`
npm ERR! spawn bash ENOENT
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the electron@21.2.1 postinstall script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:

I attempted to install electron via running npm i electron which thrown me error like above
Also tried some other packages to install via npm install but always fails.
I played around current angular,node(used LTS also) and npm versions but nothing did work.So since only OS changed from win10 to win11 I think win11 is problem here but why and how?Please help me.
