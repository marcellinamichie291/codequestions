# How to parse a custom schema

I have a custom schema, stored in a json file. I want to parse that schema. Unfortunately, that schema is an enterprise product, so I cannot find a way to parse it. Any approach how to parse a custom schema, I am quite stuck at this point.
One of the example of such schema is following:
{
    typeid:org.name:prop1.0.0,
    properties : {
         typevalue:Float64,
         length:4,
         typeid:element,
         description:"List to store elements"
    }
}

One thing I was able to figure out that the typeid is analogous to $id in json-schema. So I think I can parse that. But I am unsure about the others.
