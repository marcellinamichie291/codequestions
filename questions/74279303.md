Dears,
How to disable a input field according to another select field value Python/PySimpleGUI.
Here's the aim of this script : Once an Entry is selected from first "Combo list", it will disable the corresponding entery , either the 2nd or 3rd or both , below is an attempt for my script to achieve that, Unfortunately need additional adjustement in events loop to make it happen. Could you please support on that :
import PySimpleGUI as sg

 layout = [

[sg.Text('Filed 1:', size=(15,1)), sg.Combo(['DisableField2', 'DisableField3', 
'DisableField2&3'], size=(25, 1), key='FIELD1')],
[sg.Text('Field 2:', size=(15,1)), sg.Input(key='FIELD2', size=(25,1))],
[sg.Text('Field 3:', size=(15,1)), sg.Input(key='FIELD3', size=(25,1))],
],

window = sg.Window('MAIN',  layout, finalize=True,element_justification='c')


while True:
event, values = window.read()
print(event, values)

if event == sg.WIN_CLOSED or event == 'Exit':
    break

elif event == 'FIELD1':
    window['FIELD1'].update(result2.upper())
    if event == 'DisableField2':
        window['FIELD1'].config(state="disable")
    elif event == 'DisableField3':
        window['FIELD1'].config(state="disable")
    elif event == 'DisableField2&3':
        window['FIELD1'].config(state="disable")
window.close()
