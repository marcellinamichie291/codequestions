# Is it possible to use @Transactional annotation on aspect method instead of service method?

I have a micro-service project and I am adding a common feature to every service. For that I wrote code in my common service and it works fine as long as I put @Transactional annotation on every method in service classes of all my services. This is very annoying cause I have to annotate lots of methods in many places. Is it possible to use annotation just once and it will be applied to other methods? Let's say to annotate a method of aspect that intercepts all necessary methods?
I tried to use annotation in my aspect but it does not work...But I still think that there is should be some way to solve this problem.
