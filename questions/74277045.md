# Transform the DB to Eloquent relationship

Good day to all laravel dev;
I created a joining table in my controller but, it's to long, is there's a way to recreate this query in eloquent relationship? I tried many tutorials but no luck for me, or any better solution to my query. Thank you.
Below is the tables in my database:

+table1
-id
-column

+table2
-id
-table1_id
-column

+table3
-id
-table1_id
-column


below is my code in the controller:
public function something() {
      $something_var = DB::table('table1')->leftjoin(table2, table1.id, '=', table2.table1_id)->rightjoin(table3, table1.id, '=', table3.id)->paginate(10);
}
