# Using webpack, how to alias a require used by a loader?

I'm progressively converting my Vue2 code to Vue3 and for the time being I converted one entrypoint entirely.
In my package.json, I have vue that points to Vue3 and vue2 that is, well, Vue2.
In my code, I use the resolve.alias webpack config field so that when old code requires Vue, it requires Vue2 and new code will automatically require Vue3 without changing anything.
My remaining problem:
The Vue2 code uses vue-loader which calls the vue-template-compiler package. This package has a require('vue') which calls Vue3 and I have no idea how to override this.
