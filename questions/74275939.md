# How to get all records with the last two dates

I have a table with dates and some other information, where the dates are not continuous (no weekends). How do I get all records from the last two days/dates (which I don't necessarily know beforehand)?
While
SELECT datum FROM trackproc ORDER BY datum DESC LIMIT 1;
gives me the last date, and
SELECT datum FROM trackproc ORDER BY datum DESC LIMIT 1,1;
the second last one, which is what I want, this statement
SELECT * FROM trackproc 
WHERE datum BETWEEN (SELECT datum FROM trackproc ORDER BY datum DESC LIMIT 1) 
            AND     (SELECT datum FROM trackproc ORDER BY datum DESC LIMIT 1,1) 
ORDER BY datum;

returns empty.
How would I write such a statement?
