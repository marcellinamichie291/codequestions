# How to avoid circular dependencies when switching Scenes in JavaFX?

Suppose I have class A and class B. Class A is for building scene A and class B is for building scene B. Scene A should have a button to switch to scene B and scene B should have a button to switch to scene A. Now I wonder how I should implement this without having a circular dependency between class A and B. Is this even possible?
