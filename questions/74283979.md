# Angular12 i18n translations during bootstrap

Upgraded from Angular 9 to Angular 12.
The following code in main.ts worked in Angular 9 to allow the application to do translations.  However it is not working in Angular 12.
let locale = Cookie.get('lang');

  fetch('/assets/locale/messages.de.xlf').then(r => r.text()).then(t => {
    let options = null;
    if (locale && locale == 'de') {
      options = {
        providers: [
          {provide: TRANSLATIONS, useValue: t},
          {provide: TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT, useValue: 'xlf'},
          {provide: LOCALE_ID, useValue: locale}
        ]
      };
    }
    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, options).catch(err => console.log(err));
  });

The polyfill has been added to polyfill.ts.  The build configuration has "aot": false
Here is a sample of what the html looks like:
<div class="page-title"><h1 class="tc" i18n="@@LoginTitle">Login</h1></div>

Any ideas?
