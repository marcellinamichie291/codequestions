# How to implement RoutePolicy in Camel

Which are the minimal parts needed to implement a single RoutePolicy in Camel that starts the route?
I have tried to implement the hints given in How do I start a Camel route with autoStartup=false, but

there seems to be no effect, as measured by ServiceHelper.isStarted

the shutdown of the route needs to be forced

Forcing shutdown of ExecutorService: org.apache.camel.util.concurrent.RejectableThreadPoolExecutor@3763e0ea[Shutting down, pool size = 1, active threads = 1, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0][queue_name] due first await termination elapsed.
Cannot completely force shutdown of ExecutorService: org.apache.camel.util.concurrent.RejectableThreadPoolExecutor@3763e0ea[Shutting down, pool size = 1, active threads = 1, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0][queue_name] due second await termination elapsed.




Regarding shutdown: this can be solved by extending notify by e.g.
  if (event instanceof CamelContextStoppingEvent)
  {
     for (Route route : routes)
     {
        if (shouldStartRoute(route))
        {
           ServiceHelper.stopService(route.getConsumer());
        }
     }
  }
