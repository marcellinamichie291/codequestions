# how I can make a Django project in ubuntu by Java?

Well...
In my toy project, I want to make a Django project in ubuntu server by java
`
ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder();
builer.command("sh","-c","django-admin startproject helloWorld");
builder.directory(new File(/home/ubuntu/toy_service));

try {
  builder.start();
} catch(IOException e) {e.getMessage();}

`
I check process builder activate command such as touch, ls, cd etc...
But django-admin never activate ever.
I check django is installed on my server and I can make a django project on linux shell
How can I make a django project?
