# Update service reference error "interface not supported"

I added a field to a table in the SQL Server database of a web site.
The web site works well.
Now I need to update the service reference of a WCF utility that communicates with the website.
In Solution Explorer (Visual Studio 2019) I go in the "Service references" of the project, there is only ONE element, I right-click over, appears the context menu, I select "Update ..." and I obtain an error: "Interface not supported" with no explanations.
And the WCF application of course fails communicating with the web site.
I'm completely ignorant abot WCF, all the code was written by another developer now "gone".
Any suggestion?
