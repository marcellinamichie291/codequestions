# how to dynamically save and load find-tuned models server-side?

I would like to fine-tune a model specifically to a users input (f.e stable diffusion) and save that tuned model persistently on cloud storage or s3 after  - then i want to be able to (down)load it back into memory for inference anytime later - how would i go about that setup? Also are there some serverless setups to design this for autoscalability? (correct me on any level if there are wrong assumptions)
