# If a JavaScript function returns a promise, can I make it async instead of using try/catch clauses in the function?

I have a function that may throw exceptions. On successful execution my function will return a promise. I want to handle any function exceptions or a promise rejection the in the same catch block later in the code.
I could add a try block in the function and on any caught exception return a rejected promise, e.g.
function foo(x) {
  try {
    // code here may throw an exception
    return myPromise(x.y)
  }
  catch (ex) {
    return Promise.reject(ex)
  }
}

I can then use foo(x).catch(ex => { /* handler here */})
Alternatively I could make the function async, resulting in any function exceptions producing a foo() promise rejection, e.g.
async function foo(x) {
    // code here may throw an exception
    return myPromise(x.y)
}

I can handle exceptions and rejections as before. Is there any drawbacks in the second approach?
