# why split Method doesn't work with my code?

I am trying to virtualize and clean the stackOverFlow survey so I am trying to split the languages in the data by pandas and it didn't work and keep showing me this error
'float' object has no attribute 'split'
what is the problem here!
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('survey_results_public.csv')
langResponces = data['LanguageHaveWorkedWith']
languageCounter = Counter()
for response in langResponces:
    languageCounter.update(response.split(';'))
