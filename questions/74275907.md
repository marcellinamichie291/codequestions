# Issues using PHP simplexml_load_file to parse a podcast feed

I was using some code I knocked up to parse some podcast feeds and only get the first episode and in the past week, presumably due to changes in the feeds, it simply stopped working...
The code is as follows and I've tried many things after reading the PHP docs to get it working again but I seem to be going down a rabbit hole of making things worse...
Anyone able to help?
Thank you
<?php 
header('Content-Type: application/xml');
$output = '<rss xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" version="2.0">';
/* IGN */
$xmlIGN = simplexml_load_file('https://api.spokenlayer.com/feed/channel/ign-podcasts-ext/3c9929b72538c12bd92ac6762f8d798b9d4e8cdca7692ea74f466061d01816cb');
$IGN = ($xmlIGN->channel->item[0]);
print_r ($output);
print_r ('<channel>');
print_r ($IGN->asXML());
print_r ('</channel></rss>');
?>

After throwing in some test tags it appears to be erroring at the simplexml_load_file but uncertain why...
