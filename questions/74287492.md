# How to convert single quoted string representation of dict to a double quoted dict

I have this string
temp = "{'box_version': 'v6_3zc', 'box_sub_version': None, 'box_number': 'A4BQ', 'box_usage_type': None, 'version': 6, 'current_state': None}"

I am trying to convert it to a dict with double quoted keys and values.
I have tried json.loads,  json.dumps and ast.literal_eval() nothing seems to work for my usecase. Other answer's final result ends in single quoted dict.
