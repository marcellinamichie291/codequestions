I want to change []string into [][]byte
bytes := make([][]byte, 0, len(dataList))
for _, data := range dataList {
   b := []byte(data)
   bytes = append(bytes, b)
}

but everytime b output the same and how to slove it ? Thanks!
for _, data := range dataList {
   newData := data
   b := []byte(newData)
   bytes = append(bytes, b)
}

it can't work either...
