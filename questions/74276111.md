# Grep list of servers from file in path directory

I have contents in a path directory which consist of below data, I am preparing a script where I don't need to give full path to get data but it does not work, pls help out.
Data is in below path..
cat /usr/bin/data/server
Production    10.188.70.100  Active
Finance       10.188.70.101  Active
Sales         10.188.70.102  Active
Marketing     10.188.70.103  Active

Preparing script like below to have these data by entering one word instead of path. Like if I enter grab Finance (where grab is a word) it will show as below.
Finance       10.188.70.101  Active

My script:
#!/bin/bash

cat /usr/bin/data/server | grep $1
done

When I run the above script it gives me an error:
$ grab Finance
-bash: get: command not found
