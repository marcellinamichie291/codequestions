# Create New socket connection when refreshing page

I am using https://github.com/webtutsplus/videoChat-WebFrontend library to implement video calls on my project. I'm that when the first time 2 user connect at that time it's working properly but when we refresh that page at that time socket create a new connection and it's not working.
So Anyone gives me a solution?
Thanks.
