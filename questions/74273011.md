# Why does Mutating Webhook require both parent resource and subresource?

This is related to Dynamic Admission Control.
Mutating the status subresource in mutating admission webhook requires both parent resource and subresource, for eg - Node and Node/status present in the webhook i.e.:
...
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
    apiVersions:
  - v1
    operations:
  - CREATE
  - UPDATE
    resources:
  - nodes
  - nodes/status
    ...

If I try to specify just nodes in the webhook, the status is not updated (status can be updated for node, see Advertise Extended Resources for a Node). Whereas if I include both resource and the subresource, the mutation is successful.
I was able to find: 
Kubernetes: Is it possible to mutate the status subresources in the mutation admission webhooks?
regarding this but, it too does not mention the reason for doing so.
What is the reason to add both parent resource and subresource for modifying the status subresource?
