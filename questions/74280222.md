# Compile the same project under gcc and nvcc

I have a regular C project containing a bunch of C files alongside with some parts in CUDA.
Those parts have a fallback in regular C (cuda parts are in .cu files and C parts in .c files).
Both the cuda file and the fallback share the same header, using #ifdef __CUDACC__ preprocessive if needed.
I want to be able to compile the project both for computers not supporting cuda and those supporting it.
For that I compile with nvcc the .cu files and with gcc the .c files to .o and I link the final project with the compiler needed.
The issue here is that when compiling (or linking) .c files, nvcc falls back to gcc and forgets about the cuda parts.
PS: the project is compiled using make
Using the technique described before, I can compile the regular c program but the compilation with nvcc fails.
One of the possibilities I already tried is to copy all the .c files to .cu temporarily before compilation but it is a very dirty way to do it. What is the most conventional method I should use ?
I already searched other topics like this, but most of them answer to the problem with one single file.
