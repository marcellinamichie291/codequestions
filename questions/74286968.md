# Apply cumsum function using condition

I am trying to calculate the maximum number of aircraft on the ground simultaneously throughout the year per station, knowing that I have more than 300 stations and that the data is per (day and hours) for 1 year.
So I thought of this solution: find the maximum per day and per station then extract the maximum per station.
my data are in this format: station, aircraft ,time , type ( arrive to the station or depart from the station) and value is 1 if is arrival and -1 if is depart, I create this column to facilitate the count, the idea is apply cumsum once the data are sorted by time for each station.

I need to create a function which group the data by day and by station and count the cumulative sum,  but I have planes that have been sleeping in the station, so I need to delete them( the yellows lines in the screenshot).
The trick to detect these planes:
Aircraft allows us to track the plane:
generally it appears twice a day when it arrives and when it leaves.
to detect these planes that I have to look
the variables: Aircraft and Type:
if the type is departure and the aircraft variable of this line appears only once in this day, ( it means there is no arrival for this flight)  then I should not count them.
I was thinking to create a function: to group by (station and time) then apply cumsum but skipping the lines with the conditions that I explained before.(if the type is departure and the aircraft variable of this line appears only once in this day, then I should not count them)
Any Help??
