# How to replace the links inside of a file by sed command

I have a file named 1.txt and it contains below 3 URLs, each of them following a http link, which I want to change them using sed command. The link could be regard as a string without space.
  URL1: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zw5ZK.png
  URL2: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cT8Pv.png
  URL3: https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3Syn.png

My purpose is to use something like below to replce those 3 links from command line, like:
sed **** 1.txt https://abc/1.png https://abc/2.png https://abc/3.png

After the command executes, the new content of 1.txt would be:
  URL1: https://abc/1.png
  URL2: https://abc/2.png
  URL3: https://abc/3.png
