# Verifying toast message in Tosca

I scanned toast message object in Tosca and I used it in my test cases.that same popup will appear twice in the flow.
First time Tosca is able to validate the popup but for second one I'm getting error as container was not found.
If I run the 2nd popup flow seperately Tosca is able to validate it.but if i run the whole flow it fails with the mentioned error.
Need some help here .....
I want Tosca to identify and validate the toast popup without any error
