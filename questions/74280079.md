I'm trying to enable Screen Sharing on my Macbook Pro, but all I find around the internet is how to enable Remote Management. I know I can do this through the GUI but I am using ssh to access the Macbook, and want to enable it through the terminal.
I tried using kickstarter, but it only enables it for Remote Management.
