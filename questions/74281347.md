# MS Access count number of records by month over the last five years where record date > select month

I need to show the number of valid inspectors we have by month over the last five years. Inspectors are considered valid when the expiration date on their certification has not yet passed, recorded as the month end date. The below SQL code is text of the query to count valid inspectors for January 2017:
SELECT Count(*) AS RecordCount
FROM dbo_Insp_Type
WHERE (dbo_Insp_Type.CERT_EXP_DTE)>=#2/1/2017#);

Rather than designing 60 queries, one for each month, and compiling the results in a final table(or, err, query) are there other methods I can use that call for less manual input?
