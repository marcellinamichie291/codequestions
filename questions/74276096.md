# How can I client edit/update information on a website I built for them easily without having to contact me?

Just a quick question. I would like to know if there is any easy, user-friendly way or method - without messing up the whole website by accident - that a client could edit a WordPress website if I were to build one for them. The only way I can think of at the moment is for them to contact me and I update it for them, as I don't think it'd be a great idea to hand the client the WordPress admin credentials and let them do it themselves - unless they asked for it of course.
Thanks guys.
