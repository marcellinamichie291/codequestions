# Jquery square bracket selector syntax: is there a syntax for "Or" operation?

I have the following code to handle events for dynamically added elements.
$('#ContainerDiv').on('change', '[id="one"]', handler);
$('#ContainerDiv').on('change', '[id="two"]', handler);
$('#ContainerDiv').on('change', '[id="three"]', handler);

What I want is something like
$('#ContainerDiv').on('change', '[id="one || two || three"]', handler);

Is there a syntax to do it?
(Also, what is this "square bracket selector" syntax called? I found it in the answer the following question but does not know the name of this syntax so I couldn't research myself for my question.
