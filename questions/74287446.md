# Set nav bar to the right

so i am trying to imitate googles search page. I want to move the navbar to start on the TOP right. So that would be the 'Image and advanced search' buttons.
It always starts top left which I understand. but when I use the 'float:right' inside the CSS it moves to the right, but then drops lower to be inline with the google logo image. I want it to stay top right.
I can't post images yet because of my reputation score.
Here is the html of my code :
<nav class="nav">
                <div class="index">
                   <a href="image.html">Images</a>      
                </div>   
                <a href="advanced.html">Advanced search</a>
            </nav>
          
        <div class="logo">
            <img src="google logo.png" alt="Google search">
        </div>

Here is the CSS of the logo and the navbar:

    .nav {
     padding: 10px;
     margin-right: 25px;
     float: right;
    }
.logo {
  padding: 20px;
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width:30%;
}


I tried using float: right. It moved the navbar right but also inline with the logo and not top right.
I tried using margins
