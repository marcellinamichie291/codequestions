# Limit jar size in AWS Lambda functions with many code reuse permutations

We have many Lambda functions written in Java, which reuse code in many permutations: Lambda functions A and B use a common piece of code, Lambda functions B and C use another common piece of code, etc.
If we put all this reused code in each Lambda, or in a Layer that's used by all Lambdas, each cold start of a Lambda loads a lot of code that's not used by that Lambda, causing a significant delay in the cold start.
It is quite a puzzle to manually move all code to Layers or dependencies that are only used in the Lambdas that need them, because of the many permutations, which also change over time as our code evolves.
Is there a mechanism that (at build time) for each Lambda generates a jar without all the unused code (thus by pruning all the code that's not used by this Lambda)?
Or is there another solution for this problem?
