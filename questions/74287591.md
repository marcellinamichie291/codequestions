# How do I publish Joomla on free hosting?

I am trying to publish a page stored locally in Joomla on free hosting. I have tried with 000webhost and have followed the steps of various tutorials with success. The problem is that when starting the page it presents the following error:
Warning: include(/storage/ssd1/566/19801566/public_html/libraries/../templates/system/fatal.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /storage/ssd1/566/19801566/public_html /libraries/vendor/symfony/error-handler/ErrorRenderer/HtmlErrorRenderer.php on line 353

The URL is https://ieslapueblavicar.000webhostapp.com/
I have tried with 000webhost and have followed the steps of various tutorials with success.
I also accept advice if there is any other valid free hosting suitable for Joomla, the goal is to be able to teach it to computer science students.
