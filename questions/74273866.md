# C - While loop runs twice when it shouldn't

Hi I'm making a simple Hangman game in C
I have a while Loop that is suppose to wait for the user to input a character. However, it skips pass that on the 2nd iteration.
void startGuessing(char *word){
    char dummyWord[13];
    strcpy(dummyWord, word);

    int dummyWordLength = strlen(dummyWord);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < dummyWordLength; i++)
    {
        dummyWord[i] = '_';
    }


    int remaindingChances = 7;
    while(remaindingChances > 0){
        printf("Player 2 has so far guessed: %s\n", dummyWord);
        printf("Player 2, you have %d guesses remaining. Enter your next guess:\n", remaindingChances);

        char guess;
        guess = getchar();

        int wordLength = strlen(word);
        for (size_t i = 0; i < wordLength; i++)
        {
            if(guess == word[i]){
                dummyWord[i] = word[i];
            }
        }

        remaindingChances--;
    }
}

The following is the output I'm seeing:
Player 2 has so far guessed: ___
Player 2, you have 7 guesses remaining. Enter your next guess:
c
Player 2 has so far guessed: c__
Player 2, you have 6 guesses remaining. Enter your next guess:
Player 2 has so far guessed: c__
Player 2, you have 5 guesses remaining. Enter your next guess:

Am i doing something wrong? O.o I can't seem to figure out this issue.
