# Is PHP OpenSSL library completely isolated and in no way linked with any OpenSSL binary on Ubuntu

We are using OpenSSL library provided by PHP.
But does this PHP OpenSSL library internally uses OpenSSL binaries that are probably provided as pre-compiled binaries with Ubuntu OS ?  Just putting in a doubt.
Just want to know that PHP OpenSSL library is completely isolated and in no way linked with any OpenSSL binary on Ubuntu ?
