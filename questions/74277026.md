# I need to constantly move a character from the left to the right of the screen without touching anything In pygame. I need loop that does that

I tried diferent technics but still don't get it. This function is in a class Player() so it moves the player from left to right automatically
    def move(self):
        dx = 0
        dy = 0
    
        # CHECKING THE RECT IF HAS HIT THE BORDERS
        if self.rect.left + dx < 0:
            pass
            # CHANGING DIRECTION TO RIGHT
        if self.rect.right + dx > SCREEN_WIDHT:
            pass
            # CHANING DIRECTION TO LEFT
        self.rect.x += dx
        self.rect.y += dy

i don't have any ideas on how to make this loop
