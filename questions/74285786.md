I was using this code to extract anything from the webpage but it will not work in extracting lik
=IMPORTXML(A2,"//*[@class='su-button su-button-style-default buttonDownload box-shadow-mod su-button-wide']")
Is there any other option so I can extract links from a button in bulk

I have tried using google sheets codes but it works only to extract text not URL
