# draw 5 meter circle on google map

I would like to draw a 5-meter circle around a location, how can I map a 5-meter radius to pixels?
const radius = //5 meters
const myCircle = new google.maps.Circle({
  strokeColor: "#FF0000",
  strokeOpacity: 0.8,
  strokeWeight: 2,
  fillColor: "#FF0000",
  fillOpacity: 0.35,
  map,
  center: myCenter,
  radius: radius,
});
