# keep some comments out of the console

I'm writing code that will be used by others later and I'd like two kinds of comments to clarify the code.

comments that will appear in the console when run so the user sees where in the process R is
comments they'll only need when they need to tweak the code

#### Recognise, select and clean needed data #### <- I would like this in the console always
source("scripts/3 Recognise rename select and clean needed data.R") # <- my question is not on using source
# this will guarantee you have the column names X Y Z in your data <- I would like to keep this out of the console 

Is there a way to keep some comments from not appearing in the console?
I searched the internet and the setting in RStudio, but found nothing that addresses this issue specifically.
