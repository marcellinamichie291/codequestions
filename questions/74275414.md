# '\' in string path disappears when trying to use it

I have a code that gets a part of a path, then uses it to load an image.
When I use the path instead of behaving as standard like expected, for example: Main Folder\SubFolder\SubSubFolder it's being used like that:Main FolderSubFolderSubSubFolder the whole '' are missing. I know that when we have a string we add a @ before so it doesn't happen but in this case I don't have a string that I write but a string that I get back.
Code:
@{
    string path = _Data.path;
    string ImgPath = path.Substring(path.LastIndexOf("Files") - 1, (path.Length - (path.LastIndexOf("Files") - 1)));

    string[] filePaths = Directory.GetFiles(path); // _Data.path
    foreach (var file in filePaths)
    {
        var temp = file;

        List<string> set1 = path.Split('\\').Distinct().ToList();
        List<string> set2 = temp.Split('\\').Distinct().ToList();

        var diff = set2.Count() > set1.Count() ? set2.Except(set1).ToList() : set1.Except(set2).ToList();
        
        <img src="~/@ImgPath/@string.Join("", diff)" />
    }
}

As you can see, ImgPath is a part of a string that I get from my database, so I can't really add a @ to it.
In addition, because it is an ASP NET project and I am in an .cshtml file, the @ is used to write c# code. How do I make the path stay with the \ when I use it to load the Image?
