# reducing time complexity to find the length of unique characters in string

I want to count all the unique characters in a given string. So for string "abcaabbd" the length should be 4.
My solution:
    public static void unique(String s){
        int max = 0;
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<Character>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            set.add(s.charAt(i));
        }
        max = set.size();
        System.out.println(max);
    }

which works fine but I was thinking if there is any way to reduct the time complexity of the operation.
