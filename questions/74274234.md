# MacOS accessibility api access via C#

Is there any libraries/frameworks/API docs for MacOs accessibility for C#?
I saw Accessibility API wrappers for swift and python, but is there any for C#?
(AXSwift, Accessibility 0.4.0).
My task is to create app for macOS, so that it will get user inputs and store information about UI elements, which user has clicked. I need to get GUI element name, class, description, parents, children, etc.
