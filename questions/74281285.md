# Try to Edit the AVD and set "hw.gpu.mode=off"

When I try to run android emulator I got following error and my emulator doesn't start at all.
Error:
Please check if you can update your video driver.
If it doesn't help, try to Edit the AVD and set "hw.gpu.mode=off".

When I set hw.gpu.mode=off then emulator starts but screen is completely blacked.
How can I overcome this issue?
Componenets which are enabled:
Hyper-V
Virtual Machine platform
Windows Hypervisor Platform
Virtualization enabled in BIOS

Besides I've tried different fixes available on internet like : disabling enabling Hyper-V & Windows Hypervisor platform including system restarts etc but none seems to work yet.
