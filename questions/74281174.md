# Stored procedure with OpenQuery

I am trying to turn a stored procedure into a temporary table to be able to merged with other tables in our server to come up with a new report. I am just wondering if anyone can provide some insight on whether the code is correct.
Currently when the code is run, I get this error:

Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 5
Incorrect syntax near 'Var1'

With this I am assuming that from select to as the code is running accurately from Select to As but I won't know until I get it to run. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated it using SQL Server. Thank you
Select * 
from openquery (Server_name,
                'EXEC Stored_procedure @user_id='''', @as_of_date=''Date'',@entity_group_list=''1;'',@entity_list=NULL,@date_basis=''TRD'',@Var2=''S;F;A;Y;E;'',@rating_designation=''PRSC''');

WITH RESULT AS
((Var1 int,
  as_of_date datetime,
  date_basis [dbo].[lookup_code],
  entity_group_list varchar(max),
  entity_list varchar(max),
  var2 varchar(max),
  user_id [dbo].[user_id],
  rating_designation [dbo].[lookup_code]
))

I have tried using changing from WITH RESULTS AS to WITH RESULTS SET but when using with results set I get an error

Incorrect syntax near SET.

I also have tried using a user-defined function
CREATE TABLE #Temp
(
    Var1 int,
    as_of_date datetime,
    date_basis [dbo].[lookup_code],
    entity_group_list varchar(max),
    entity_list varchar(max),
    var2 varchar(max),
    user_id [dbo].[user_id],
    rating_designation [dbo].[lookup_code]
)

INSERT INTO #Temp
    EXEC Stored_procedure

SELECT * FROM #Temp

and with this it doesn't work as about 3 variables contain look up code or a user id so I get the error of variables not defined. Once I defined them I usually give them turning that into
CREATE TABLE #Temp
(
    Var1 int,
    as_of_date datetime,
    date_basis varchar(max),
    entity_group_list varchar(max),
    entity_list varchar(max),
    var2 varchar(max),
    user_id varchar(max),
    rating_designation varchar(max)
)

INSERT INTO #Temp
    EXEC Stored_procedure

SELECT * FROM #Temp

The one time it ran it gave me the columns header but no data showed up at all.
Any advice is helpful.
Thank you!
