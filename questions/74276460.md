# Should the number of db connections be increased by one during testing?

I am working on a project with 800 tests on Laravel 8. When I check show status like 'Threads_connected';  the number of open connections ("Threads_connected") is 6.
When I run "sail test" the number goes up and is somewhere between 15 and 100. As I am not using parallel testing, I wonder if this is correct. For all tests that are related to a database I use "DBTransaction" trait. For unit tests I am not using any trait.
As the DBTransaction trait is closing all connections on tearDown, I would expect that the number of "Threads_connected" is only at 7 during testing.
I also have two databases for my application.
Is this an indication that something is off with the test suit of that project? Should the number of open connections only be increased by one during testing?
