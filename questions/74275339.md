Problem Statement :- You'll be given a string (str). You have to check if there is a continuous substring whose characters are vowels and having minimum length of 3.
I'm learning Java 8 so I've tried it. I got the answer but... Can you tell me if my logic was efficient? Is there any simpler or more efficient way to do this?
Here's what I tried.
String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
String str = "abcdeeafg";
String temporaryStr = str.chars()
            .collect(StringBuilder::new,(sb, c) -> sb.append((vowels.indexOf((char) c) != -1) ? (char) c : ' '), StringBuilder::append)
            .toString();
String[] arrOfStr = temporaryStr.split(" ");
Stream<String> stream = Arrays.stream(arrOfStr);
long countOfVowelSubStrings = stream.filter(s1 -> s1.length() > 2).count();
System.out.println(countOfVowelSubStrings != 0 ? "Yes" : "No");
