I am trying to add salesforce marketing cloud SDK in my android app for Push Notification with Android studio. I have used java in android studio and the sfmc sdk is in Kotlin.can I use that SDK for my app?
I have tried to used that SDK but I am getting error. Can any help me to resolve the problem.
Thanks

I have used this repository in Build.gradle (after getting error I have added this in Settings.gradle but error was not resolved)

        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-Android/repository" }
    }
}
