# How to calculate the average value in one column for the 10 maximum values in another column?

I have a dataset and the task:"Average number of major credit cards held for people with top 10 income".
dput(head(creditcard))
 structure(list(card = structure(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), levels = c("no","yes"), class = "factor"), reports = c(0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L), age = c(37.66667, 33.25, 33.66667, 30.5, 32.16667, 23.25), income = c(4.52, 2.42, 4.5, 2.54, 9.7867, 2.5), share = c(0.03326991, 0.005216942, 0.004155556, 0.06521378, 0.06705059, 0.0444384), expenditure = c(124.9833, 9.854167, 15, 137.8692, 546.5033, 91.99667), owner = structure(c(2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L), levels = c("no", "yes"), class = "factor"), selfemp = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), levels = c("no", "yes"), class = "factor"), 
 dependents = c(3L, 3L, 4L, 0L, 2L, 0L), days = c(54L, 34L,58L, 25L, 64L, 54L), majorcards = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), active = c(12L, 13L, 5L, 7L, 5L, 1L), income_fam = c(1.13, 0.605, 0.9, 2.54, 3.26223333333333, 2.5)), row.names = c("1","2", "3", "4", "5", "6"), class = "data.frame")


I tried to do the task like this
round(mean(creditcard[order(creditcard$income, decreasing = TRUE),]$majorcards[1:10]))

But my solution turned out to be inoptimal and I do not understand how it can be corrected
