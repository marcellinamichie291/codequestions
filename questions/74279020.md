# How to add a button to the Elementor Text Editor Widget

I need to add a button to the Elementor Text Editor widget that works like the Bold, Italic, Underline buttons. I need to add a <span class="numbers">[highlighted text here]</span>.
While the Elementor documentation says the widget uses the TinyMCE editor, the customization method shown on the page below didn't work for me: https://1stwebdesigner.com/how-to-add-custom-buttons-to-the-wordpress-tinymce-editor/
Is there a way to modify the widget using the functions.php file or do I need to create a custom text editor widget to get this functionality?
