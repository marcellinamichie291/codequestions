# Flutter hot restart leaves my keyboard up and can't navigate

new to flutter here.
When testing with some APIs I have some text input and when it doesn't work I get the errors and that renders my screen inactive. The screen freezes when I have the keyboard up, and then when I restart the keyboard remains up. The issue is that I have a bottom navigation board and have just started the app. I'm sure I could change the default initial locations, however this is something that has bothered me for a while. Does anyone know why this is?
Screen freezes like this due to error

After hot restart screen

I assumed that a hot restart would restart the keyboard position as well. Perhaps I am doing something completely wrong.
