# LEFT ON Case When in Pandas

i wanted to ask that if in SQL I can do like JOIN ON CASE WHEN, is there a way to do this in Pandas?
disease = [
{"City":"CH","Case_Recorded":5300,"Recovered":2839,"Deaths":2461},
{"City":"NY","Case_Recorded":1311,"Recovered":521,"Deaths":790},
{"City":"TX","Case_Recorded":1991,"Recovered":1413,"Deaths":578},
{"City":"AT","Case_Recorded":3381,"Recovered":3112,"Deaths":269},
{"City":"TX","Case_Recorded":3991,"Recovered":2810,"Deaths":1311},
{"City":"LA","Case_Recorded":2647,"Recovered":2344,"Deaths":303},
{"City":"LA","Case_Recorded":4410,"Recovered":3344,"Deaths":1066}
]

region = {"North": ["AT"], "West":["TX","LA"]}

So what i have is 2 dummy dict and i have already converted it to become dataframe, first is the name of the cities with the case,and I'm trying to figure out which region the cities belongs to.
Region|City
North|AT
West|TX
West|LA
None|NY
None|CH

So what i thought in SQL was using left on case when, and if the result is null when join with North region then join with West region.
But if there are 15 or 30 region in some country, it'd be problems i think
