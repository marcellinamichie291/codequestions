# How to join on multiple conditions in SQL?

I have two datasets, and I need to be able to join on null column values


 *there are many null values in the 'Model' column for this table







Customer
Brand
Model




Bill
Nike
Dunk


Kayla
Adidas
Shoe 2


Max
Nike





2)




SaleID
Customer
Brand
Model




1234
Mike
Puma
X3


5678
Bill
Nike
Dunk


7433
Max
Nike





I want to join entire rows from table one with table 2, where essentially all three values in a row from table 1 act as a single record to be joined with table 2. (Bill, Nike, Dunk) is one value essentially
So far I have tried:
create table blank as
select columns, 
       columns,
       columns,
from table 1 as x
left join table 2 as y
on x.customer=y.customer and x.brand=y.brand and x.model=y.model
;
quit;

The problem I am running into with this code is the join only includes rows where the 'Model' column is not null. There are many sales IDs with null 'Model' and I would like to be able to join these records.
For example, the final output of joining these tables with my code is:
| SaleID   | Customer | Brand    | Model    |
| 5678     | Bill     | Nike     | Dunk     |
Where I would like for there to be a record for Max, but since there is a null value in that column in that record it is not joined
