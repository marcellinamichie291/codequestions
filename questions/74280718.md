# move image inside imageview getting bounderies


i am working on a app and in 1 option i can load a photo to display when you scroll through items.
The permissions and loading all works fine. 
Now my photo is bigger than the imageview so i want that the user can "move" the photo to display the section he/she wants to show.
Again implementing the onTouchListerner and scrolling the photo works fine.
The problem is where to stop the moving of the photo.

I the picture above the grey part is my photo. In my case 2560x1920.
The red part is my imageview (match_parent x 85dp => 1368x255)
I have my scaletype set to CENTER_CROP resulting in a scalefactor of 0.534375
when i scroll in the image ( scrollBy(x,y) ) i can see my Y moves between -390..390 (or close by, hard to see). But that is of course only the case for this specific photo. But no matter which adding/substracting/dividing/... is do i can not seem to find out how the get this limit becuause what is absolutly do not want is the right situation in the picture above.
Does anybody have an idea to figure this out.
I found some (not a lot) examples that are suppose to work but they do not.
Mostly they work by keeping to total somewhere but still having a total is not of much use if you do not no the min/max.
ps. if possible at all (please please) a java example and not kotlin
