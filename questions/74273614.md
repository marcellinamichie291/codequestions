# How to include a PHP variable inside a MySQL statement

I'm trying to insert values in the contents table. It works fine if I do not have a PHP variable inside VALUES. When I put the variable $type inside VALUES then this doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?
$type = 'testing';
mysql_query("INSERT INTO contents (type, reporter, description) 
     VALUES($type, 'john', 'whatever')");
