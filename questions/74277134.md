# Display offline web-pages on Android

I want to display an operator manual in html format from various WebViews (or some other kind of browser) in different applications. The html manual is supplied to my system as html files and images, that will probably reside inside an apk. There might be different manuals so each manual will probably get their own wrapping apk.
Now I am thinking about how to supply the html files, and the images the html files references, from those apks to the WebView(s). Is it possible to use a ContentProvider inside the apk's to access the files from a WebView in some other application? Or how do I best provide the html content to be displayed by a WebView or some other browser?
Since there is no longer an easily accessible shared storage on Android, it seems I would need to make the html files accessible via som API such as a ContentProvider.
