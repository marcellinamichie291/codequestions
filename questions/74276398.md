# two columns with same values in different rows- how to group them

Suppose you have a data frame such as-
columnA columnB      columnC seq1   seq1:150-160 seq1:180-190 seq1   seq1:180-190 seq1:210-220 seq1   seq1:110-120 seq1:130-150 seq1   seq1:150-160 seq1:260-270 seq1   seq1:210-220 seq1:260-270
I would like to group them such that I produce a data frame which looks like this-
columnA columnB      columnC      columnD seq1   seq1:150-160 seq1:180-190 hub1 seq1   seq1:150-160 seq1:260-270 hub1 seq1   seq1:180-190 seq1:210-220 hub1 seq1   seq1:210-220 seq1:260-270 hub1 seq1   seq1:110-120 seq1:130-150 hub2
I can groupby columnA and columnB  based on their values and identify how many times a sequence is repeated in the df, but what if I want to look for same value in two columns and group those that tend to be associated with each other in such intricate way?
