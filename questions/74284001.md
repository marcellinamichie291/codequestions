# Escaping Double Quotes in HTML Event Handlers

How do I escape double quotes in an event handler in HTML?
For example, how do I properly escape the bar, which is a string literal, in the following code?
<button onclick="foo("bar")")>Click Me</button>

I can't use single quotes for the attribute value since I'm using XHTML. I could use single quotes for string literals, but I'd like to be consistent.
