# leftBarButtonItem displays on the leading?

I wanted to add a left bar button item but it is shown at the middle, how can i fix it?
At the documentation it says 'A custom bar button item that displays on the left (or leading) edge of the navigation bar when the navigation item is the top item.', but it doesn't say anything about what should i do when i want the item displays on the left.
I tried add a bar button on the left but it displays on the middle
