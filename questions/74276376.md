# Graph API SDK for .NET v6, C# Winforms

I've just installed Visual Studio Community and wanted to have a play around with C# (.net 6 LTS) and the graph API. I've created a winform for this purpose.
I've looked at the documentation and can see i need to install the SDK via nuget, but when i'm searching the repository i can't seem to see it.
Am i doing something silly?
