# (Python) Can 'array' be a variable name?

In the following example 1:
<example 1>
 import numpy as np

 np.array([0,1,2,3,4])

Is array after np. a method function?  If so, can array be used as a variable name?  Please check the the following example 2?
<example 2>
 import numpy as np

 array = np.arange(5)

 print(array)

Are 'array' in example 1 and example 2 different or same?
