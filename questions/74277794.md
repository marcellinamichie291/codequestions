# Assigning different values to sales brackets

I have a list of sales team members and need to calculate the commission.
The commission rules are as follows:

They receive 20 for each of their first 30 sales
30 for each sale between 31-40
40 for each sale between 41-50
50 for each sale between 51-60
etc

I have a total sales column and I want to split this into each bracket dynamically and essentially want to end up with the Sales column split up as in the image.
