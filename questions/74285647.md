# PnP Powershell Install-PnPApp

I have a question about "Install-PnPApp" command.
I have Pnp Powershell script in Azure function and I am connection using an Azure Active Directory registered application,
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $siteURL -ClientId $appId -Thumbprint $thumbprint -Tenant $tenant

In the next step i wanna Install app from Tennant catalog:
Get-PnPApp -Identity .... | Install-PnPApp

It doesn't give me error, but when i go to site collection, then I see the app is being installed, but it stays in "Installing" step, it never complete installation.
Is it possible to use Install-PnPApp if I connect with Azure Active Directory registered application?
Thank you, Matjaz Reberc
