# semantic versions for the wheel file contains devNN

I'm trying to create a python package with the following python setup.py bdist_wheel. The wheel file is generated under my_py_lib-0.0.2.dev19-py2.py3-none-any.whl. The semantic version is appearing as 0.0.2.dev19. However the dev19 is also appearing.
How do i remove this value if dev19 ?
