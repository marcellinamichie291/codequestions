# Getting error that blocks commands: driver.close:26: maximum nested function level reached; increase FUNCNEST?

I'm getting started with python and selenium and after a while of testing this code I started to get the titled error and it won't let me run my code anymore "driver.close:26: maximum nested function level reached; increase FUNCNEST?".
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options


options = webdriver.ChromeOptions() 
options.headless = True
driver = webdriver.Chrome("/Users/user/Desktop/db2/chromedriver-3", options=options)

driver.implicitly_wait(20)

def lookUp(link):
    driver.get(ink) 
    S = lambda X: driver.execute_script('return document.body.parentNode.scroll' +X)
    driver.set_window_size(S('Width'), S('Height'))
    driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'body').screenshot('ans1.png');
    driver.close()
    return

#test
lookUp('https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html')



I thought I closed the driver but perhaps I wasn't doing it properly? Each time I run it the integer, currently 26, increases. I started putting driver.close() all over the place but I don't really know how to approach closing the currently open drivers if that's the problem. Currently clueless, any help appreciated thanks!
