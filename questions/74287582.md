# R crashes when install xlsx

When I try to install the package xlsx I get fatal error and R server session disconnected.
It shows both the bomb with fatal error and server session diconnected even though I am just running it locally.
I am running r studio with r version 4.2.2 Patched.
Any known work arounds? It also did not work for version 4.2.2.
