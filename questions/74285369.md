# Prepending minus sign to Number Instance without using instance of check?

Without using instance of check ,against each child of Number class,i need to convert the Number instance to another or same Number instance by appending -(minus) sign at the begining. Have tried to use Polymorphism by referring
interface I {
  void do();
}

class A implements I { void do() { doA() } ... }
class B implements I { void do() { doB() } ... }
class C implements I { void do() { doC() } ... }

but i can't as we cannot modify child classes of Number abstract class
Have tried defining child of Number class as
public abstract class SignedNumber extends Number {
    public abstract void convertToSignedNumber();
}

//caller 
SignedNumber temp=(SignedNumber) result;
temp.convertToSignedNumber();  

Inner instance of Number cannot be assigned to 'SignedNumber' as Number implementations wont extend SignedNumber
Method overloading wont helps here too
   private Number getMinusSignAppendedNumberInstance(Number result) {
        result=convertToSignedNumber(result);//compile error,expects typecasting
        return result;
    }

    private Number convertToSignedNumber(Integer result) {
    }
    private Number convertToSignedNumber(Double result) {
    }
    private Number convertToSignedNumber(BigDecimal result) {
    } ...etc...  

Any OOP principles can i adapt to deligate instance checks at Runtime ?
Context is i need to evaluate the signed expression(https://stackoverflow.com/a/74263711/1523263) like -4+3,here 4 token is read and for this Number instance i need to append - sign which is parent of 4 in tree form .  
     +
  -     3
4
