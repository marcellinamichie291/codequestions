# Sending two http request one after another

I have 2 api calls which i want to send one after the other.
I need a response of the 1st one to send the 2nd api request, but i also need the data from first call. Looks like switchMap is the way to go, atm it looks like this:
this.apiCall1().pipe(switchMap(res1 => this.apiCall2(res.data))).subscribe(res => ...)

but i need to assign the res1.differentData to a variable which seems impossible with switchMap. Or maybe im just missing some syntax.
