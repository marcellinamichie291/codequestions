# Log for values of @DS_START_DATE / @DS_END_DATE

I'm in the process of analyzing costs that are produced by the usage of Data Studio (now Looker Studio). For that I'm looking at the BigQuery audit logs.
I can find the query that Data Studio is firing, which may look something like this:
SELECT * FROM (
SELECT clmn10_, SUM(clmn26_) AS clmn100000_ FROM (
SELECT * FROM (
SELECT t0.customer AS clmn10_, t0.my_metric1 AS clmn26_, t0.my_dim2 AS clmn39_, t0.product AS clmn6_ FROM (
SELECT *
FROM `mytable`
WHERE date(_PARTITIONTIME) >= PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', @DS_START_DATE)
AND date(_PARTITIONTIME) <= PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', @DS_END_DATE)
) t0
) WHERE ((clmn6_ = "value1") AND (clmn39_ = false))
) GROUP BY clmn10_
) LIMIT 20000000

Now that's a great start, but I would like to better understand the usage of @DS_START_DATE and @DS_END_DATE.
Strangely enough these variables show up in the logs like above, when I would have expected them to show the resolved values (i.e., the actual start and end dates used).
Is there a way to get the values of these variables for the queries?
Any hints are greatly appreciated.
