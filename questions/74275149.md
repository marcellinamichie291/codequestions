I have these records in table
Id  TrainerId   Times     GeorgianDate
=========================================
5       34      00011110    2022-11-01 00:00:00.0000000
6       34      11100000    2022-11-02 00:00:00.0000000

I pass a date to the method which fetches all the reocords with GeorgianDate than that date like this
 public async Task<TrainerTimeTableDto> Execute(long userId, DateTime startDateGeorgian)
    {                   
        var dt = startDateGeorgian.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd");
        var request = await _context.School_TrainerTimeTables.
            Where(p => p.Id == userId && p.MiladiDate>= DateTime.Parse(dt))
            .SingleOrDefaultAsync();
      
        return request;
    }

so I pass startDateGeorgian = {01/10/2022 00:00:00} to the method, but it returns null, although there are records in the table
