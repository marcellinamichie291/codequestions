# i want to let the user input a number 3 times at most

import random
attempt =0
while attempt <=3:
rand = random.randint(1,18)
age = int(input(“please input your age:”))
if(int(age) == rand):
        print(“great”)
    elif age< rand:
        print (“smaller than the true value”)
    elif age > rand):
        print (“larger than the true value”)

Generate a random age (1~18), let the user input the age for at most 3 times, if the input is the same as the random number, output 'Great', if it is smaller, output 'Smaller than the true value', if it is larger, output 'Larger than the true value'
my code works but it keep repeating even if it is already more than 3
