# How to trigger the same build on many workers from one scheduler?

What I want is deceptively simple: user presses a single button in ForceScheduler and multiple build requests go to a dozen of workers simultaneously. Right now users repeatedly run the same scheduler multiple times with different worker each time and this is repetitive.
I've tried setting multiple = True, on WorkerChoiceParameter in the most straightforward manner, but this didn't help: only the first worker gets the build request. Also, I've seen that inside Worker class there's a field that hints that it can be done: endpoints = [WorkerEndpoint, WorkersEndpoint]. Looking at WorkersEndpoint (note the "s") I've noted that it tries to get a list of workers, so in theory this should be possible? But I cannot figure out how to tell buildbot to use this second endpoint or maybe I misunderstood what this code does.
