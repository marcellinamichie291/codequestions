# Fetch HTML Page with Js-Dom JavaScript

Im trying to fetch the HTML from this url which works by using JSDOM with:
JSDOM.fromURL("https://rarible.com/collection/" + collection, { runScripts: "dangerously" },{ pretendToBeVisual: true },{resources: "usable"}).then(dom => {
      console.log(dom.serialize()); //turn the page back into HTML
      var rendered= dom.serialize();
      res.status(200).json([{ rendered}]);
});

The thing is that the response i get seems to be unrendered content, meaning there's practically no html, mostly script(see the reponse in the pastebin)
How can i get elements of this page after all the scripts are rendered?
