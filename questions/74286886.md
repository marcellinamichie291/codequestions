# Why jenkins user is not able to read or write in a directory?

Target directory has a group called "website-handlers" which has perms for Read and Write.
Jenkins user is also assigned to the same group and still its unable to perform in desired manner.
I tried playing with perms , but couldnt find what im missing.
