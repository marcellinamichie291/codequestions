# How do I specify a subdirectory when deploying element-web (a Matrix client) from the Docker image?

I launch element-web such as:
element-web:
  image: vectorim/element-web
  container_name: "brigid-element-web"
  ports:
    - 5001:80
  volumes:

It is served behind a reverse-proxy (kong)
Such as:
  - name: matrix-route
paths:
  - /matrix
service: "Matrix"  
path_handling: v0
preserve_host: false
protocols:
  - http
  - https
regex_priority: 0
strip_path: true

Is there a way to specify a subdirectory in the url of element-web?
Such as http://localhost:5001/subdirectory.
I don't see any property allowing this in config.json.
