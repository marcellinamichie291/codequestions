# Is there a way to enforce the order of middlewares running?

I'm trying to ensure one middleware runs before another in my code.
Is there a way to enforce the ordering?
In particular, I'd like to run a middleware before another known middleware.
I can try ordering the registration of the middleware plugin. However, isn't this going to be impacted by the ordering of the dependencies? I'm not so sure that this is not going to be brittle.
