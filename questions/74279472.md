I am creating a chess game where a physical bot moves the pieces on a chess board. So, I want the move calculation part to be on my main pc (i.e Ubuntu, cause I use ubuntu pc) and only to move the pieces physically, I want to use raspberry pi because raspberry pi takes a long time to calculate the moves.
Considering that on my Ubuntu pc, I have main.py which calculates the best move possible and gives the output about which piece to move to which location, I want to feed this output to a move_piece_on_board.py on my raspberry pi which controls the motors using the GPIO pins.
Will just connecting the raspberry pi via usb and then importing the class from move_piece_on_board.py from the rasberry pi work?
Is there any way through which I can do this? If so, please do give me a detailed explanation on which library to use and what code to add.
Sincere Thanks!
