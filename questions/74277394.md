# How to check and change super admin in php fusion

I have been put up for maintaining a database written in psql and managed using phpfusion. As a legacy database we no longer remember the password needed to create new 'Super Administrators'. This post was quite helpful https://www.php-fusion.co.uk/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=23353, but I am unsure about the syntax needed to perform the tasks: a) to check who currently has 102 and 103 statuses, and b) how to change one with 102 status to having 103 status.
I have sudo rights so should be able to make the changes needed, but I am unsure about how to go about this.
I also have access to the database so can run psql commands, but I am assuming I would need to be outside the database and logged in as postgres@database
Any help would be great, thanks.
