# How to disable local package dependency for `npm install --prefix`?

I have a project with at its root the following simplified package.json file:
package.json
{
  "name": "parent-project",
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  }
}

In a subfolder that we'll call child-project, another package.json resides:
child-project / package.json
{
  "name": "child-project",
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  }
}

Some code that I depend on uses the command npm --prefix ./child-project install to install dependencies in child-project. However, this always has the undesirable side-effect of altering child-project/package.json like so:
{
  "name": "child-project",
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "parent-project": "file:.." // <- I don't want this!
  }
}

When I execute cd ./child-project && npm install all is fine and child-project/package.json remains untouched, so my hunch is that it has to do with --prefix but documentation on --prefix is very obscure.
Is there a way to disable this behaviour and prevent NPM from altering the child-project/package.json?
