# Connecting to ec2 using ansible

I have an ansible playbook that needs to configure an ec2 instance. The playbook runs from circleci pipeline. I have added the ssh keys to circleci and generated the fingerprint. Running the ansible playbook in circleci
      - add_ssh_keys:
          fingerprints: [xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx]
      - run: 
          name: "install ansible"
          command: |
            apk add --update ansible
            ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory --private-key=$fingerprints

generates the following error
fatal: [ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "timed out", "unreachable": true}

How can I solve this problem?
