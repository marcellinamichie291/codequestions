# Joining 2 tables with part of a Composite Primary key in JPA, Hibernate

I have an old database where can't change the schema so I have to adapt my code to work.
Within that db I have two tables which I'd like to join.
The main Table called SFTSEB2 has a 5 Column Composite primary key: empfkey, ebmsg, ebbord, ebsort, ebrefn only these will going to fulfill the uniqueness on that Table.
I'd like to join SFTSEB3 to SFTSEB2 but based on only 4 Columns: empfkey, ebmsg, ebbord, ebsort
Entites:
@Entity
@Table(name = "SFTSEB2")
@IdClass(Sftseb2ID.class)
@Immutable
public class Sftseb2 {
    @Id
    private String empfkey;
    
    @Id
    private String ebmsg;
    
    @Id
    private String ebbord;
    
    @Id
    private int ebsort;

    private int ebbpos;

    private String ebsdgn;
    
    @Id
    private String ebrefn;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumns({
            @JoinColumn(name = "empfkey", referencedColumnName = "empfkey", insertable = false, updatable = false),
            @JoinColumn(name = "ebmsg", referencedColumnName = "ebmsg", insertable = false, updatable = false),
            @JoinColumn(name = "ebbord", referencedColumnName = "ebbord", insertable = false, updatable = false),
            @JoinColumn(name = "ebsort", referencedColumnName = "ebsort", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    })
    List<Sftseb3> sftseb3;
    
    //GettersSetters
    ...
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "SFTSEB3")
@IdClass(Sftseb3ID.class)
@Immutable
public class Sftseb3 {
    @Id
    private String empfkey;
    
    @Id
    private String ebmsg;
    
    @Id
    private String ebbord;
    
    @Id
    private int ebsort;
    
    @Id
    private int ebsrt2;
    
    @Id
    private String ebsdgn;
   
    private int ebbpos;
    
    private String ebstst;
    
    private String ebstsc;
    
    
    //GettersSetters
    //...
}

Unfortunately I can get past this because hibernate is giving back:
 A Foreign key refering Sftseb2 from Sftseb3 has the wrong number of column. should be 5
I tried to have a bi-directional mapping so the complete JoinColumns part went to Sftseb3 with a @ManyToOne and Sftseb2 would only contain the mappedBy at the @OneToMany but I got the same issue.
As I see there is no way to have different PK on an entity and Join another table to it based on part of the PK or even other columns? Why?
If I reduce the number of @Id columns to match in the two tables so Sftseb2's @Ids: empfkey, ebmsg, ebbord, ebsort then it starts to work, however because this is non-unique all instances of Sftseb2 will be the same...
