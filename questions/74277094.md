For Code
Expo Snack> https://snack.expo.dev/@stefanosalexandrou/frowning-raisins
What I want to achieve:
I want selected item Fadeout (or add any animation). How can achieve to add animation only on Selected Item.
I don't like this way,
const backgroundColor = item.id === selectedId ? "#6e3b6e" : "#f9c2ff";

There is any other way?
