# Typescript - Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'any' can't be used to index type 'typeof EnumUrl'.ts(7053)

in non .tsx pages we used to enum like this:
const enumUrl= {
  xxx: [BRAND],
  yyy: [BRAND],
};

In .tsx pages I would like to use enum. So I created:
  enum EnumUrl {
    xxx = "https://example.com/",
    yyy = "https://example.net"
  }

And in JSX:
  Visit <a href={EnumUrl[BRAND}} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    {EnumUrl[BRAND]}
  </a>

However it says:
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'any' can't be used to index type 'typeof EnumUrl'.ts(7053)

Then I read this possible solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/41970976/1580094
and did the following:
  enum EnumUrl {
    xxx = "https://example.com/",
    yyy = "https://example.net"
  }

var url : EnumUrl = EnumUrl[BRAND as keyof typeof EnumUrl];

 ...   

 Visit <a href={url[BRAND}} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    {url[BRAND]}
  </a>

But doing  this way, the <a element completely disappears from DOM. No errors.
What am I doing wrong and how can I fix it?
