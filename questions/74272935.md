# cypress response time action for page load and functions

I am trying to implement the response time for the cypress test such us time that took something to happen after clicking, page loads etc. I have seen one copy of this and if we set up something like this can we assert it for the "time limit" and then have like assertion for specifictime that test will run this reaction and fails if he overdues on time on it ?
Example something like this:
let t1 = Date.now();

        let t2 = null;

        var start = 0;
            cy.then(() => {
            start = performance.now();
            });
            cy.get('[data-cy="login"]').click()
                // .then(() => {
                // cy.log(`duration: ${performance.now() - start} ms`);
            // });


            .then(() => t2 = new Date());
        
            cy.get('[data-cy="login"]', { timeout: 20000 })
                .should(elements => {
                expect(elements.length).to.eq(0);
                t2 = new Date();
            })
            .then(() => cy.log(`duration: ${(t2-t1)/1000} seconds`))
    })
