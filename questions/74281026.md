# Apply border-radius to cropped react props of large image URLs with different dimensions using CSS

To match a learning project's figma file (https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal), my CSS for the Japanese Unsplash images is:
top: 100px;
width: 125px;
height: 168px;
border-radius: 5px;
fix border radius */
padding-right: 20px;

and my react code is:
<img src={props.imageUrl} alt="" className="body__card" />

my trouble is that I am unable to both CROP the react image prop I get from the data.js file AND  have the CSS border apply to the cropped image. It only crops on the left side. If I increase the border-radius to say, 50px, the left side's borders have a very different radius than the right side.
