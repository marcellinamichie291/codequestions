# Animate a tkinter frame

I want to create a tkinter animation in which a frame on all its contents move from right to left. After clicking the button, the frame and its contents should  move from left to right. I was able to achieve the former  but when I click the button, the frame and its contents disappear.


import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import *

def contract(i):
    if i<=425:
        b.place(x=i)
        b.after(5, lambda: contract(i))
        i = i+1

def expand(i):
    if i>=100:
        b.place(x=i)
        b.after(5, lambda: expand(i)) 
        i = i-1
        
root = tk.Tk()
root.geometry('425x670')
b =Frame(root,bg='red',height=670,width=400)
b.pack()
b.grid_propagate(0)
button=Button(b,text="withdraw",command=lambda: contract(425))
button.grid(row=0,column=0)




expand(425) 
root.mainloop()
---------------------------------

I'd like a solution that would fix this problem.

I'm just a beginner at tkinter and I would appreciate your help!
