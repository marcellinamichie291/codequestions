# How can I ignore missing values in multiple t-tests?

I have been using this code for a while to do t-tests on multiple (300+) variables simultaneously. It has always worked in the past but for one particular dataset I am getting an error saying that there are not enough observations. I think it is because there are a lot of NA values for some of the variables. Is there a way to adjust the code so that it just ignores these variables and continues to perform t-tests for the remaining variables?
This is the code I have been using:
# Put all variables in the same column except the grouping variable
Bio.test.long <- Bio.test %>%
  pivot_longer(-Bacterial.v.viral, names_to = "variables", values_to = "value")
Bio.test.long %>% sample_n(6)

t.test.bio <- Bio.test.long %>%
  group_by(variables) %>%
  t_test(value ~ Bacterial.v.viral) %>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "none") %>%
  add_significance()
t.test.bio

Error in mutate_cols():
! Problem with mutate() column data.
i data = map(.data$data, .f, ...).
x not enough 'y' observations
Caused by error in t.test.default():
! not enough 'y' observations
Run rlang::last_error() to see where the error occurred
