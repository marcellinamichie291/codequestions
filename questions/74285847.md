# FlexNet Connect "Device not supported" when calling ConnectFactory.GetConnect

We have a FlexNet client application that runs ok on one machine, but on another ConnectFactory.GetConnect(identity, storagePath) throws this exception:
FlxDotNetClient.PublicConnectException A service system error was encountered: Device not supported. [1,7DF,3,2[73000093,0,400400CC][73000092,0,40040080]]
We are using FlexNet Connect 2015.03.2 on two PCs with identical specs. It seems environmental but I haven't been able to find information about what causes the exception.
What does GetConnect look for to decide a device is not supported?
