# iOS build of React Native project stuck on User defaults from command line: IDEPackageSupportUseBuiltinSCM = YES

I am trying to build a React Native Project with npx react-native run-ios --simulator='iPhone 14 Pro' --verbose to see any helpful output, but it remains stuck with the following CLI output:
    info Found Xcode workspace "myapp.xcworkspace"
    info Building (using "xcodebuild -workspace myapp.xcworkspace -configuration Debug -scheme myapp -destination id=2A2B9240-3EBA-4BF1-8B43-215151CFB12B")
    debug Command line invocation:
    
    debug /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -workspace myapp.xcworkspace -configuration Debug -scheme myapp -destination id=2A2B9240-3EBA-4BF1-8B43-215151CFB12B

    User defaults from command line:
        IDEPackageSupportUseBuiltinSCM = YES

I can't understand what User defaults from command line: IDEPackageSupportUseBuiltinSCM = YES is, I've tried to search but without success.
I have Xcode 14, iOS simulator version 16.0.0 and everything is running on a M1 chip
