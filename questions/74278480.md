# Stored procedure to create a user for mysql5 or mysql 8 depending on the version of mysql

Basically I am trying to create a stored procedure with an if else statement that checks the mysql server version and based on the version executes a create user with the correct mysql syntax to create the user. we have a mysql 5 and mysql 8 server, and depending on the customers choice we need to create a user on the specific server version, ie mysql 8 or 5
USE test;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS add_user ;

CREATE PROCEDURE add_user()
BEGIN
IF (SELECT VERSION() = '5.7.20-log') THEN
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'akoos'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
ELSE
    CREATE USER 'akoos'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
    GRANT ALL ON test.* TO 'akoos'@'localhost';
END IF ;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
END
;
CALL add_user() ;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS add_user ;

I tried this but I keep getting syntax errors, all i need to do is create a stored procedure with the correct syntax to create the user and grant privilidges based on the server version its executed on. Ie if its 5 execute the mysql 5 code for creating a user, if its mysql 8 execute the code for creating a user in mysql 8 syntax.  The reason I need this is the wordpress intaller that we use has a mysql script which creates the below code
Mysql 5 code
USE test;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS add_user ;

CREATE PROCEDURE add_user()
BEGIN
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'akoos'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
END
;
CALL add_user() ;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS add_user ;

Mysql 8 needs to use the following syntax to create a user
CREATE USER 'akoos'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
GRANT ALL ON test.* TO 'akoos'@'localhost';

So I want to use an if else statement to create a stored proc based on the db server version used
