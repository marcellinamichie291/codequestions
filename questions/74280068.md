# tidyr mutate new column based on group by with calculation

Using tidyr, how can I create a new column through a group-by and calculation?
For example, if I have this dataframe:
name <- c("a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b")
x1 <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
x2 <- c(15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15)
y <- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
z <- c(50, 100, 40, 90, 65, 95, 40, 95)

df <- data.frame(name, x1, x2, y, z)

Let's say I want to (1) group-by x1 and x2; (2) find the max z value in that group; and (3) create a new column z2 that normalized z by that maximum.

So in this case, the expected output for z2 is c(0.5, 1, 0.4, 0.9, 0.684, 1, 0.421, 1).
