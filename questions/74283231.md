# Is there anything faster than an array of atomic references to pass a sequence of objects between two threads?

I am writing an application that has to pass messages unidirectionally very fast. For now, I do not want to do bulk transfers.
This application has to be in JAVA and it has to be multithreaded.
So far, using a single thread is at least 10 times faster than the message passing I need, to make the ordeal non-blocking.
I tried several approaches starting from blocking queues to wait-less ones with abysmal outcomes. The general result is that the consumer thread does not see changes fast enough compared to the producer thread thus creating a significant delay.
The fastest (multithreaded) approach I could achieve was using an array of atomic references to store the objects I needed to pass, and an Atomic variable to notify the consumer of the last index that was produced (the consumer spins until a change is reflected between threads).
My next step will be first to reread the whole atomic package documentation and then to try to use an array of volatile objects before venturing into the world of unsafe. I also used set and get directly so I may need to experiment more with CAS semantics to see if there is any other improvement I can achieve.
Does anyone have any suggestions on what is the fastest way to achieve my objective?
