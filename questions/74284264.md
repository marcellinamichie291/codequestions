# How to use plotly.js to plot the spectrum of the signal

I use plotly.js to plot the wave form of the signals (sinewave, AM, FM, SSB, etc.) using their math equations. Everything with the waveform is okay but I cannot find the way to plot those signals in form of spectrum. I've read docs for fft.js or dsp.js but they are not suitable to my poor knowledge of javascript.
Can anyone help me to solve this problem
This is some part of my code to plot the waveform of signal:
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  x[i] = xmax1 * i / (n) ;
  y[i] = amp * Math.cos(2 * pi * x[i] * freq);
}

let trace_init = {
  x: x,
  y: y,
  mode: 'slines',
}

let data = [trace_init]

let layout = {
  plot_bgcolor: "rgba(46, 191, 240, 0.6)",
  title: '',
  xaxis: {
  range: [0, xmax1],
  showaxis: false,
    title: '',
    showgrid: true,
    zeroline: false,
    showline: false,
    showticklabels: false,
    showtick: true
  },
  yaxis: {
    range: [-10.5, 10.5],
    title: '',
    showgrid: true,
    zeroline: false,
    showline: false,
    showticklabels: true,
  },
  margin: {
    l: 25,
    r: 0,
    b: 0,
    t: 0,
    pad: 0,
  },
};

Plotly.newPlot('plot',data,layout, {displayModeBar: false})

I've tried some library working with fast fourier transform such as fft.js, dsp.js or p5.js but they are unsuited my code.
I need some help to solve my problem with plotting signal spectrum using plotly.js
