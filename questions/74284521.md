# Fetching .wav file from firebase and saving it to app's persistent data

I want to download a wav file from firebase(the part I know) and save it to app's persistent data folder(the part I don't know).
What I tried:-


islandRef = storageRef.child("audios/audio.wav");

File localFile = File.createTempFile("audio", "wav");

islandRef.getFile(localFile).addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<FileDownloadTask.TaskSnapshot>() {

    @Override

    public void onSuccess(FileDownloadTask.TaskSnapshot taskSnapshot) {

        // Local temp file has been created

    }

}).addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {

    @Override

    public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) {

        // Handle any errors

    }

});

But the problem is createTempFiles creates files in cache dir of app which may be cleared cause they are "cached" files.
So I replaced
File localFile = File.createTempFile("audio", "wav");

With
File localfile = new File(getFilesdir(),"audio.wav");

But this throws Firebase file storage exception.
