# What is the type of error when authenticating with Google Provider with Firebase

I've following code (screenshot) https://prnt.sc/En-dd4IydfTJ
I'm using typescript, I'm accessing err.email as shown in their docs. but it seems that there is not email property in the error, By console loggin I'm seeing that there is customData property (object) that contains the email property.
Now I need correct type for that error so typescript doesn't complain & I get suggestion. ( I know that I can't type hind the error in the catch block, but I need that type to work inside the block)
Info: I'm using Firebase v9.
