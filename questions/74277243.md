# How to insert the result of a query into a record of record

declare
     type a is record(a1 number, a2 varchar2(10));
     type b is record(b1 number, b2 varchar2(10));
     type c is record(a2 a, b2 b);

      ra a;
      rc c; 
 begin  
      with pa as(   select 1,'a'  from dual)   select pa.* into ra from pa;

  dbms_output.put_line(ra.a2); --works

   with pa as( select 1, 'a' from dual)-- expression 'RC' in the INTO list is of wrong type       
    select pa.*,pa.* into rc from pa;

    with pa as( select 1, 'a' from dual) --invalid user.table.column, table.column, or column specification
    select a(pa.*),b(pa.*) into rc from pa;

    with pa as( select 1, 'a' from dual) --invalid user.table.column, table.column, or column specification    
    select c(a(pa.*),b(pa.*)) into rc from pa;
     
      end;

I've the record c which is a record of record. I would like to insert in c the result of a query. In this example I have tried wiht 3 different way. It doesn't work.
Is it possible and how?
