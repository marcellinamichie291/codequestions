# Mstrweb getting newWindow is undefined

I am using mstrweb microstrateg, without any change I am getting the error like
bone-global.js?v=-1689619172:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: newWindow is not defined at microstrategy.submitForm (bone-global.js?v=-1689619172:1:291538) at microstrategy.loadIframeIdle (bone-global.js?v=-1689619172:1:293580) at mstrWeb:1072:45
Seems browser version issue? But facing the same issue on all browser now.
I am trying generate the mstrweb reporting on the url
Mstr/servlet/undefined
I am getting now undefined in the url
