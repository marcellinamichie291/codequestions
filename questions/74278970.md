# Database query using Grouping Sets

I'm using Oracle and SQL Developer. I have downloaded schema Sales History and need to do some queries with it. I'm working with table PRODUCTS. As an user I need the sum of PROD_LIST_PRICE per PROD_CATEGORY,  PROD_SUBCATEGORY,  SUPPLIER_ID and also the sum per PROD_CATEGORY. I need to provide solution by GROUPING SETS. I do something like this, but seems that it's quite wrong:
WITH ds as(
  SELECT prod_category, prod_subcategory, supplier_id, sum(prod_list_price) sum_all,
GROUPING_ID (prod_category, prod_subcategory, supplier_id) group_id
FROM products
GROUP BY 
GROUPING SETS (
                (prod_category, prod_subcategory, supplier_id), ()
                )
)
SELECT decode ( GROUPING (prod_category), 1, 'Total', 0, prod_category) cat,
SUM(prod_list_price) sum_prod
FROM ds
GROUP BY 
GROUPING SETS( (prod_category), ())
ORDER BY prod_category; 

Maybe I don't understand correctly the conditions. How can I fix this query or modify to do exactly what I need?
