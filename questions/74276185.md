# Updating Values of JSONB with the help of current value

I have a database having columns id and profile fields where profile fields is of the type jsonb




id
profile_fields




101
{"1":"Chess" , "2":"08-02-2001"}


102
{"1":"Hockey" , "2":"1996-06-09"}




In profile fields the key 2 stands for Date of Birth .
Unfortunately many fields have values in format yyyy/mm/dd .
I would like to change all the Date of birth values in dd/mm/yyyy format.
The Expected results is like this




header 1
header 2




101
{"1":"Chess" , "2":"08-02-2001"}


102
{"1":"Hockey" , "2":"09-06-1996"}




I tried the update the update statement but i am stuck how can i apply in multiple values ? What will go inside where statement. And how to access the key 2 profile_fields->"2" is not in Update statement.
Thank you.
