# nextJS 12 middleware breaking Plesk Site

I have nailed the issue down to the middleware as it was breaking everything. We host the site on Plesk so we understand that there maybe something that the server is doing differently.
However when I go to https://exampl.com/appstore
I should get a nice looking page but now I get

I have tried everything to fix it, so I thought I would post here.
// middleware.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse, userAgent } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { os } = userAgent(request)


  if(request.nextUrl.pathname === "/appstore")
  {
    if(os.name === "iOS"){
      return NextResponse.redirect('https://apps.apple.com/au/app/drn1/id1491656217')
    }
    if(os.name === "Android"){
      return NextResponse.redirect('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drn1.drn_player')
    }
 
 }
};


export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/appstore'
  ],
}

I can confirm however that on Vercel servers it works fine - with no issues (https://drn-1-next-js.vercel.app/appstore).
This is what makes me think it's a plesk issue or the way NextJS dev teams have coded middleware.
