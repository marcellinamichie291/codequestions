# Bulk insert or update for the given where

I have a function that gets $homes and $member_id as parameters. $homes is an array, $member_id is an integer.
$homes = array( 'home13', 'home21', 'home34', 'home44' );
$member_id = 5;

How do I insert/update into the following DB?

in the format:
id  home_name member_id
1   home13     5
2   home21     5
2   home34     5
2   home44     5

The function I used:
public function store($homes, $member_id) {
      foreach( $homes as $home ) {
            $data[] = [ 'member_id' => $member_id, 'home_name' => $home ];
        }
      Home::insert( $data );
}

which works fine while inserting. However, I need to update all records for a given $member_id if the member_id already exists.
For example, if the $member_id is 5 and $homes is now array( 'home54' ), all other home_name that are previously stored for the $member_id 5 should be deleted. so that the following would only remain.
id  home_name member_id
1   home54     5
