# Chat server - can't receive message while getting input from user

I'll clarify:
I am currently writing a small chat server in python using socket and select.
A message that a client sends, is sent to all other client.
The problem I have faced is, when a client sends a message, the other clients receive the message only after they send a message themselves.
Below is my client code:
def client_input(u_name):
    print(f"{u_name}>", end="")
    msg = ""
    done = False
    while not done:
        if msvcrt.kbhit():
            pressed = msvcrt.getch()
            if pressed == b"\r":
                print("")
                done = True
            else:
                print(pressed.decode(), end="")
                msg += pressed.decode()
    return msg


while True:

    message = client_input(username)

    if message:
        # Encode message to bytes, prepare header and convert to bytes, like for username above, then send
        message = message.encode()
        message_header = f"{len(message):<{HEADER_LENGTH}}".encode()
        client.send(message_header + message)
    try:
        while True:
            username_header = client.recv(HEADER_LENGTH)

            if not len(username_header):
                print('Connection closed by the server')
                sys.exit()

            # actual username
            sender_username_length = int(username_header.decode().strip())
            sender_username = client.recv(sender_username_length).decode()

            sender_message_header = client.recv(HEADER_LENGTH)
            sender_message_length = int(sender_message_header.decode().strip())
            sender_msg = client.recv(sender_message_length).decode()

            now = datetime.now()
            current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
            print(f"<{current_time}> {sender_username}: {sender_msg}")

    except IOError as error:
        if error.errno != errno.EAGAIN and error.errno != errno.EWOULDBLOCK:
            print(f"There was some error reading data: {str(error)}")
            sys.exit()

        # no data was received (everything's fine)
        continue
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"There was some error reading data: {str(error)}")
        sys.exit()

client.close()

I am using msvcrt module to retrieve the keyboard presses of the user without having to block the program when asking for input.
I've tried turning the client_input function to a Thread. It didn't work (It just went over the function again and again... I didnt really understand what happened.
Any help would be appreciated
