# Tensorboard Giving Black Feedback Images

This is my first time trying to train a model with model_main_tf2.py from the TFOD repo, so I followed the guide at https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html. I'm also using the ssd_mobilenet_v2 320x320 model from the model zoo. However, when I pull up tensorboard using,
tensorboard --logdir=models/ssd_mobilenet_v2

I only see black images:  I would assume this means it's not properly training, but the graphs looks fairly reasonable (I think):

I've seen tensorboard in the past and know it's supposed to have a detection and original image with bounding boxes, so I know this is very broken. I went ahead and tested the model and, as I assumed, it didn't work. I've tried a couple of different versions of tensorboard and tensorflow, but not all of them. I'm assuming it's a version error somewhere, since I followed the guide completely except for when I was thrown an error. If I left out anything I apologize, this is my first time doing anything programming-related. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Current versions:
Python 3.9.13
Tensorflow 2.10.0
Tensorboard 2.9.1
