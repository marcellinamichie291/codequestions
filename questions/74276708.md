# how to change color of polygons using geoJson fields in leaflet

I have a geoJson file whitch looks like this (this is just the first object as an example):
[
    {
      "type" : "FeatureCollection",
      "features" : [
        {
          "type" : "Feature",
          "id" : 0,
          "regionColor": "orangeColor",
          "geometry" : {
            "type" : "Polygon",
            "coordinates" : [...]
          },
          "properties" : {
            "FID" : 0,
            "FID_1" : 0
          }
    }
]

I want to color each polygon according to the "regionColor" field but can't find a way to do so.
