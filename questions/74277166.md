Is there any way to authenticate WPF application using Azure Active Directory from a custom made wpf login window? instead of using the default browser page? given a password and username.
I was following this tutorial on how to authenticate wpf using Azure AD: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/configure-authentication-sample-wpf-desktop-app
From my investigation, all examples I found uses the method in: IPublicClientApplication
app.AcquireTokenInteractive to open a default window for login.

Instead, I am looking for a way to authenticate through a custom window.
Thanks in advance.
