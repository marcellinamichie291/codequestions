# Standalone Opentelemetry collector coded in C#, a viable endeavour?

Is there any public domain C# code that illustrates how to receive Opentelemetry data
across a network connection? I have spent hours searching for such an example and the absence of example code leads me to wonder if there are hidden complexities.
I want to develop a standalone Opentelemetry program that receives OTEL traces across a network sent using the standard OTLP protocol.
The .Net implementation of OpenTelemetry specifies many extension points such as a Sampler and a Processor but these seem oriented to the situation where application generated tracing data is already in memory and requires custom interception prior to export across a network.
The OLTP protocol has a GRPC/Protobuf implementation so maybe the answer to my question is to find the .proto idl definition for OLTP-GRPC and let Visual Studio generate a GRPC service from that.
