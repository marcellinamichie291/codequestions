# Customizing Quarto Tables in R

Â¿how are you? I am trying to start creating some documents using Quarto in RStudio.
In this moment I am creating tables but it seems untidy. I would like to add some lines between rows but i can not find how to do that. With this code i only create one row at the top and other one at the bottom. Hope you can help me, already thanks.
Here is the code:
|                               |        |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Cantidad de eventos           | `r a0` |
| Monto Apuesta (\$)            | `r a1` |
| Monto Acierto (\$)            | `r a2` |
| Ganancia (\$)                 | `r a3` |
| Repago (%)                    | `r a4` |
| Cantidad de usuarios          | `r a5` |
| Cantidad de apuestas          | `r a6` |
| Cantidad de usuarios (nuevos) | `r a7` |
| Extra 1                       | `r a8` |
| Extra 2                       | `r a9` |
