# Spliting and extracting some data from a text C++

I'm new to C++ and I have a basic question. I want to split this text: C45c 6%|G50c 0%|R9,7GB|RA22,2|RL30|GMTGMT|GMUGMU|GMLGML|GFANL0|G
I want to extract the "45" between "C & c", "6" between " " & "%|" and "50" between "G" and "c ".
Can someone help me with it?
PR: C++
I tried to store this data in a string and from there I got blocked and I can't find the solution nowhere.
