# Django: How to automatically fill previous users in the user field of a new model that uses OneToOne relation

I have a conventional project that stores users in auth_user django table.
Later, I decided to implement a profiles app. The views.py code is below
class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

I do makemigrations and migrate. The table is created with empty data, i.e., previous users that exist in auth_user were not populated in the profiles_profile table.
How can I populate old data in my new table?
Thanks
