# RMarkdown slidy presentation: logo & background image

I am creating a report using slidy presentation and trying to embed a logo for all the slides and a background image in the first slide (As a cover page). I have been trying for a while now, but unfortunately with no luck. The code I have works perfectly fine with ioslides presentation not slidy, and I want to use slidy as the size of the page is wider than ioslides. Please help

title: "10"
output:
   slidy_presentation:
      css: styles.css
logo : logo.png
biglogo : logo.png
date: "2022-11-01"
runtime: shiny

The CSS file "styles.css":

slides>slide.title-slide {
    background-image: url('logo_1.png');
    background-size: 100% 100%;
}
