# How can I write this SQL query for date and time?

I'm trying to make a query that will look like
SELECT * from `table` WHERE args
I need to have my args the date from 'yesterday' and time 23:00 until date'Today' and time 22:59.
I'm very bad at writing SQL and I will need masters help for this one.
I know how to write basic SQL and I'm not sure how to write.
Date and time are 2 different rows.
Basic SQL stuff.
Expecting all data from date yesterday starting with time 23:00 until date = today and time = 22:59
Logically is simple, I'm just bad at writing SQL logic.
Date has to be always generated based on current date, time will be static.
SELECT * from `table` WHERE date= Yesterday And time= 23:00 TO date=today time=22:59

Database is MariaDB from Xamp
