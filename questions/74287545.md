# Install-Package : The following commands are already available on this system

When I try to install AWSPowerShell, I am getting the following error:

PackageManagement\Install-Package : The following commands are already available on this system:'Clear-AWSCredentials,Clear-AWSDefaults,Confirm-EC2EndpointConnection,Confirm-EC2ReservedInstancesExchangeQuote,Confirm-EC2TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment,Confirm-EC2TransitGatewayVpcAttachment,Confirm-EC2VpcPeeringConnection,Edit-EC2Hosts,.........

How can I find out which modules to uninstall in order to fix the error?
