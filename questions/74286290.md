# How to start reading code of big opensource project?

I've been using React for several years, but I've never read the code, even though I've read a lot of documentation. I tried to read the code to get a little deeper understanding, but I was overwhelmed by the amount of code and I have no idea where to start. If you have any good tips on where to start reading the code for not only React, but also other very large open sources, I would be very grateful if you could share them.
I've also read the links below, but I don't mean to add or fix anything. I don't want to understand all of the code (and I don't expect to be able to), but at least I want to see where the starting point is and what modules it is made of, by following the code rather than the documentation.
