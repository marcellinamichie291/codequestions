# Sensor file from gcs to bigquery. If success load it to GCS bucket, else load it to another bucket

I want to build a Dag like this

Description:

I have a file named population_YYYYMMDD.csv in local. Then, I load it to GCS bucket - folder A using GCSObjectExistenceSensor => Done
Then, I transform it using DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator. Transform sth like column name, data type,...
Base on whether the population_YYYYMMDD file was success or failure
If success, I want to load it into Bigquery - dataset A, table named population_YYYYMMDD. And the csv file will move to another folder - Success Folder (Same or Different Bucket is also ok)
If failure, the csv file will move to Failure Folder
