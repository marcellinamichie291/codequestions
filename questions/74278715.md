# Using getInitialProps with an optional Parameter with NextJS

I have a page which allows a user to update a record, lets call it /edit-record, I want to support /edit-record/1 as a route which would load the data (I tried using getInitialProps) but I also want to make it so /edit-record is a page (ideally the same page) but without the API call to fetch the details happening.
So if I pass /edit-record/3 it should fetch record 3, if the url is /edit-record it just awaits user calls.
The issue being I tried a conditional in getInitialProps, a if(query.recordId) {} but the else clause returns a null which NextJS doesnt like; it also just feels a bit wrong in terms of the approach.
What is the better way? Ideally I don't want to create two page files to handle the two conditions as all of the logic is the same.
