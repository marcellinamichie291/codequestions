I found on the net a "bash script" that works very well but. now I would like to turn it into "batch script"
Bash Script
#!/bin/bash

IP="192.168.178.1"
FRITZUSER="fritz1234"
FRITZPW="password1234"
location="/upnp/control/deviceconfig"
uri="urn:dslforum-org:service:DeviceConfig:1"
action='Reboot'
curl -k -m 5 --anyauth -u "$FRITZUSER:$FRITZPW" http://$IP:49000$location -H 'Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"' -H "SoapAction:$uri#$action" -d "\<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?\>\<s:Envelope s:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/' xmlns:s='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'\>\<s:Body\>\<u:$action xmlns:u='$uri'\>\</u:$action\>\</s:Body\>\</s:Envelope\>" -s \> /dev/null

Batch Script
@echo off

SET IP=192.168.178.1
SET FRITZUSER=fritz1234
SET FRITZPW=password1234
SET location=\upnp\control\deviceconfig
SET uri=urn:dslforum-org:service:DeviceConfig:1
SET action=Reboot
curl -k -m 5 --anyauth -u %FRITZUSER%:%FRITZPW% "http://%IP%:49000%location%" -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"" -H "SoapAction:%uri%#%action%" -d "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?><s:Envelope s:encodingStyle='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/' xmlns:s='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'><s:Body><u:%action% xmlns:u='%uri%'></u:%action%></s:Body></s:Envelope>" 


Before writing here I searched the web for the curl documentation of "curl 7.83.1 (Windows) libcurl / 7.83.1 Schannel".
The script does not run, it is obvious that I am doing something wrong. If I run the bash it works.
