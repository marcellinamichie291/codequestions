I am busy developing code that parses through c++ source code and examines the inheritance there. I want to have the program dynamically generate html for representing a UML class diagram of the source code being analysed. Some information:
The program has been written in Python and the UI is a django webpage
The program already extracts the relevant information and can display the files
The class diagram is only for user reference so they can navigate the files with some insight
I am looking into using mermaid and javascript for these purposes but am having some trouble. Any advise would be appreciated.
How to create a dynamic UML-diagram from HTML Tables?
This comes close to a solution but not quite.
Right now I dynamically generate lists the store the relevant class information.
