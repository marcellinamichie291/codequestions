# Adding large arrays in verilog in 8-bit chunks using verilog

I am currently trying to create a module in Verilog that will take 2 inputs of size 2048-bits and perform addition on them where they will be broken into 256 8-bit chunks and added together to prevent a possible carry from 1 being added to the next 8-bits and causing a bad final value.
I have tried the code below and it does give me a proper output under simulation but when moving to synthesis the design is to big.
module addition(
    in_1, in_2,
    out,
);

    input  [2047:0] in_1, in_2;


    output [2047:0] out;
    
    genvar i;

    generate
        for(i = 0; i < 256; i = i + 1)begin
            assign out[i*8+7:i*8] = (in_1[i*8+7:i*8] + in_2[i*8+7:i*8]); 
        end
    endgenerate


endmodule

I was wondering if there was another way perhaps logically to do this so I didn't have to generate 256 8-bit adders but I am struggling to do so. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to cut down on the size here? Thank you for your help
