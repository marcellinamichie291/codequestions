# How to parse/format dates with LocalDateTime? (Java 8)

Java 8 added a new java.time API for working with dates and times (JSR 310).
I have date and time as string (e.g. "2014-04-08 12:30"). How can I obtain a LocalDateTime instance from the given string?
After I finished working with the LocalDateTime object: How can I then convert the LocalDateTime instance back to a string with the same format as shown above?
