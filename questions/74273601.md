# Delphi Thread Handling Best Practice to Pause and Resume

My application continuously syncs data with another database and I am running this process in a thread of which I have very little knowledge.
At certain points in my application I want to pause and resume the thread.
I have read this post "Pausing" A Thread With A Property and the wiki it refers to.
I have implemented the solution offered in the above post.
What I want to know is:

Do I just use PAUSE and UNPAUSE in the parts of my application to suspend the thread and restart it?

I want to test with a button to Pause and Resume the thread but not sure how to implement:
If thread running then Pause else Unpause

Part of the solution offered includes this code:

procedure TMyThread.CheckPause;
var
SignaledEvent: THandleObject;
begin
while not Terminated do
begin
case TEvent.WaitForMultiple(FWaitEvents, INFINITE, False, SignaledEvent) of
wrSignaled: begin
if SignaledEvent = FRunEvent then Exit;
Break;
end;
wrIOCompletion: begin
// retry
end;
wrError: begin
RaiseLastOSError;
end;
end;
SysUtils.Abort;
end
Where to create an entry into a log file to show that the thread is now paused.  I have a simple writelog function to create an entry but where in the above should I put it? The same when the thread is resumed.

Does it matter whether the thread is paused or running when the application terminate? Do I just use this code?

if Assigned(TMyThread) then
begin
TMyThread.Free;
end;
