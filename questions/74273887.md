# Add new Column into Postgres

I have created a new column (fiscal_yr) in a postgres table (dim_surv) but I need to add in my logic to populate the new column with values. Having looked online, I keep seeing 'Alter' table, but I don't have that option. I have Create, Delete, Insert, Select and Update.
This is my logic:
case   
when (dim_surv.month) between 1  and 3  then concat((dim_surv.year) - 1,'-', (dim_dates.year_actual))
when (dim_surv.month) between 4  and 12  then concat((dim_surv.year)-0 ,'-', (dim_surv.year)+1)
end as fiscal_yr

Any idea how I can use this logic to populate the new column, please?
