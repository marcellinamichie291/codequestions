# Hide Column Data but not the whole column in ag-grid

I am using ag-grid in Angular for my tables.
What i want
I want to hide a particular column data but not the whole column as whole. The data is coming from API.
Is there any way or any gridApi or columnApi that allows me to do it?
I have read the documentation and can't seem to find it.
Thankyou.
