# How do i get rid of the degree sign from my integer when i want to convert it from a string in a dictionary?

I have a dictionary as follows:
Measurments = {'Kitchen': '22°', 'Master bedroom': '19°', 'Sitting room': '21°', 'Toilet': '24°', 'Guest bedroom': '18°', 'Garage': '15°', 'Outside': '12°'}

and want to save it in a new dictionary as follows:


newDictionary = {'Kitchen': 22, 'Master bedroom': 19, 'Sitting room': 21, 'Toilet': 24, 'Guest bedroom': 18, 'Garage': 15, 'Outside': 12}



i have tried :

newDictionary = {str(k):int(v) for k,v in measurements.items()}

but it gave me this error code:
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '22°'

How do i get rid of the degree sign so i can get the values as integers?
