# How to make "movie_list" function be defined

*For my code I have three options: View a list of movies, Add to the list, or delete from the list. My problem is I don't know how to define my movie_list function. Down below you can see what I have written down so far. The menu works but for whenever I type list I keep getting an error my_list function is not defined. *
def main():
    movie_list = [["Spirited Away"],["Whiplash"],["The Dark Night"]]  
    

#Menu where you can select to view the list, add a movie to the list, delete a movie from the list, or exit the program.

def movie_menu():
     print("Movie Menu")
     print("list-Display all movies")
     print("add-Add a movie")
     print("del-Delete a movie")
     print("exit-Exit program")
     
     
     
#Program where you type the commands to "add","delete","exit",or "view" the list.
movie_menu()
while True:
    command = input("Command:")
    if command == "list":
        list(movie_list)
    elif command == "add":
        add(movie_list)
    elif command == "del":
        delete(movie_list)
    elif command == "exit":
        break
    else: 
        print("Not a valid command. Please try again.")
print("Goodbye!!")
