# ng-change isn't working for select.(selecting option)

 <select class="map-columns" ng-model="col" ng-change="changeValueInExcelData(false, $parent, $index, col)">
     <option value="power_market">Power market</option>
     <option value="customer">Customer</option>
 </select>

Here i have select with option, Now when i change my option ng-change function isn't calling.
I used ng-change  with input it worked successfully but I don't know why it isn't working for selection.
