# Javascript to check if todays date is after Tuesday at 6pm in current week

I am trying to restrict users from seeing certain information on a landing page to only page by comparing if todays date is after Tuesday at 6pm within the current week.
I have been trying to setup this condition but Date/Time functions aren't my forte.
Using the below I am able to determine the days of the week, but it seems a little buggy in that if within a calendar week a new month starts, the logic resets to the next/previous month.
const today = new Date("2022-11-03 16:20:04");
const first = today.getDate() - today.getDay() + 1;
const tuesday = new Date(today.setDate(first + 1));
const wednesday = new Date(today.setDate(first + 2));
const thursday = new Date(today.setDate(first + 3));
const friday = new Date(today.setDate(first + 4));

console.log('tuesday: ' + tuesday);

const diffTime = Math.abs(tuesday - today);
const diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); 

console.log(diffDays + " days");

I figured by determining by how many days from monday, I could determine if this had been surpassed or not. Unfortunately, this also doesn't take into account time, only date as well.
