# startOf('day') returns a day before in momentjs

I am trying to get the start of the day in momentjs from a new date to filter based on a from and to range in my mongoDB database.
But the format console.logs for me the date -1 day. Why is that?
Here is my code.
note that the date i am sending from my frontend is 2021-09-28, so why does it log a day earlier?
console.log(new Date(moment(to, "YYYY-MM-DD").startOf('day'))) // logs 2021-10-27T21:00:00.000Z

My db query:
  db.collection("Users").find({'from': {$eq: moment(from, "YYYY-MM-DD").startOf('day')")},
  'to': {$eq: moment(to, "YYYY-MM-DD").startOf('day')}})
