I want to add an entity extension to a customer in shopware 6. I was able to do so with the examples in the documentation of shopware on the PHP side and now I wonder how to display and modify this new "field" in the shopware 6 backend.
I searched a lot and also tried to find a simple plugin where I could get some inspiration from, but unfortunately I'm not able to find.
So again the question ðŸ˜Š Is there any simple example on how to add an entity extension for customers with field in the admin of shopware 6? Or an example plugin, where I can see how it could be done?
