# SQL Oracle - create a new column of dates to calculate a count based on datetime field

I have a table showing subscriptions with a column for active date and a column for inactive date. I need a query which counts the number of active subscriptions for each specific date in a date range.
I'm struggling to add in a row for each date in my date range so that I can then compare with the other date columns in my table.
