# SQL: Dividing an input total between two calculations when passing an upper range threshold

We have a stored procedure which calculates a value based on a total number of transactions.
The calculations will apply a certain rate based on the number of transaction entered.
Currently we have:
BEGIN
    IF (@TotalCount BETWEEN 0 AND 60000)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.12
    END
    IF (@TotalCount BETWEEN 60001 AND 120000)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.13
    END
    IF (@TotalCount BETWEEN 120001 AND 240000)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.14
    END
    IF (@TotalCount BETWEEN 240001 AND 480000)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.16
    END
    IF (@TotalCount BETWEEN 480001 AND 1000000)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.18
    END
    IF (@TotalCount > 1000001)
    BEGIN
        SET @temp_Value = @Volume * -0.20
    END
END

This worked for a long while, however I am now running into a problem where if a total of transactions are entered that push the value past the upper range on one calculation, it doesn't know how to split the number of transactions and will calculate all of those transactions at the next rate.
For example:
@TotalCount currently has a value of 55000 and another 7000 transactions are entered, instead of calculating 5000 at 0.12 and the remaining 2000 in the next threshold of 0.13, the whole 7000 will be calculated at 0.13, I am looking for a way to split these values.
I have tried to modify this code using similar methods to how upper/lower tax range calculators function, but not had much luck. I feel like a Case statement could be the way to go, but I am unsure how to structure this.
Any help is appreciated!
