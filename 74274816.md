# Avoid stopping of Julia for REST service

I try to build a little REST service with Julia and Genie library. The last command is up(8888).
When I start this from Julia REPL all is ok.
When I start it from command line like >julia myrestapi.jl the program starts and stops immediately, i.e. up() doesn't go into an infinite loop.
What can I do to keep the server running?
