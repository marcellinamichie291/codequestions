# How to extract current version of windows through kql in Azure?

We are planning to upgrade all our 2012-R2 Servers to 2019 Server, and to do this we need to get an overview of all our 2012 server in Azure.
We are now using the below kql querry to get the information of what version is installed, but we noticed that this is only including the windows version FIRST installed, and not the current installed windows version. Is there any ways to get the current windows version out of an Azure kql script?
Resources 
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
| project resourceGroup, version = properties.storageProfile.imageReference.sku, minorversion=properties.storageProfile.imageReference.exactVersion
| join ResourceContainers on resourceGroup
| project resourceGroup, tags.Description, version, minorversion
