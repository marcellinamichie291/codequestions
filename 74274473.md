# How to find the kernel driver name for the PCIe controller in a running linux system?

I have an Ampere ARMv8 server running Ubuntu 20.04. I want to find out the kernel driver used for the PCIe controllers. How should I do?
My purpose is to prove a hypothesis that for a server to install official distros (such as Ubuntu/Debian w/o modification), the PCIe controller drivers has to be in the kernel source tree for that distro.
Part of the dmesg|grep -i pci output from my Ampere server is as below:
root@ampere:/sys/bus/platform/drivers# dmesg|grep -i pci

And I have the following info from /sys:
root@ampere:/sys/bus/platform/drivers# find . -type d|grep -i pci
