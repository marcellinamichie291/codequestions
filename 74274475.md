I want to study generalized cylinder (see https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2816795.2818074) which includes those surfaces that approximates cylinder. What I want to do is to decribe generalized cylinder more generally, so I tried to define the following:
S = 
where c(x) is a simple planar closed curve,  and f_t is an affine transfromation with time argument t that hold the shape of c(x). Compare to the old definition, my "generalized cylinderâ€œ can be cone, a patch of plane, and includes the following situations:

I want to know:
Is there a name for this kind of surface in differential geometry? And could you recommend some materials about it?
Thanks for your help
