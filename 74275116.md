# GitHub - How to automate editing files?

I have a GitHub repo, where I have multiple files to edit, but I would like to add the exact same line of code to every single of them. It will be under a line of code that is in all of the files. Is there a way I could automate this so I don't have to edit every single file individually? Thanks in advance.
Having to edit every file individually is quite the pain.
