# Push from master branch to main and delete master

I accidentally created a new branch called master, now the project has two branches, main and master, every push and commit goes to master and I want to stay on the initial main branch.
Running git show-ref result:
...07c086 refs/heads/master
...109376 refs/remotes/origin/main

I tried git push origin : main to push from master to main:
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://URL'

How to fix this and eventually delete master branch?
