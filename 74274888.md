# find out the player with highest score in each year

I have a table like these




country
gender
player
score
year




Germany
male
Michael
14
1990


Austria
male
Simon
13
1990


Germany
female
Mila
16
1990


Austria
female
Simona
15
1990




This is a table in the database. It shows 70 countries around the world with player names and gender. It shows which player score how many goals in which year. The years goes from 1990 to 2015. So the table is large. Now I would like to know which female player and which male player score most in every year from 2010 to 2012.
I expect this:




gender
player
score
year




male
Michael
24
2010


male
Simon
19
2011


male
Milos
19
2012


female
Mara
16
2010


female
Simona
16
2011


female
Dania
17
2012




I used that code but got an error
SELECT gender,year,player, max(score) as score from (football) where player = max(score) and year in ('2010','2011','2012') group by 1,2,3

football is the table name
