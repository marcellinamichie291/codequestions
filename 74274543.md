# Write word report with macros that takes data from various excel sheets

for my thesis in word I have to take different data from an excel file and insert them into some equations written in the equation editor of word (for example, if my equation is A = b / c and I know the result is 2, I have to write A = b / c = 8/4 = 2 where 8, 4 and 2 are taken from various sheets of the Excel file, this as proof of the result for the reader). I would like to write a macro in word that:

Opens a specific excel file;
Writes the eq where all the numbers, including the result, are taken from an excel cell;
Copies of graphics from excel.

For now I have only managed to make the first point and a little part of the second (I found how to write a generic equation with the equations editor's format), for the remaining I have only found online codes that copy graphics/tables but they are written in excel, not in word. I'm starting to think it's not possible. Thanks to anyone who can help me!
Open the excel file and write the equation:
Sub openexcelfile()
Dim xlApp As Object
Dim xlBook As Object
Const strWorkbookName As String = "C:\Users\santi\Desktop\Macro\Data.xlsx"
    On Error Resume Next
    Set xlApp = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")
    If Err Then
        Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
    Set xlBook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(FileName:=strWorkbookName)
    xlApp.Visible = True
lbl_Exit:
    Set xlApp = Nothing
    Set xlBook = Nothing
    Exit Sub
End Sub

Sub eq()
Dim objRange As Range
Dim objEq As OMath
 
Set objRange = Selection.Range
objRange.Text = "Celsius = (5/9)(Fahrenheit - 32)"
Set objRange = Selection.OMaths.Add(objRange)
Set objEq = objRange.OMaths(1)
objEq.BuildUp
End Sub
