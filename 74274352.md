# Can't install drupal commerce with composer error

can't install commerce by use composer, I tried both command :

composer require drupal/commerce
composer require 'drupal/inline_entity_form:^1.0@RC


when I used "composer require drupal/commerce" I got error :
"Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages."
Problem 1
- Root composer.json requires drupal/commerce ^2.32 -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce[2.32.0].
- drupal/commerce 2.32.0 requires drupal/inline_entity_form ^1.0@RC -> found drupal/inline_entity_form[dev-1.x, 1.0.0-alpha1, ..., 1.x-dev (alias of dev-1.x)] but it does not match your minimum-stability.
Then I try to install inline-entity-form by used : composer require 'drupal/inline_entity_form:^1.0@RC'
then I got another error :
Package doctrine/reflection is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use roave/better-reflection instead.
Package symfony/debug is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use symfony/error-handler instead.
Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
[RuntimeException]

Please advise what to do, thanks
