# How would I code a program to arrange objects within a shape and return the arrangements that fit the most?

I am seeking to write an program which is given a specific shape (say a circle 7 units across) and it has to fit the greatest number of simple shapes into the space (the shapes in this instance being 3 unit lines, 3 unit T shapes or 3 unit + shapes).
It should run through as many permutations as practical and record (and return) the arrangements that give the highest scores.
I know some java, but i am not sure how to even begin approaching this one. Even trying to google code hasn't come up with anything I can use or a framework to start from.
I'm positive i've seen people do something similar on Youtube before, but have been unable to find anything with any searches i've been able to come up with.
Any help would be appreciated.
