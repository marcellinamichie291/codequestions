# Embedding resources in a pre-built .resources file

I have a project that currently uses ResourceWriter to generate a .resources file by processing some input data. I want to then include the items inside this file in the assembly produced by another project.
I have tried including this file as an "Embedded Resource", but the resources file itself (rather than it's contents) is then listed from Assembly.GetManifestResourceNames(). Changing the build action to "Resource" results in even this single file disappearing from the manifest and setting it to "C# Compiler" gives an error message ("not a text file").
I assume there's a good way to achieve what I want. I've considered:

Converting the .resources to a .resx using resgen, but resgen isn't available in the post build actions environment where I'm currently copying the generated files to the other project (and I want to make the solution as portable as possible: no hardcoding sdk paths if I can avoid it)
Changing the original code to generate a .resx file instead. The standard way to do this (System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter) seems to involve using the serializable attribute, which is being deprecated.

Is there anything I can do to include the .resources as it is (a build action I haven't considered, a directive in the project file, etc.)? The documentation indicates this is a normal thing to do "by using a language compiler"!
If not, could somebody offer advice on the most practical way forward?
