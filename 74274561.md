# Slack users automatically join private channels

I'm an owner of a slack workspace but not an admin.
My users can automatically join all private channels once they are signed in and I want to change that.

Am I allowed to do it? because whenever I open private channels in permissions I only see public ones.
Who can change this to make my users able to join a private channel only when they are invited and how to do it ?
