# How to add Image Coordinates to an SVG map?

I'm making a map in HTML. It should have coordinates of the mouse displayed.
All I find are browser windows coordinates.
How can I use coordinates relative to the SVG and not to the window?
Otherwise when the window is smaller the coords of the bottom right of the SVG are different.
I'm new to this and would love a direction.
