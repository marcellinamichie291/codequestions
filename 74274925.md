# Xcode distributing app archive error: The app references non-public symbols

I'm attempting to distribute my app via app store connect from xcode, but i'm hit with the below error:
The app references non-public symbols in Payload/YYYY.app/YYYY: _SSL_CTX_set_options, _SSL_session_reused (ID: XXXX)
(have replaced app name & id with Y/X)
anyone encountered this before? any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks:)
stumped with this one, i've tried searching for _SSL_CTX_set_options, _SSL_session_reused in the app but don't get any results.
