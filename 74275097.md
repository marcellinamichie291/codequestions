# auto load components from folder

How can I auto import all components within a folder?
If for example I have a folder MyFolder and within it I have bunch of ComponentOne, ComponentTwo(component's name may vary), so instead of explicitly write a name of each and every component I want to import, I want to use it somehow like this: import bunchOfComponents from "./MyFolder", so I could iterate over it after and decide what to do with it.
