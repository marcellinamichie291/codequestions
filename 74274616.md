# The set of all strings over {0,1} that do not contain both the sequence “101” and the sequence “010”

I want to write the set of all strings over {0,1} that do not contain both the sequence “101” and the sequence “010” formally.
Is that correct:
{w∈{0,1}* | ∀x,y∈{0,1}s.t w = x101y ⇔ ∀x',y'∈ {0,1},w ≠ x'010y'}
Thanks!
