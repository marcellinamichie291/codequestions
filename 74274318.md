# KML Polystyle colour not showing

I'm trying to generate a custom map on Google's MyMaps using a KML file exported from R. I'm expecting a chloropleth map - a series of polygons each filled with a colour that is based on a separate variable.
I've pasted a simplified structure of the KML file below - there are actually 98 polygons in the actual file, each with their own Style id.
My question is why, when I import this file as a layer in MyMaps, the colour of the polygons are all shown as black? I would've thought that, since they all have a `PolyStyle' tag with a 'color' value, that they should all be displayed with separate colours.
I've tried clearing the cache for MyMaps but that hasn't seemed to do anything.
