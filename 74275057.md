# xpath selenium next sibling - any element

The url is enter link description here
Is there any way in selenium xpath to get value the element just the element which following sibling of located element
//span[contains(text(),"by")]//following-sibling::a
in this code I want to take the next element because sometimes it is not an anchor tag but span
For getting values of Author I am using the way, searching for "by" word element then
x_authors=driver.find_elements(By.XPATH,'//span[contains(text(),"by")]//following-sibling::a')
 x_authors_a=driver.find_elements(By.XPATH,'//span[contains(text(),"by")]//following-sibling::span[1]')
