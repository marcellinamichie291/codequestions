# Do empty structs in C really invoke UB in Clang?

I found out that structures without any named members (and without any members in particular, as I understood) invoke UB in C. Only GNU GCC supports such structures as an extension. I've tried to create a piece of code which will behave differently when compiled using GCC vs. Clang but with no success. I'm wondering if there is a C program that if you compile it via Clang, it will work differently than if it was compiled using GCC. The opposite option, in a nutshell, is that Clang also supports empty structures but this is not mentioned in documentation.
