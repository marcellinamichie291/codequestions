# Laravel - make database changes after PayPal Payment (securely)

Ok, so I've built a Laravel application which gives a paying customer access to content. I've tried Laravel Cashier and Stripe for weeks and it confuses the crap out of me, so I've gone for a far simpler option: a standard PayPal button.
My current solution is this:

User clicks PayPal button to process payment
I added some code to the Paypal button to initiate an XMLHttpRequest after the payment.
This XMLHttpRequest hits an endpoint which runs some code that makes a change to the database, hence allowing the user access to the content.

My question is this: Since the endpoint is visible in the source code, does this potentially mean this is not a secure solution? I'd figure it's less than 1 in 100 people who use this site would know to look in the source code, but potentially, since the endpoint is exposed, wouldn't it be possible to hit the endpoint manually and get access without paying?
If so, would CSRF protection prevent this?
