# Splunk React - Cannot unlink node_modules

I have downloaded a React repo from GitLab, https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard.
However, when I run "yarn install" on the CLI, I keep getting the following error

I have already deleted the node-modules and yarn-lock files but I still get this error.
Can you please help?
