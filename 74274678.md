# generating tokens and sending them to users

I am trying to implement the account activation and password reset functionalities and I would like to review the theory.
I currently have 2 tables, user and token table. The user signs up. I save the user in the db, generate token and send it via email. So here's how I am tackling the problem: I am creating a 16bytes token and using this to create the link e.ghttp://localhost:1200/api/activation/<token>. However, in the db I am storing the hashed token (hashed with sha256). Then, theoretically, when the user clicks on the link, I perform sha256 on the token and see if it matches with the one stored in the database, right? I think the reason it is recommended to store the hash inside the db is because if the attacker has access to the db, he cannot impersonate the user (it still needs the original token), right?
