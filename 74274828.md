# My Action Pane keeps popping up at start when I open my Excel VSTO document-level even though I forced it to hide

I created an "Excel VSTO document-level" project in Visual Studio. I have a pre designed "Action Pane" and a Tab Ribbon with a button in it to show my action pane.
My problem is my action pane keeps popping up (show) at least 1 time and quickly disappears before I do anything.
Here is my code so far in my ribbon:
Imports Microsoft.Office.Tools.Ribbon

Public Class Ribbon1

    Dim actionsPane1 As New ActionsPaneControl1()

    Private Sub Ribbon1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As RibbonUIEventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
        Globals.ThisWorkbook.ActionsPane.Clear()
        Globals.ThisWorkbook.ActionsPane.Controls.Add(actionsPane1)
        actionsPane1.Hide()
        Globals.ThisWorkbook.Application.DisplayDocumentActionTaskPane = False
    End Sub

    Dim boolAP1toggle As Boolean = True
    Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As RibbonControlEventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
        If boolAP1toggle = True Then
            Globals.ThisWorkbook.Application.DisplayDocumentActionTaskPane = True
            actionsPane1.Show()
            boolAP1toggle = False
        Else
            Globals.ThisWorkbook.Application.DisplayDocumentActionTaskPane = False
            actionsPane1.Hide()
            boolAP1toggle = True
        End If
    End Sub
End Class
