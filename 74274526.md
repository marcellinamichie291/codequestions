# PromQL: reuse group label in another metric

I have multiple pods controlled by a workflow. To retrieve the controlling workflow name I have the following query:
group by(owner_name)(kube_pod_owner{owner_kind="Workflow"}).
Now I want to reuse the owner_name field to measure the CPU usage of the pods controlled by the grouped workflows.
For this I think about something like this: container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~"${owner_name}-.*"}.
How do I combine those two statements? Is that even possible?
