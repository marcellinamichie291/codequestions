# Selenium 4 Edge/Chrome Webdriver not working in C#

I have Edge version 107.0.1418.26 and Egde web driver version 107.0.1418.26 (chrome also has the correct versions). Selenium webdriver 4.5.1.
I had everything working a few weeks ago using chrome, I have revisited the project recently and everything has stopped working (reason for also trying Edge).
To restart at the basics I'm using the Microsoft example https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webdriver-chromium/?tabs=c-sharp and Selenium https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/
When I run:
    var driver = new EdgeDriver();
    try
      {
      driver.Url = "https://bing.com";
      ...

The webdriver console opens and initially says 'started successfully' but the c# code times out on the first line stating 'cannot start the driver service on http://localhost:55553'. I get a little more information with the Chrome test.
DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:54097/devtools/browser/8e320eae-3f01-4ae2-9944-414ca8ad36e1
[23128:31564:1101/105231.394:ERROR:device_event_log_impl.cc(215)] [10:52:31.393] Bluetooth: bluetooth_adapter_winrt.cc:1074 Getting Default Adapter failed.

I don't know why it is trying bluetooth!
Initially I thought the problem to be a security issue over a remote desktop connection but I'm now in the office with the same issue. Something is niggling towards security but I can't find any further information or logs.
