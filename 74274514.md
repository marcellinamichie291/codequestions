# RestTemplate response

I have a problem with RestTemplate getForObject response. I tried to get response from this API: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=50.10&longitude=19.00&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,rain_sum,snowfall_sum&timezone=auto but when I tested it by controller if my app gets data correctly, I received this error:

Here is my API Client class: https://snipboard.io/tymczV.jpg and below Dto classes for data from API: https://snipboard.io/JX92lq.jpg https://snipboard.io/jXosn6.jpg
What did I wrong that this error occurs?
