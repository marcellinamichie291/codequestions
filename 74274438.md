# How to use external Login OpenID provider in Asp.Net Core API web app?

My question is how to use an external login (OpenID) provider apart from (google, facebook and known providers...) I have another provider, but i don't know how to add it in startup.cs, can anyone give me an example on how to configure external login ? Thank you.
I tried to follow the same flow of google, but it's quite different.
