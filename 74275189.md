# How to cancel or speed up Ethereum transactions after The Merge?

So, it was easy when it was nonce, but how to cancel or speed up pending transactions on Ethereum when nonce is always = 0?
I tried sending transactions as before, keeping the same nonce deferred tx and just adding the corrected gas, but is it works now?
