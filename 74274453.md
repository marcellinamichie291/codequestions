# difference between two hours - to find hours slept

I need to be able to find hours slept. I would also like the output to be in hours and minutes
if you only have wakeup time and bedtime and no date. Also some bedtimes are after 12am. in R
I tried this
sleepTime <- function(bed, wake){
  wake <- paste(Sys.Date(), wake)
  tmpbed <- paste(Sys.Date(), bed)
  d <- apply(data.frame(tmpbed, wake), 1, function(x) difftime(x[2], x[1], units = "hours"))
  adjust <- -(d < 0) 
  tmpbed <- paste(Sys.Date() + adjust, bed) 
  apply(data.frame(tmpbed, wake), 1, function(x) difftime(x[2], x[1], units = "hours"))
}

which works, but only gives out hours. Also I dont understand how this code works so if it could be explained or made more basic that would be great :)
