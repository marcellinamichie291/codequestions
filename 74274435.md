# Restricting selection of items on selection of specific item in Multiselect

I am using multiselect pugin to implement multiselect list in my flutter project. In the project I want to add the functionality like,
the option in list are all, first, second, third
Now when I select the all option then the multiselect should restrict the user from selecting other options as he has already selected all option. and when user selects the remaining options from the list except all then he should be restricted from selecting all.
Is it possible to achieve in flutter? I've tried few options like restricting the list showing values or adding vlidation but not getting expected result.
The plugin I am using is: https://pub.dev/packages/multiselect
Please help me with the slution...
I wouldn't mind using custom build multilist with expected properties.
