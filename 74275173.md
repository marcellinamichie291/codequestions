# Is it possible to grant a Bigquery authorized view without anything else using only one dataset

In this they seem to be using a separate datasets for the views and underlying tables. And granting the whole views dataset to grantee.
Is it necessary to use separate datasets provided I'll only grant BigQuery Data Viewer on the view instead?
