# Acf issue with custom post

We have a website setup with several custom post types.
rpl_brand: Brands in database
rpl_product: Products in database
Using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, we associate rpl_products with the appropriate rpl_brand (as post object).
We need a custom function to query all relevant rpl_product based on the display of rpl_brand, something like this:
post_type = rpl_product
post_status = publish
(then query all rpl_products with the same rpl_brand association)
I want to fix this please help me
