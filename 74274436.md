# Igraph / CINNA : Weight the vertices with the information centrality (calculated with the CINNA package)

I work on a real connected network of 21 vertices and 44 links.
I used the CINNA package to calculate two centralities: Information Centrality and Residual Closeness Centrality.
The package proposes a visualization of each centrality with the visualize_graph function but I can't add a legend, modify the layout etc. So I want to plot the graph very simply with the plot function by weighting the size of the vertices to the two centrality measures to produce two different graphs.
The only problem is that when I associate this measure to the size of the vertices as can be done with any node attribute, it doesn't work and the console says "non-numerical argument for a binary operator". I can't identify the problem.
> V(g_comp[[1]])$Residual.C <- calculate_centralities(g_comp[[1]], include = "Residual Closeness Centrality")

V(g_comp[[1]])$size <- V(g_comp[[1]])$Residual.C*3 #HERE it doesn't work

plot(g_comp[[1]],layout = layout_with_fr,vertex.color = 'grey82', edge.color = "black", vertex.label.family = "Times", vertex.label.color="black")

I wonder to what extent the problem is not due to the fact that before the measurement, I had an unrelated network (igraph object named multi.net) on which I used the giant_component_extract function to extract the main related component.
g_comp <- giant_component_extract(multi.net, directed = FALSE, bipartite_proj= FALSE, num_proj = 1 )
I am a newcomer to this type of forum and I don't know exactly what else to say... Hope it's can be suffisant. In advance thanks
