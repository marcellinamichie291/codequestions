# Spring Boot JPA Hibernate Search Optimisation

I'm developing a Spring Boot application right now. It's part of microservice architecture and implements a search using JPA Specifications. And then maps into DTO before returning to results. The schema is like this:
Controller --> Service --> JPA: Find entities
JPA --> Service --> Controller: Return 
Controller --> Mapper: Map into DTO (MapStruct)

The problem
The entity I'm doing a search against does have a lot of dependencies (at least
15 of @ManyToOne and @OneToOne) and it takes 500ms to load just one whole entity. So for loading a list of 50 entities, it takes between 5 and 25 s, which is a problem in the microservice architecture.
What I've tried:

I've used JCache to reduce the execution time to 5s, from 25s ✅
I loaded all in EAGER mode: It's taking 500ms incompressible time ❌
I loaded all in LAZY mode:

it's taking 5ms for all 50 entities before mapping into DTO ✅
But mapping them into DTO causes loading to hibernate proxies -> All over it's taking 500ms again ❌


I tried using different threads to map to DTO (parallelism) -> JPA is blocking anyway, so it's still taking 500ms ❌
I tried then using R2DBC but it's not working properly inside a blocking app, and not resolving relationships anyway ❌

At this point, the only thing I can think of is:

Changing the application into a reactive one
Loading each dependency by ID manually and using a caching mechanism

This is the point. Do you have any ideas?
