# Gitlab Pipelines API

I am trying to use the gitlab's pipeline api to retreive information about my CI pipelines, but when I use the following command:
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/pipelines"
The curl command redirects me to the login page. I have created a PAC for this but still not able to get it done. Any thougts?
