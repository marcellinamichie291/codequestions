# Why pyinstaller can't find my modules, when Python can?

I have a script and some custom modules in one folder. When I run py my_script.py from this folder, it works perfectly. But when I try compiling it with pyinstaller my_script.py --onefile from the same folder, it does, but my_script.exe fails to run with ModuleNotFoundError. In the build\my_script\warn-my_scrip.txt I can see warnings about not founding my custom modules like this: missing module named my_module - imported by C:\Path\to\my\folder\my_script.py (top-level)
How can I make pyinstaller see my modules?
