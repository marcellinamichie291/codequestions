# HTML/CSS Zoom Email Invite Template Assistance

I'm looking for someone with skills in HTML/CSS that can help me with our Zoom Email Invite Template for Outlook.
I have a design mocked up but lack the skills to have it writen in code. Happy to get any help in assessing if the design is 'do-able' and potentially also getting assistance in having it writen.
Let me know if there is anyone interested in helping out, and i'll provide the design and any further details thats needed.
Thanks!
We've taken this one round internally but haven't been able to get it right.
