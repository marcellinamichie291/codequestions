# sed append comma to each line, except the last line in the block

I am writing a utility script to fix a Verilog code using sed. What I'm trying to do is converting code as follows
input file
my_instance_name
(
   .port1     (port1    )
   .port2     (port2    ) // comment for port line 2
   .port3     (port3    )
   .port4     (port4    ) // comment for port line 4
);

What I want
my_instance_name 
(
   .port1     (port1    ),
   .port2     (port2    ), // comment for port line 2
   .port3     (port3    ), 
   .port4     (port4    ) // comment for port line 4
);

The points are

Append comma just after the closing parenthesis of each 'port' lines
Do not append comma for the last 'port'
Preserve the comments if exist (comment starts with double-slash like C)
Whitespaces are not important. it is only for human readability.
There can be multiple linebreaks after the last port line

If the sed script becomes too complicated, it is also OK to just prepend the comma just before the dot, except the first port line. i.e, the following code is OK although it is not pretty.
my_instance_name 
(
   .port1     (port1    )
   ,.port2     (port2    ) // comment for port line 2
   ,.port3     (port3    )
   ,.port4     (port4    ) // comment for port line 4
);

I could only manage appending commas to all 'port' lines via the following two line
sed -i /^\s*my_instance_name.*/,/);/{s/^\(\s*\..*)\)\(\s*\/\/.*\)/\1,\2/} my_verilog.txt
sed -i /^\s*my_instance_name.*/,/);/{s/^\(\s*\..*)\)\s*\$/\1,/} my_verilog.txt

It detects the code scope from "my_instance_name" to ");". The first line insert comma between the closing parenthesis and comment. The second line is for port lines without comments.
But I have no idea how to exclude the last line.
