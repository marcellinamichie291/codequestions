# Why I am getting 0 at the first index of my newArray in Java?

I made a program to find the same element in two arrays(only once) and take those element in new Array. It is running fine but don't know why I am getting 0 at the first index of my  new arary.
suppose if the answer should like [9,8] but it is printing [0,9,8]! Can you correct me where I am going wrong?
newArray size should be 2 but  I know it should have started with 0 but I am doing this because if I am starting newArray size with 0 - array out of bound exception will occur.
package Arrays;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class InteractionOfTwoArrays {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int arr1[]= new int[] {6,9,8,5};
        int arr2[]= new int[] {9,2,4,1,8};
        
        intersections(arr1,arr2);
    }
    public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[])
    {
        int newArraysize=1;
        for(int i=0; i<arr1.length; i++)
        {
            // for getting size of the array
            
            for(int j=0; j<arr2.length; j++)
            {
                if(arr1[i]==arr2[j])
                {
                    System.out.println(arr1[i]+" and "+arr2[j]+" match!");
                    newArraysize++;
                    System.out.println(newArraysize);
                }
                                    
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(newArraysize);
        
        int newArray[] = new int[newArraysize];
        
        
        
        for(int i=0; i<arr1.length; i++)
        {       
            
            for(int j=0; j<arr2.length;j++)
            {
                if(arr1[i]==arr2[j])
                {
                    newArray[i] = arr1[i];
                    System.out.println(arr1[i]+" moved to "+ newArray[i]);
                    break;
                }
                    
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(newArray));      
    }

}


I have tried to print where I am going wrong but failed to identify.
