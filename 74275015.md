# What parameters does the copy method take in Kotlin?

I have this interface and I want it to be able to use copy method just like how data class does. So I define abstract copy method as this.
interface Fizzbuzz {
  fun clone(params: WhatShouldBeDefinedHere?): Fizzbuzz
}

so the implementation would be
data class Foobar(...): Fizzbuzz {
  override fun clone(...): Fizzbuzz {
    return this.copy(...)
  }
}

but what kind of parameters would it take?
