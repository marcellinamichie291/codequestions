# Creating a plot with the most occurring combinations of two columns

For showing my data I want to create a frequency plot. This plot will be based on the number of times a combination between two columns occur. I have a two columns in a dataset (df):
acq_cc: [CN, IN, CN, CN, CN, IN, CN, CN, CN, ZA]
tar_cc: [GB, ZA, NO, AR, VG, JP, NL, PK, PK, SG]
The value of the columns needs to be combined e.g. CN - GB, IN - ZA. Afterwards, I want to count how often a combination of occurs. In this situation  CN - PK occurs twice.
I used this example but since I have no 'Client' value, I receive an error code. The final frequency plot should show a combination of the top 10 most combinations (on the x-axis) and their counts (on the y-axis).
