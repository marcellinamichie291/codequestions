# VScode shortcut to open new file and edit its name

I saw my course instructor do this, and i would like to know if there is a shortcut already existing or if there is a keybinding i can set.
What i want is, when i am currently editing a file for example, i am in ~/src/components/dashboard/dashboard.js and i press the shortcut and it takes me to the file explorer where i will be allowed to name the new file in the same directory, ie ~/src/components/dashboard/


I basically want the functionality we get when we click on the folder that we want a new file in, and then click the new File icon
