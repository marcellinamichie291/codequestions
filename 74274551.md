# How to convert RGB{N0f8} type to Array{Float64}

I am trying to port the basic neural network application from Andrew Ng's course from Python to Julia but got stuck in this part.
I am using my own data set, and therefore I am creating my own solution to process images and resize them. In order to have the exact same as in the Python code (and to have all images as vectors inside one matrix) I need to convert them from RGB to Array type so I can store them as columns in a matrix, but I keep an error and I can't seem to find information anywhere else.
I'm currently using an adapted version of the idea presented here.
using Images, FileIO, TestImages

cat_path = "path/Cat/"
cat_imgs = joinpath.(cat_path, readdir(cat_path))

function process_image(path_vec::Vector{String}, h::Int64, w::Int64, label::Int64)
  result = zeros((h*w), length(path_vec))
  class = []
  for i in enumerate(path_vec)
    img = load(i[2])::Array{RGB{N0f8},2}
    img = imresize(img,(h,w))::Array{RGB{N0f8},2}
    img = vec(img)::Vector{RGB{N0f8}}
    result[:,i[1]] = img # this is the line where I believe Im getting the error
    push!(class, label) 
  end
  return result, class
end

If I try to change the images from RGB to Gray it works (which makes sense as they will have just one channel and will easily become an array), but if I want to keep all channels in the vector I can't just use save them into the matrix as a Vector{RGB{N0f8}}, and if I try to use img = convert(Array{Float64,1},img) I get the error: MethodError: Cannot convert an object of type RGB{N0f8} to an object of type Float64
I'm not sure how to make the code easily reproducible, but I believe that if you create a folder with a single image and update the file paths it should be possible. Or just running the individual lines inside the function using a test image:
using TestImages
img = testimage("mandrill")
